      "2016,Spring,A Dtacher,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Detachment was the word of the day at A Dtacher (yes, like the labels name, bien sr). Designer Mona Kowalska loves the high concept, and one imagines that today detachment included being unconcerned with the gaze of others. Kowalskas woman, both as she appears on the runway and the real world, dresses for herself. Her intensely arty bend, and taste for clothes that match it, make A Dtacher a cultishly beloved brand among certain shoppers. This season, Kowalska presented them with a lineup of relatively playful offerings.\n",
      "The collection opened with a pair of midi dresses in an Indonesian-inspired floral print, which reemerged later imagined with allover Pop white polka dots. Elsewhere came cardigans in an uncanny kind of amoxicillin pink that you imagined the A Dtacher woman wearing with tongue firmly in cheek (they had Kawakubo-esque allover holes, to boot). The popcorn knits were pretty fun, too.\n",
      "The choice to use hardier materials lent dresses eccentric volumes, but also led to a lineup that often felt frumpy, albeit fashionably so. At times the clothes lacked the excitement and want-it-now appeal of Kowalskas Spring collection a year ago. Still, when you looked around the room at todays show and spotted women from all walks of life wearing A Dtacher clothes from various seasons gone by, you could be sure theyd find plenty to like here, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,A.F. Vandevorst,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"You heard this collection coming long before you saw it: a gutsy roar that grew to a crescendo as the models rode around the block from backstage into the courtyard of the Facult de Mdecine Paris Descartes. They were riding pillion on a 25-strong lineup of muscle bikesHarleys and Triumphs. This was because, as An Vandevorst explained pre-show: Its a road trip by a woman who lives in the East and has traveled to the West. Hence the mirrored Indian beading of lean biker-touched separates and fabulous goth-influenced saris, and the silver-shot Chinese brocade on cheongsam-biker hybrids. None of these souvenir details was especially literal; a studded, textured, and collarless burgundy jacket looked Chanel-meets-Mongolia (via Antwerp) and made a fine cupola to the elaborately tented blue pliss skirt below.\n",
      "Vandevorst ticsfrogging, tailoring, leanness, sculpted volume for effectrecurred, most strongly on a set of white looks near the finale that achieved malleable stiffness and an otherworldly glow thanks to the aluminum shot through the fabrics. Also starring here was a pedal-to-the-metal judo suit. Crocheted face masks with sequined lips were de-sinisterized balaclavas, and the footwear, naturally, was all biker bootsalthough sometimes it featured high heels. Road signs were enlarged and broken up into the print used on one long, flowing coat worn tied around the waist by its sleevesand once the show was done, the bikers outside willfully ignored local traffic regulations and roared off en masse. One of them broke down, but that was the only glitch in this delightful little riot of a collection.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,A.L.C.,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 21, 2015\",\"August saw the announcement of big news for A.L.C. a long time in the works: a majority investor in the form of new kid on the block InterLuxe (Jason Wu marks their only other fashion interest to date). And still, despite this key development in the labels business, designer Andrea Lieberman has gone and turned out one of her most intensely personal collections to date. Inspired by a Berber textile she had picked up in her travels and stashed away in a box at her fathers home, she let a certain nomadic romanticism guide her hand for Spring, to an effect that was soulful and punk at the same time, as Lieberman dubbed it.\n",
      "A knack for winning and inventive distillations of the 70s and 90s has distinguished A.L.C. for a while now; here that came through in spades, without so much as a trace of the costumey (the most literal retro indulgences were a great studded jacket in whiskey-color suede and crocheted maxi numbers). Instead, Lieberman whipped up fantastic chevron knit gowns and strapless belted maxi dresses. \n",
      "The prints here also stood out as perhaps the labels strongest to date: quietly folky-looking pink and chocolate blooms on a black background, inspired by a henna-treated ceremonial veil; the fantastic, simple white tone-on-tone cotton jacquard influenced by a headdress and seen in a matching jacket and A-line skirt; and a muted yet lush-looking take on tie-dye. \n",
      "In discussing the lineup, Lieberman said she was particularly interested in creating a sense of restraint with these clothes. That was here, of course, and the spare elegance of A.L.C. continues to distinguish it from so many of its peers in the contemporary market; but what really spoke most clearly in this collection was a feeling of general, offhanded richness. It was plenty to whet your palate for the big developments in both retail and wholesale on the horizon for the brand.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,A.P.C.,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"They call me the king of basics, Jean Touitou said with a laugh at the APC presentation today. Kingliness is one thing, but the basics bit has lately proved irksome to Touitou. He decided to do something about it this season, starting by making a capsule offering of little black dresses. Its an item whose APC time has come. Past due, even. There are few things more essential to a French womans wardrobe than an LBD, after all. Touitou used black silk crepe, a first for him, he admitted, but he insisted the silhouettes remain quite simple, ensuring they stayed close to the spirit of the brand. A long tube dress was cut on the bias so it glided over the body without gripping it, and the excess material on a shorter one became a cape-like sash to wear loose behind the back or wrapped around the shoulders. A third one, cut on the grain and featuring a single leather shoulder strap, was a favorite of the editors passing through the companys Rue Madame headquarters. \n",
      "Amidst the boy-cut denim pieces, the overalls, the smocks, and the well-cut trench that rounded out the collection, the other news was a shoulder bag made from molded vegetable-dyed leather. It had a great saddlebag shape, but the novelty wasnt how it looked or what it felt like; it was in the fact that it will be available for sale right away, not months from now. Despite inroads by a few brands, fashion seems stubbornly resistant to the see now/buy now concept, and the missed opportunities just keep multiplying. Good on Touitou and team APC for figuring this project out.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,A.W.A.K.E.,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" October 21, 2015\",\"Natalia Alaverdian is a designer with a lot of ideas. Good ones. Her latest A.W.A.K.E. collection threaded references to her spirit animal for this season, the zebra, through a rich variety of motifs, ranging from dream-of-Africa aesthetics to ones cribbed from Vermeers Holland and 80s-era fashion from Japan, not to mention a dollop of 90s grungy-ness. Alaverdian hopped along from one association to another, racking them up on top of each other in a way redolent of those corporate brainstorm meetings where every notion, no matter how distant from the topic at hand, gets added nonjudgmentally to the dry-erase board.\n",
      "Alaverdian is at the point in her career as a designer where she should be able to refine her stew of ideas into an easily comprehensible proposition, rather than continuing to serve them up brainstorm-style. This collection was full of winning piecesfluid, duster-length trench coats; tops and jackets with sculptural pouf sleeves; checked pencil dresses; and skirts with muscular ruffles and bowsbut they were swamped by the surfeit of looks that featured complicated asymmetrics, or vast volumes that felt nonspecific. The motley print and pattern here, and the way Alaverdian layered them together, added to the sensory overload. Its not that Alaverdian needs to trim down her ideassome looks, like the A-line floral coat paired with a mid-calf seersucker skirt embellished with rosettes, got at all (or at any rate, most) of them with clarity and concision. When she applies real rigor to her hyper-associative design process, the charm of her aesthetic comes through.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ace & Jig,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 13, 2015\",\"Process has always been paramount to Ace & Jigs Jenna Wilson and Cary Vaughanin their own work, but also, as Spring tells it, in that of others. The pair were particularly fascinated with the German conceptual artist Wolfgang Laib, who worked heavily in natural materials, memorably gathering pollens of different consistencies and hue (dandelion, hazelnut, et al) and creating geometric shapes from them. Some of Springs myriad prints nodded to those forms, but there are plenty of inherent parallels to the duos process. The looms in India that their cotton gauzes are woven on are traditional and time-honored, a far cry from fashions heavily automated present.\n",
      "Textiles are always the real news for Ace & Jig, and Springs most winning developments included a graphic black-and-red stripe, pitch-perfect as a column gown, as well as nods to kente fabrics. Warmth has long been a distinguishing characteristic of Wilson and Vaughans clothingthat came through here in spades. Best of all was a stunning kimono with a hand-woven collar, created in collaboration with Los Angeles textile studio All Roads.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Acne Studios,Chioma Nnadi,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"A bohemian circle of muses have been in heavy rotation for the last couple of seasonsJoni Mitchell, Janis Joplin, and the likebut now it seems that things in fashion might be moving to a new musical beat. Acne Studios creative director Jonny Johansson is certainly keen on pressing the fast-forward button, and his latest collection vibrated with an energy that fell somewhere between 80s electro and 90s rave culture. Electric guitars made of chrome and plexiglass, which embellished the length of cropped trousers and boxy suiting, were the most obvious leitmotifs here. More convincing, though, were the eye-catching optical polka-dot prints that resembled the dilated pupils of euphoric ravers, on floor-length velvet and silk dresses that were fastened in the back with guitar-like strapsa cool take on the slip dressing trend.\n",
      "If one were to peg the collection to a stylish musical icon in particular, it would likely be Grace Jones. The radical 67-year-old Jamaican singer just published her memoirs, and has been inspiring a new generation of fans with her risk-taking sorry-not-sorry sense of style. Jones recently caused a stir at the Afropunk Festival in New York wearing one of her many elaborate costumes (it involved little more than a corset G-string body suit, and a Hula-Hoop that she kept spinning around her lithe torso). The blazers-cum-minidresses that Johansson paired with short-as-you-dare hot pants and statement asymmetric shades were a look that Jones could pull off to this day, though its doubtful who else could, besides superstar bad gals like Rihanna perhaps, who has been making headlines with her pantless ensembles all summer long.\n",
      "In some ways it felt as if part of the grounding street smart vibrations that first propelled Acne into the spotlight were lacking today; the cut and fit of their original oversized biker jackets and shearling coat is still hard to beat, after all. Still, warm-weather dressing isn't something that Nordic fashion folk have much time to experiment with. The discharge-print boy racer tees and charming checkerboard slip-on Moroccan slippers, on the other hand, are likely to be a hit with the first bloom of spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Adam Lippes,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Walking into Adam Lippess Washington Square apartment presentation is a rare Fashion Week treat. From the breakfast spread to his trio of standard poodles to this seasons piano player, you feel instantly at home. At the very least, you want to move in. \n",
      "Against this exceedingly pleasing backdrop, Lippes presented a fine new collection, one that solidified his reputation for effortless chic, but also found him developing new categories. Lippes said an audacious floral-print suit from his Fall collection had something to do with his Spring experiments. He figured its bold color and pattern would render it an outlier. On the contrary, its been a total sellout, and its success gave him the license he needed to try a glam white jumpsuit with an outer layer in hand-macramd silk cord. Its a feat of engineering and easily the sexiest thing hes done yet. A strapless black silk faille gown was more demure, but an equally convincing foray into high evening.\n",
      "Still, its his polished sportswear thats been helping him double his business each season, so the big emphasis here was on daywear. Pieces like a 16-ply cashmere sweatshirt accompanied by gold micro pliss pants as comfy as pjs, a washed denim apron dress thrown over an oversize poplin tee, and slouchy linen track pants teamed with a striped shirt, its elongated tails hanging loose in back. Lippess m.o. is refined, but not so much so that it compromises his clothes casual factor. Extra credit for the generously proportioned slip dresses in an Agnes Martininspired abstract print.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Adam Selman,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Ever the adventurer, Adam Selman will gleefully chart a course where others dare not go. Fall found him obsessed with Cookie Mueller, an oft-overlooked bad girl in John Waterss morally bankrupt coterie. This season Selman blew all the way to one of the smaller Hawaiian islands, where he discovered Taylor Camp, a 60s and 70s nudist colony on the oceanfront property of a witting Howard Taylor, shortly after his impossibly glamorous sister, Elizabeth, played her baddest role yet in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Selman is keenly aware that he has a fondness for foul-mouthed spitfires: Ill always have my bad girls, he chuckled backstage, beaming through his signature stache.\n",
      "Clothing isnt optional on a runway, so Selman snapped out of his beach-induced high, brushed off the sand, and set about crafting latter-day hippiewear with a focus on what he called nonchalant exposure. Joyful flower prints and appliqus on jaunty summer dresses bounded out to a cheery sing-along soundtrack. They were mixed with breezy denim separates, as well as white bandeaux and drawstring slacks, some of which were reversed to reveal seams and pockets. An erstwhile symbol of modesty, gauzy crinolines were stripped of their cumbersome shells and placed front and center, starting with the first exit. Converse All Stars were also reworked, DIY-style, to become platform espadrilles. However, a baby tee with an illustrated image of a woman smoking a blunt was obscured by a denim jacket by the time it hit the catwalk.\n",
      "This wasnt just a nod to pot-smoking, free-loving, skin-baring hippies, but also an ode to an authentic craftsy look, in particular the work of Todd Oldham, the designer perhaps best loved for so artfully cobbling things together on MTVs House of Style with Cindy Crawford. Unbeknownst to most, there he was in the audience today, happily yakking it up with more of Selmans bad girls, Amy Sedaris and Lea DeLaria (Orange Is the New Black). Its a tribute to me? asked Oldham after the show, in believable disbelief. He described how he and Selman had met while hanging wallpaper with Sedaris. Im in awe of Adam, he said. Hes the real deal.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,ADEAM,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Hanako Maeda has been busy rediscovering her Japanese roots. On a recent trip to Kyoto, she grew particularly enamored of her native countrys architecture. For Spring, she focused on marrying the aesthetic heritage of Japan with the lean sophistication of New York, her adopted hometown, just as East met West during the Edo period.\n",
      "Maedas clothes have never lacked in urbane appeal, so it was a particular treat to see how she incorporated traditional elements and pitted structure against fluidity. The past several seasons have witnessed the designer loosening up her once ladylike vernacular, and there was a downright languidness to these pieces.\n",
      "The kimono was of particular interest to Maeda, who borrowed traditional prints from those garments and elements of the obi that cropped up on a flowing wrap dress, or across the front of a long vest. Elsewhere, the knotted neckline on a gauzy maxi nodded to the process behind traditional shibori dyeing techniques, and the red, harness-like sash on a starry black-and-white gown (perhaps the strongest look in todays lineup) echoed the tasuki traditionally worn by Japanese drum players, among others. But you could hardly hope for a more fitting marriage of the modern-day and the traditional than Maedas raw indigo denim mini with a flowing underlay of shibori-printed chiffon.\n",
      "Despite the newfound ease to her clothes, Maeda remains as adroit as ever when it comes to evening: Her strapless, obi-inspired jacquard dress (look 29) was just the antidote to overwrought red carpet fare. Between day and night, these pieces added up to the labels strongest outing in recent memory. If Maeda has had a tendency in the past to change her course a bit from season to season, you hoped shed stay this one.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Adidas by Stella McCartney,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" October 22, 2015\",\"According to the folks at Adidas HQ, this seasons Adidas by Stella McCartney collection was inspired by athletes. Well . . . duh? Isnt this an activewear line? What McCartneys reflection on athletes and athleticism meant in practice was that this was a collection more focused on functionality than aestheticsthe updates mainly had to do with details of cut and fabrication that optimized the performance of the apparel. That was witnessed in the feathery weight of the running gear and elements such as compression bands, reflective strips, mesh inserts, and internal cooling dots placed at points on the body where the body generates the most heat. McCartneys zebra-print maillots were cut with an eye toward hydrodynamismthey also looked a good deal hipper than the standard-issue racing suitand her seamless knit onesie managed to hark back to Western yoga practices boho roots and deploy new textile technology in aid of peak flexibility. Women who are devotees of a particular sport will appreciate McCartneys care in seeing to their utilitarian needs; those who mainly aim to compete in the sport of fashion, meanwhile, will glom on to pieces such as the designers floral-print anorak and ergonomic black-and-white sandal, an excellent alternative come spring to the omnipresent Birk. Performance was the focus here, in other words, but there was more than one way this collection performed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Aganovich,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"This collection was an ode to Tiresias, a bird-communicating Greek soothsayer who blabbed divine secrets and was punished by being blinded then turned into a womanas whom she was both praised as a priestess and pilloried as a prostitute (depending on who you read)before eventually gender-reverting. Which is actually kind of now.\n",
      "The clothes themselves seemed more literal articulations of the 18th century (perhaps edging the cusp of the 19th) in terms of form: There were full-bodied frock coats with jauntily pointed tales, corsetry, an inclination toward ruffle-free yet jabot-like fullness at the neck, and a sense of tailoring pared back and made primitive. As an Aganovich virgin, to these eyes there also seemed a soft backdrop of Ackermann, Watanabe, and Westwood here: neither as debt nor derivation, just context. \n",
      "The collection was an ongoing argument between the tie (masculine trope) and the color pink (feminine trope). Both tropes were warped, abused, remixed, and blended. Batik-dyed linen was the outer layer against folded-back flashes of silk organza animal print, an inversion of hierarchy that saw the rougher fabric promoted to front of house with the snazzier pushed to the fringes. There were moments when the fumes pumping forth from the Viper smoke machine became a little too thick to see all the orchid undulations on offer or to appreciate the twists in the muted monochrome brocades. Yet there was clarity enough to appreciate this tightly packed meditation on wearable tumult.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Agnona,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"This was a poignant presentationyet not necessarily in the way that Agnonas producers intended. In the atrium a tree had been installed whose foliage was a mixture of desiccated leaves and dead butterflies. From its lifeless branches hung 16 looks that were two-thirds miniaturized in cashmere voile11 from the archive and five from the new collection. What they demonstrated was how rich the history of this mill, specializing in rare yarns and founded by Francesco Ilorini Mo in 1953, truly is. Balmain, Dior, Chanel, Cardin, Saint Laurent (when it was all about Yves)back in the day, Agnona cast all of these canonical designers sketches in wool. Agnona made brilliance real. \n",
      "Today? Well, its not awful. Agnona is never going to be a summer house, obviously. Still, there was a gorgeous suede wrap dress that, while completely divorced from the essence of this brand, was a thing of beauty and rightfully spotlighted center stage. Some impressive hand-painted pliss pants were worth an ogle. The brown leopard blouse was less moving, the foliage-print caftans were definitely wearable, but the safari jackets just served as piquant reminders of Saint Laurent. Agnona is owned by Ermenegildo Zegnaa titanic fashion house whose main business is the sartorial outfitting of men. The arrival of Stefano Pilati was heralded as a new dawn for the Agnona-Zegna womenswear dream team. That plan changed when Pilatis focus shifted to the wonderful Zegna Couture. In the meantime, Agnona has been left out in the colda book without an author. It deserves one.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Akris,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Akriss Albert Kriemler has long looked to architecture as a reference, but he made the relationship explicit for Spring, teaming up with the Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto to create fabrics. Fujimoto designed Londons Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in 2013. Kriemler was so moved by the matrix of white steel poles that he approached Fujimoto about working together. Backstage it was hard to tell who was more excited about the collaborationKriemler or Fujimoto. The architect sat in the front row; it was his first fashion show.\n",
      "Architecture is architecture and clothes are clothes. Bringing them together isnt always the smoothest project. Indeed, there were a few proposals here that read as too literal: A dress made from thin strips of cork to look like wood siding with a black mesh window at the hip, for example, was a little on the nose.\n",
      "The Forest of Music is a music hall project in Budapest with a molded round roof that has openings for trees to grow. The shirts and skirts it inspired were perhaps a tad eccentric for the Akris customer. Where the clients are concerned, the best pieces on the runway were the ones made from square slices of Perspex sealed between two layers of organza. The streamlined dresses glinted subtly; they wont require any backstory on the sales floor. On the other hand, if the Akris woman learns about Naoshima, the Japanese island filled end-to-end with art museums and site-specific installations, including Fujimotos faceted pavilion, then this Akris collection was a job well done.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alberta Ferretti,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"The backdrop of Alberta Ferrettis show was an aerial video of the desert: sand sliding over mile upon mile of dunes, nothing but sun, wind, and skyand just about as far away from Milans rain-soaked streets as you could get today. The wide-open vistas offered clues to Ferrettis frame of mind. The desert is free, theres movement, there are possibilities, she said backstage. I closed my eyes and we had many, many ideas. \n",
      "Nature is a theme that Fausto Puglisi would take up a few hours later, but where his version was rough around the edges, Ferrettis this season was bohemian. There was a bit of the festival girlCoachella by way of Burning Manto her pieced lace slip dresses and patchwork suede shifts in warm shades of brown and black. Ferretti has made a specialty of whisper-thin dresses over the years. Usually they have more of a red carpet orientation, but true to her word, here they came in breezy chiffons with fraying at the edges and as a decorative motif. Along with the lacy white cotton numbers, slightly Victorian in spirit, these were among the best pieces in the show, effortless and earthy, perched on corded gladiator sandals where some of the more elaborately worked and printed dresses, often with rough-hewn gold jewelry, came off heavy and overdone. \n",
      "A detour through some safari-influenced daywear captured that easy vibe, but they seemed rather beside the point. At Alberta Ferretti, the dress is always the thing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alessandra Rich,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"For Spring, Alessandra Rich unveiled an unabashedly feminine collection dubbed Dolores, after an invented South American heroine, one whose wardrobe for her romantic escapades is punctuated by expanses of lace; frilled, fluted hems; and large, poufy sleeves worn off the shoulder. The story is of a girl who runs away to get married, said Rich at an appointment off the Rue Saint-Honor, characteristically charming and wearing one of the gold heartaccented belts that accessorized the runway looks. Its probably a bad idea, but she does it anyway.\n",
      "And she does it in style: An excellent waist-whittling trenchcoat in silk moir was offered in three colorways (black, white, and fuchsia) and proved just the ticket for a dramatic escape from disapproving parents and friends. The wedding festivities would be celebrated in bow-topped tiers of fluffy white lace. She is definitely a girl in love, purred Rich, and it shows; party dresses came in pleated, cutout, off-the-shoulder lam or as a series of paillette-bedecked wiggle gowns with trumpet hems, while a number of silk rompers were deployed for their lingerie codas (one plunging cream tie-accented dress was very Bianca Jagger). But among all of the exuberance, it was the selection of seriously good denim (the use of the textile being a first for Rich) jackets, body-conscious dresses, and sleek jumpsuits that just might prove to outlast the honeymoon period. After all, as every girl knows, flash can be fun, but strong and steady often ends up winning the day.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexander Lewis,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"And then there was light. . . . Alexander Lewis isnt afraid of a religious reference, but he wasnt riffing on Genesis in his new, light-themed collection. Rather, on this occasion he took Richard Dawkinss tack, and regarded the science of light with a near-spiritual sense of awe. This season Lewis collaborated with the artist Flavie Audi, who makes sculptures of metal and glass, and he was fascinated by the way light plays on and within her work. That inspired a study of the properties of lightits wavelike form, the way it refracts through prisms, how its reflection glimmers and splits across the surface of things. It was a good season, in other words, for Lewis to have sponsorship from crystal honchos Swarovski.\n",
      "Lewis got at his theme via a variety of means. He made rubbings of Audis sculptures and developed cloud-like prints and patterned jacquards, and he peered into the insides of her work and watched the alchemy of her materials, then created galactic-looking prints that magnified those reactions. There were also crystal-dappled sheer silks, frequently found layered with other, more plainspoken materials such as shirting pinstripe, that recalled the reaction prints starry night sky effect. Elsewhere, Lewis conjured light waves via crystal strands dangling off a dress, or caviar crystal pressed into the fabric of a pale blue skirt. Blue was the key color here; this collection also emphasized dresses and skirts more than most Lewis outings. The collection was at its best, oddly, when Lewis interpreted his theme either extremely literally or extremely looselyhis pinstripe pieces were a highlight, for instance, but so was the sweater with a refracting prism intarsia-ed across the front, and a cropped top with mirror cube embroidery.\n",
      "The one quibble here, really, was with Lewiss insistence that all his garments express his concept, either more or less directly. In general, his sense of focus redounds to his benefit, but it would be nice to see this designer loosen up a little, and permit himself to, say, cut a sharp pair of trousers, or conjure a fluid, flattering dress, just because they complement the rest of his collection. Lewis gets his points across just finehe should have the confidence, going forward, not to underline them.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexander McQueen,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"The girls had pink-cheeked complexions and tousled hair flowing down their backsa bunch of young English roses who might have been caught by Julia Margaret Camerons camera lens in Victorian times. What they were dressed in were the prettiest and most personal designs that have come from Sarah Burton since she took over as creative director of Alexander McQueen. Gone were the face-obscuring headdresses and ironclad corsets; gone the hobbling platform shoes. I wanted it to be believable, touchable, soft, said Burton backstage.\n",
      "To an extent, the beautiful dresseswith their ruffles cascading across the body and falling off shoulders, the palette of pale pink, the flower-strewn patterns, the pristine cotton, the tattered lace, and the frock-coated tailoringspeak for themselves. Everything about them in these times when every camera phone has a zoom lens can be examined in all their extraordinary detail, down to the finest knitted stitches, the flower-painted wooden clogs, and the couture-level embroidery. On the other hand, for all that the ethereal lightness, whip-smart tailoring, and elaborate designs communicated a new, relaxed, of-the-season relevance, they also carried the story of a London history that Burton wanted to make known. \n",
      "She explained that shed been inspired by the 17th-century silk weavers of Spitalfields, members of the Huguenot Protestant faith who fled religious persecution in France and settled in Londons East End. I loved the stories of how they arrived with very little, bringing seeds and bulbs in their pockets to grow. They were gardeners. And they wove their French flowers into the patterns on their silks. \n",
      "Burtons choice of reference point was personalshe is a country girl with a real love of naturebut the resonances run deeper than her attraction to pretty flowers. Alexander McQueen traced part of his family bloodline back to some of the estimated 50,000 Huguenot refugees who were welcomed into Britain by the edict of King Charles II and became producers of high fashion silks for court finery and the great homes of England. McQueen was proud of that link to the first immigrants to bring luxury fashion to London, and he would surely approve of his former protge using this platform to point to the parallels with todays migrant crisis. \n",
      "There was one silk dress, covered with sprigs of flowers, that came somewhere in the middle of the collection and was a near replica of a 17th-century court dress Burton examined. How funny to imagine that this delightful, demure dress might have its own outing at the British court in the 21st century. Kate Middleton would look wonderful in it.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexander Wang,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Alexander Wang has always loved a bash, and for his 10th anniversary collection tonight he threw himself a big one. Up front, a merch table sold his DoSomething.org tees and sweats, which benefit the organizations youth and social change efforts. It was straight out of a rock show, a feeling that was accentuated inside the venue by the crush of celebrities who sat in the front row. Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Josh Ostrovsky (a.k.a. The Fat Jew), The Weeknd, Bella Hadid, Mary J. Blige . . . the list goes on. Post-show, a curtain at the back of the runway opened to reveal a phalanx of pole dancers, who entertained the throngs until it was time for the partys big numbers. Tinashe, Lil Wayne, and Ludacris all performed. But the nights main act was the video that played after the models took their finale spin. An extended highlights reel, it was a long, loud, chronological look back at Wangs first decade, from his early bows, short-haired and baby-faced at 21, all the way through last Novembers H&M collab and his Fall 15 advertising campaign. \n",
      "Its a critical moment for Wang. In July, he and Balenciaga opted not to renew their contract beyond its first three-year term. Such a short tenure at such a prestigious house could tarnish a designers reputation, but Wang has emerged essentially unscathed and, as he seemed to be saying with tonights hoopla, bigger than ever. \n",
      "When the split was announced, Wang suggested that he wanted to turn his focus to his eponymous brand. That meant expectations were elevated for this new collection. If some of the surrounding festivities (ahem, those pole dancers) were somewhat off-message, he nailed the collection, which was free of pretense. No concept, he said backstage, summing up the straight-off-the-streets ethos of the clothes. Were always asking ourselves whats modern. Well, whats modern is whats right in front of us. Thats an idea thats gained traction in the industry over the last couple of years, but it was Wangs own approach at the beginning. It worked for him then, and, save for a couple of costumey fringed leather pieces, it worked for him tonight with his deconstructed denim, army surplus separates, pajama silks, slip dresses, and one shrunken satin bomber jacket. Wang intuitively gets what the downtown cool girl wants to wear. Theres no disputing the New Yorkiness of his clothes, but no anniversary collection is complete without a throwback moment. Anybody still wondering what the AW510 insignia that turned up on an oversize hoodie and some of the mens pieces stands for? Wang, remember, hails from Northern California: 510 is the born-in-the-Bay-Area area code of his cellphone.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexandre Plokhov,Dan Thawley,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Few and far between are the menswear designers willing and able to transition into the womens market. In fact its a genuinely rare scenario that often builds in reverse, so when ex-Cloak designer Alexandre Plokhov tried his hand at a ladies line for Fall 2015, trusting devotees welcomed his evolution with open arms. Now that moody, almost all-black debut is hitting stores, the Eve to Plokhovs Adam has hit her stride for Springforegoing the darkly draped tendency of his first outing in favor of a crisp sensuality, where D-ring cinched belts, snap-buttoned patch pockets, and zipped lapels helped shape his utilitarian vision.\n",
      "Having tweaked a cropped tailoring silhouette and developed a wrapped, linear form to his apron dresses and boxy tunics, Plokhov accented this collection with a slew of subtly worked-on fabricsturning to washed leather, patchwork jersey, polka dots, and a shredded stripe jacquard that felt rich in hand against his flat cotton poplins. The latter material was frayed and box-pleated across shirtsleeves and buttoned A-line skirts, both of which appeared in a sunny shade of citrus yellow in his Paris showroom. Though edited out of these images, that optimistic shade joined the black, navy, and sand color lineup to further shake up the masculine tendencies of Plokhovs oeuvre, rendering his outsider label all the more relevant in a season rife with gender ambiguity.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexandre Vauthier,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"If you laid out the looks from Alexandre Vauthiers Fall haute couture collection alongside those he proposed for Spring ready-to-wear, youd very quickly have a stack of matching pairsright down to the shoes, produced by Sebastian. Of course, nothing would be identical; for ready-to-wear, Maison Lesage hand-embroidery became mechanical and the leather fringes now appeared in jersey. But the gist was there. Even Daria Strokus, who closed Vauthiers couture show, returned as his ready-to-wear leading lady (looking particularly femme fatale in the Oscar Niemeyerdesigned French Communist Party Headquarters).\n",
      "The temptation to declare dj vu lessens once you take the holistic view that a designer needs a top-notch testing ground to breed the best ideas (and for what its worth, Raf does the same over at Dior). Plus, Vauthier upholds his fixation with fitthe body-grazing blazers and body-con laced bias dresses revealed curves, not compromises. He took pride in showing how he turned an obscenely expensive lace-encrusted dress into a generally expensive lace-encrusted dress without a noticeable difference. And the opium red leather biker dress was basically a dead ringer. In fact, the biggest difference with Vauthiers ready-to-wear offering was the injection of filler pieces: sexy bodysuits, tailored vests, and an LBD that can be worn loose and poncho-style or sleekly belted.\n",
      "Within the past two weeks, Aubrey Plaza, Suki Waterhouse, and Vauthiers loyal patroness Carine have all furthered his red carpet visibility. But while this may be prime advertising, the introduction of a dressed-down linen grouping suggested its not his sole focus. Each of the piecesbe it a jumpsuit or a shirtdressreceived some sort of Vauthier golden touch. Maybe theyll prove the launchpad for his Spring couture.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alexis Mabille,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"In 2011 a food-supply scandal made the news in China when watermelon farmers who had sprayed their crops with a chemical product that promised rapid growth were dismayed to discover it served only to make their melons explode into worthless pulp. Earlier this month a minority stake in Alexis Mabille was sold to a 3,400-outlet Chinese fast-fashion outfit called Peacebird, which plans to roll out a network of Mabille stores in China.\n",
      "Mabille chose the watermelon as his motif for this, his first post-Peacebird ready-to-wear collection. There was a sequined watermelon on the front of a ruche-armed sweatshirt teamed with some jaunty shorts and a sheer half-skirt, watermelon print split-to-the-hip pants, watermelon bracelets, watermelon necklacesyou get the drift. More ambiently watermelon-touched were the dubious contra-color layered lace slip dressesin watermelon-esque tonesand satin separates. This collection was at its best when sans watermelon yet explosive of silhouette: The oversize biker jackets and skirts were easy and fun. There was also a sweet 80s-flavor jumpsuit with volumized arms and a tonal fold at the neck. Plus, Mabille slices a pretty fine jacket: The single vented (watermelon) red example with an interestingly projecting revere was proof of that. There was an emphasis on open-at-the-back shirtingperfectly fineand an insistence on miniature backpack fanny packskind of Philipp Plein.\n",
      "This was very much a locals show, packed to its marble rafters with Parisians breathily just-about tolerating (as only Parisians can) the abundance of their fellows. The new Peacebird aspect to Mabilles story lent it an edge, which the clothes unfortunately rather lacked. It also made you really hanker after a nice ripe slice of lovely, juicy watermelon: organic, ideally.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Alice + Olivia,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"I feel like baby number three sort of inspired the desert vibes, said Alice + Olivia designer Stacey Bendet, who is scheduled to give birth next Tuesday and still had the wherewithal to slip into a minidress and thigh-high platform boots for her presentation today. This pregnancy got me really thinking about the inner goddess of the woman, which led me somehow to the desert, she said.\n",
      "Of course, the aforementioned bump made traveling a good deal trickier. Bendet thus relied on the desert of her imagination, conjuring up images of Earth Mothers and boho babes frolicking among the dunes in hand-embroidered skirts, flouncy off-the-shoulder tops and gowns, and sun-baked neutrals. It helped, too, that she had a man on the ground. [Contemporary artist] Francesco Clemente is a good friend of mine and he kept texting me photos of desert butterflies and flowers, so that also helped to inspire the collection, said Bendet.\n",
      "Overall, this was a softer, more romantic outing for Alice + Olivia. Bendet worked with chiffons and ruffles in pale shades of nude, blush, and icy blue to create what she dubbed her goddess gowns. She also wanted to create dresses that could be worn during the day with flats, but would still be sufficiently special for evening. Bendet accomplished her goal in the patchwork lace dresses in black and faded ivory that swished delicately at the ankle. Meanwhile, a high-neck gown, hand-embroidered with flowers, was exactly the kind of thing one dreams of wearing to a Mexican wedding one day.\n",
      "While Alice + Olivia is still strongest in the eveningwear category, Bendet had plenty on offer for day, too. The designer introduced a line of couture denim into the collection this seasonflared jeans that had been hand-embroidered with flowers or laser-cut in a leaf pattern. I really wanted to focus on the return of the pant as a statement item, said Bendet, who also churned out embellished wide-leg gown pants. Every season the designer includes a capsule black-and-white collectionmixed in with the boho embroidery and soft hues, those pieces felt a little out of place this go-round. However, Bendet knows her customers well, and each season a portion of them unfailingly want black and white: Sometimes creative vision has to bow to good old-fashioned business sense.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Altuzarra,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"There are responsibilities laid before fashion designers like 32-year-old Joseph Altuzarra, the chief of which is the pressure to capture the times in the form of clothes. This season, one of the instincts which is being thrust to the fore is escapism, or at least a resistance to the troubling forces at work in the world. Altuzarras answer to that was a Spring collection he described in his studio as Very serene, about the beauty of materials which are close to nature, like linen, cotton and burlap; things which are not fussy, and meant to look wrinkled.\n",
      "The search for authentic emotion led him to research the Spanish side of his identitythe heritage of his fathers upbringing in the rugged Basque region of northern Spain, home to self-reliant mountain-dwelling and sea-faring people. On the other hand, Altuzarras own reality is very much attuned to a certain modern urban womans demands, or at least his interpretation of them: Its all very well yearning for the wild and free, but what does that look like when walking on the streets of New York?\n",
      "Altuzarras creative compromise could be read in the details: high-heeled espadrilles (partly made by a Spanish craftsman), braided jute shoulder straps on skimpy linen camisole dresses, and rope frogging on navy nautical blazers and jumpsuits. He had worked hard on injecting a sense of the handmade into his textiles, with lots of pleating derivedat some distancefrom folkloric costume; hand-painted prints in greens, blues, and sunrise orange; and some beautiful micro beaded embroideries on broderie anglaise at the end.\n",
      "It made for a collection which was at its most appealing in the hand and on a rail, where the minutiae and the weightlessness of the fabricsand their rare luxurious qualitiescould be felt. One could also see Altuzarras pragmatic understanding of clothes that can perform in the midst of urban heat (as well as the close-up chic of such things as the tan leather saddle-stitched clip-on earrings).\n",
      "On the runway, though, the presentation somehow lacked the sense of joie de vivre women look for in summer, even in baking cities, and on their way to work. Maybe that had to do with Altuzarras choice of uniformly ultra-slim models, whose unsmiling neutrality failed to bring his stated aim of carefree believably to life. Whether its summer, winter, or anything in between, Altuzarra's work, with its man-attracting slit skirts and dresses, would look a whole lot sexier on a knowing womans curves. Customers would see that in a changing room, doubtless, but it would be a healthy, humanizing step forward if Altuzarra could bring himself to show it on the runway too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,And Re Walker,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Designers often use music as an inspiration. This season, Andre Walkers collection riffed on a single song: Althea & Donnas 1977 reggae classic, Uptown Top Ranking. At an appointment this afternoon, Walker said hed always wanted to do a thesis on that tracka really, truly terrific one, if youve never heard itand explained that hed dug into its lyrics to further his brainstorming. Dem check sey we hipWalkers check came in linen, and looked plenty hip in garments such as his short-sleeved tailored jacket, with its folded-under blurred hem. See me in a halter back . . . give you a heart attackWalkers funnel-neck halter-tops were sui generis, in particular coming in a cotton print of head sculptures by his friend and frequent collaborator Sylvie Auvray. He did his own versions of the songs khaki suit, too, albeit in dove gray.\n",
      "Walkers (admittedly casual) research extended beyond the lyrics of Uptown Top Ranking. He also asked his parents what had been going on in Kingston, Jamaica, around the time the track was recorded. They told him that denizens of the uptown area of the city had marked off their territory as a posh one, and taken to natty dressing to suit the attitude. One of the charms of Walkers collection was that it got at that nattinessnote his pencil skirts, cape-shouldered jacket tops, and precise tailored dresses, with their cutout sideswhile simultaneously summoning the chillaxed vibe of the song that had inspired him. Mesh-like pointelle knits and a generous helping of fishnet provided the collection with some breeziness, both literally and figuratively, while skirts cut to suggest the look of shorts or slouchy trousers introduced another kind of casual mien. Much of Walkers focus here was on fuzzing the hard edges of his silhouettes, as witnessed in that blurred hem jacket, for instance, but also in standout garments like his layered gray eyelet and white fishnet pencil skirt, and a cropped jacket with soft vertical pleats in the front. Perhaps that instinct to soften was another tribute to Althea & Donnaafter all, the most famous lyrics in their one big hit go, Love is all I bring. And this collection certainly felt open-hearted.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Andrew Gn,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"As the lights dimmed to signal the start of Andrew Gns show, an omniscient, accented voice gravely announced that the designer had just undergone unexpected surgery for a heart condition. Despite a promising recovery, he could not be present. Andrew has worked on this collection until the last moment, with all his passion and determination, the voice continued. He hopes you will like it. Leaving barely a minute to process Gns life-threatening episode, the pulsing music began and the show went on, beginning with dynamic daywear inspired by getaways to the north of France and ending with sumptuously embellished gowns based on a Chinese imperial porcelain bowl Gn inherited from his parents. \n",
      "Delineating the collection into two seemingly disparate parts confirmed that Gn is creatively ambidextrous, and clearly enjoys the freedom to propose sharp and soft in a single offering. The latter resituated the butterflies and peonies from his family heirloom against vibrant backgrounds, like a Pop Art homage to chinoiserie. While the butterflies were as detailed as any of the specimens on display at Deyrolle, the embroideries and multicolored stones turned pretty dresses into collector pieces. Waxing rhapsodic about surface treatments feels strange given the circumstances. Fashion may course through Gns veinshed sooner be inspired by the idea of a vacation than take onebut health comes before all else. So Andrew, we wish you a smooth and speedy recovery. And rest assured, we liked it.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Angelos Bratis,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Give Angelos Bratis the plainest piece of fabric and in no time itll be transformed into a draped wonder. He is an intuitive dressmaker: Hes adamant about not being called a designer. No sketches or mood boards for himjust thoughtful consideration of body shape. Working on this collection was a sort of therapy for me, said Bratis during a walk-through held in a light-filled, hypermodern space where models where standing in front of a maze of mirrors that reflected the surrounding forest of skyscrapers, part of a newly built Milanese architectural landscape. \n",
      "Bratis retreated to his native Greek village in the mountains near Athens to put together a lineup of beautiful dresses with the help of his mother. She is a great seamstressshe taught me everything! he said, pointing out liquid bias-cut polka-dot numbers cut from a single piece of silk, with decorative smock motifs hand-sewn with contrasting thread. I was thinking about the myth of Ariadne; my Greek heritage comes up in the most unexpected ways through memories, images, dreams. I love geometry, arithmetic, the mathematics of dance, the logic game of music and rhythm. But there is nothing conceptual about Bratiss creative process: Hes a sensualist, and his dresses reveal love and respect for the female body. Their shapes had a free flow; they were cut in fluid, languid fabrics and built with sophisticated draping effects, their asymmetric hems skimming the body and giving way to a soft, undulating movement. Not surprisingly, Aegean blue was the color of choice, an homage to Bratiss homeland that was also expressed in the melancholic melodies played by the harpist Vanja Contu, clad in one of Bratiss elegant kaftans.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ann Demeulemeester,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"On heels so soaring that the average height of these looks was within a whisper of six and a half feet, this Ann Demeulemeester collection trod pointedly around themes of personal expression, recreational repression, and commercial concession. The topstitched paneled black tailoring of which the facades veered from biker to tuxedo, the painstakingly ruched black leather pants, and the backless black tank topsslash-waistcoats with a melee of obi-belt knotting at the navel were all no-brainer ticks on a buyers list. The Demeulemeester codes factor in waft and sheerness, so more ticksalthough perhaps applied a touch less firmlyat the lightly fitted, transparent racer-back silk dresses, sometimes metallically agleam, and long jackets in softly acid, blurrily animal greens and yellows.\n",
      "Artistic director Sebastien Meunier said the collection was titled Rising and that his starting point was the angular unreality of Alberto Giacometti, then added: It is about the extreme elegance of women; how tall, how bright, how mysterious they can be. I pushed them in a super-elegant, kinky, sadomasochist form. This explained the choker-topped harnesses that were sometimes effectivewho knew a white harness under black suiting complemented by white sunglasses could be an uncreepily powerful accessory arsenal? Yet S&M motifs speak of subjugationalbeit consensualas well as power and so seem only queasily reconcilable with the runway. The oily chartreuse feathering on sleeves and coral-like clusters of quills were here thanks to Meuniers collaboration on this collection with artist Kate MccGwire. The quilled pieces were simultaneously beautiful and sad, organic reductions into abstraction for the sake of it. This lineup lacked the uplift that Meuniers last menswear outing seemed to augur. Yet for those who enjoy pain, this was not a pleasure to watchbecause it was fine.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Anna Sui,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"The penultimate day of the New York show sprint and who among us isnt in need of a visit to some far-flung, beachy locale? Thats just what Anna Sui served up tonight, albeit only a stones throw from the fracas of an assembled many awaiting another iconoclast (the lady Madge) over at Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "Prompted by a recent getaway of her own to Tahiti and Honolulu, Sui riffed on pops long-standing affair with island life, from the 30s starlet Dorothy Lamour, to Elviss trinity of Hawaiian movies, to David Baileys shot of a bronzed, sun-soaked Marie Helvin. Even Jane Campions high-minded New Zealand period piece The Piano made the cut in the form of a little subtly placed Victoriana.\n",
      "Suis tendency toward an almost magpie-like archivists eye remains one of her more defining and compelling characteristics. In addition to the above references, she looked at sailors valentines (the intricate seashell artworks), and even lifted a phrase from the 1941 Gary Cooper vehicle Ball of Fire: killer diller, the choice slang of Barbara Stanwycks lippy nightclub performer, Sugarpuss OShea, came embroidered across the back of a top.\n",
      "Indeed, todays Honolulu honeys embodied all the best parts of kitsch: its color, its humor, its play. Bowling shirts and souvenir jackets came to new life in Suis hands; the latter enjoyed a major revival last season, but even if they were downright du monde, youd be hard-pressed to argue with Suis take, lushly beaded with lurid-looking sunsets and pinup mermaids. Elsewhere was a dreamy marabou-trimmed peignoir that seemed to have dropped straight out of a Bunny Yeager snap and onto the palm treedotted catwalk. It all made for a deliciously heightened version of the tourist tat of another era.\n",
      "And what of the prints? Sui enlisted the fabled Zandra Rhodes to create a custom pattern, a delightful seashell number (Gigi Hadid very memorably donned a scarlet sarong in it). One Lurex-drenched, undersea chiffonwith angel fishes and allwas a real winner. Sui also sent out an octopus intarsia, and board shorts crafted from a heady-looking butterfly lace. \n",
      "Even as fashion continues to ride high on a wave of heavy minimalism (though a sea change is surely in the works), Sui is a designer who serves as a vivid testimony to the power of well-deployed profusion.

In one, there was water, in the other, sake. Both clear liquids, entirely alike in all properties except the important ones. Really, you see,its all in how you look at things. Until, of course, it isnt.\n",
      "Wireless headsets and elaborate instructions had been left on the seats: The Springcollection, one quickly gathered via the pamphlet and theEnglish robotic voice provided by the accompanying recording (think Benedict Cumberbatch meets Siri), was inspired by reflection, specifically how it warps reality. The clothes would only be fully visible through an iPhones camera app after being photographed with a flasha very modern take on a mirror, its true, but considering the plethora of devices held aloft during Fashion Week, not exactly a stretch.\n",
      "When the clothes appeared and were drowned in a flurry of handheld flashes, what first appeared to be a plain light gray or black-and-white striped dress became a neon houndstooth check; a glen plaid transformed into a tartan, a fancy tweed, a patchwork; pinstripes were lace; white became a kaleidoscope pattern; Mt. Fuji, a quilt. A speckled-looking frilledblack frock suddenly boasted the galaxy at warp speed, courtesy of what the show notes described as an official collaboration with the filmStar Wars (which, if true, should provide at least one of the upcomingfilms young stars with a seriously viable red carpet ensemble for an upcoming Comic-Con). Often the garments themselves were reversed, inverted, rejiggered: two pieces sewn together at the hemisphere to make a slightly off-kilter asymmetrical form, which came out a lot more appealingly than it sounds, especially in the case of the cropped bomber jackets; rounded sleeve sheaths; and short, A-line shifts.\n",
      "One has come to expect this level of technological trickery from designerKunihiko Morinaga, who has played with the ideas of exposure, light, and shadow before. But here, his fabric innovationsdeveloped in collaboration with a company that specializes in recursive reflective paint, the type used in markers and signs at construction sitescame with a smattering of actually wearable shapes, a combination that promises to move beyond the purely conceptual and into actual closets. (Plus, it must be said: What a good party trick!)\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Anthony Vaccarello,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"For a Spring season, theres been remarkably little heat on the runway. Its been one more or less sexless show after another, then along comes Anthony Vaccarello.  The Belgian-Italian designer, as his fans and his detractors like to say, never met a slit he didnt like, and in typical fashion this show was full of them. But there were also other things happening, new things that made this outing feel like Vaccarellos most diverse to date. Take, for instance, the T-shirt and tank dresses printed with a closeup of his friend and muse Anja Rubiks face. As they approached, it became clear that the dresses werent printed at all, but rather embellished with gradient clusters of studs depicting photographer Collier Schorrs portrait of the unmistakable model. Just think of the Instagram possibilities.\n",
      "Also novel: Tattoo prints on crisp white cotton button-downs. Vaccarello has a distinct point of view, and, until now, there hasnt been much room in it for such decorative motifs. But now that hes up and running at Versus Versacehe took his first solo bow there a week and a half agohes clearly set his mind to expanding the world of AV. To that end, he made a big push into denim, the entry-level price-point item that can really goose a brands bottom line. High-waisted styles, one accessorized with a denim belt that grazed the rib cage, will be about as forgiving as his hip-high slits, but there were loose-fitting boyfriend jeans in the mix that will appeal to a broader swath of body types. \n",
      "Vaccarello also put his first bags on the runway. The gold detailing on a pair of cross-body styles echoed the hardware that accented this collections strong military-influenced tailoring and its drapey jersey numbers. Binx Walton, fashions tomboy du jour, looked terrific in the one-shoulder, asymmetric-skirt bathing suit dress. Best in show, however, goes to Edie Campbells fitted officers jacket and sexy black jeans.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Antonio Berardi,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Antonio Berardis stated theme for Spring was distressed glamour. He got at it best at his show this morning via his use of transparency and his lacing and fringe. The strongest look, by far, was a knit dress with a leotard-like top and a full skirt in a cobweb weave; it was a bit of a shame he didnt explore that idea further. But there were other similar, nearly as nice touches, such as the pieces composed in part of a knit done out of shiny, filament-fine yarn or window-paned in sheer chiffon. Meanwhile, the most focused part of this collection were the looks in black crepe that featured skin-winking lacing that spilled out in fringe.\n",
      "Much of the action here was going on in the back of these looks. Many of Berardis diaphanous dresses and skirts came with long trains, and a number of jackets tailored through the front opened up in back in soft pleats. There were also evening coats with internal crystal straps that allowed the coats to be slung off the shoulders like a backpack, a design nicked from activewear. That wasnt a bad idea, but it was one of several in this show that didnt seem fully thought through, certainly not in relation to the collection as a whole. Berardis intention throughout seemed to be to mix baroque formality with undone-looking or off-kilter shapes. There was an appealing collection hiding somewhere inside this busy outing, but overall it suffered from a too much of muchness.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Antonio Marras,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"After pausing to give his wife, Patrizia, a fervently Italian squeeze (youd get slapped for that anywhere else), Antonio Marras contemplated his board and said: I start with the simple lines and the simple shapes. But in the end I think normality is too boring. I prefer eccentricity. As do the Marras-ophiles who flocked backstage after this well-received show. You can see why. Season in, season out, he delivers variations on a template, though with Marras, sameness is a virtue that reflects a depth of imagination, not its absence. His vision is dense, delightful, and particular to him.\n",
      "The Spring 16 collection was touched by the work of the state-imprisoned Soviet-era Armenian director Sergei Parajanov. The fruit left on the front row was a nod to Parajanovs 1969 film, The Color of Pomegranates; the broken-plate print on the first three looks reflected his work, while the richly dun palette, ornamented headpieces, and occasionally literal swerves into a broad-belted, full-skirted, folk-dress silhouette nodded to the culture Parajanov was persecuted for propagating. As was a carpet-backed set of 14 Styrofoam boulders twined to the ceiling, two of which were mysteriously elevated for a rush-to-the-cameras finale of models in refashioned vintage white shirts and dresses studded with stones and layered with embroidery.\n",
      "The mass of the collection was Marrass signature dervish concatenation of tiered apron dresses, full skirts, wide pants, and frock-coats splattered with broderie anglaise, embroidered patchwork, printed panels, beading, tweed, and sequined appliqus. There was a lovely fil coupe stamped with plated-print circles of tarnished gold, silver, and bronze. The shoes ran a gamut from fabulous wood-soled platform sandals to bullet-toed embellished sneakers. With very few exceptions, this was a collection that looked easy to wear but was hard not to stare at. As Marras put it: I like a lot of things, together.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Anya Hindmarch,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"Anya Hindmarch likes to pack her shows full of very English fun and games: She has been known to build magic teacup rides into her runways, and once bussed in a full chorus of male choir singers dressed as road workers for her traffic-themed presentation. Hindmarchs fondness for all things British led her to the high street this season, and she incorporated the branding of some of the U.K.s best-loved stores into her tongue-in-cheek designs.\n",
      "If you grew up in London in the 80s, you might have recognized the saying emblazoned across a tote bag that read Never Knowingly Undersold as the tagline for the famed department store John Lewis. A pair of leather knee-highs was cleverly stamped with the logo for Boots, Englands answer to Duane Reade. Hindmarch showed that those cultural witticisms could be used in subtler ways, too, and the letters WHS (short for WHSmith, the popular British newsagent and stationery store) were repeated in a cool graphic pattern, which made for an unexpected take on logomania. \n",
      "The humor in those everyday references will likely be lost on Anya Hindmarch fans outside of British borders, though. Still, the designer didnt lose the smiley faces from her handbags altogether. The bite-sized additions to the collection, like mini soda-can key ring purses, will surely tickle the fancy of accessories fanatics the world over.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Apiece Apart,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"When Apiece Apart launched in 2008, its organizing principle was modularity. Designers Laura Cramer and Starr Hout wanted all their clothes to mix and match togethernot just within collections, but between seasons and over the years. What those modular clothes lacked in romance they more than made up for in durability: Longtime Apiece Apart fans will attest that they still wear looks from the earliest collections.\n",
      "Modularity is no longer the organizing principle of the label. Cramer and Hout have loosened the reins on their concept over the years, making clothes that are versatile and un-faddish but that impart some emotional resonance. They hit a sweet spot this season, drawing on Luis Barragns emotional architecture for inspiration. Cramer and Hout have long hewed to the look of Mexico and the Southwest, and the elements of those aesthetics that they drew on here fit organically into the established Apiece Apart vernacular. The tonal embroidery and hand-crochet in this collection was new for the brand, but it didnt feel that way. The designers also worked in proven silhouettes, giving them just a touch of an updatethe easy dresses that could be cinched or worn loose continued an idea they debuted for Resort, while the ruffled crop tops made for a flirty reiteration of one of their most popular shapes.\n",
      "The real development was in the knits. Alongside the excellent fine-cotton ribsanother continuation from Resortwere sweaters with lacelike texture and engineered knit pieces emblazoned with graphic stripes. The engineered knit tube skirt and matching ruffled bandeau was a look with terrific pop, and it made for a nice counterpoint to the gauziness of the collection overall. Even the punchiest items still read as staples that would wear well over the yearsyou could even see them paired with pieces from the Apiece Apart debut.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Aquilano.Rimondi,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"With the exception of committing factual error to publication, the hollowest feeling a fashion critic can experience is the sensation of tacking against the wind of consensus. For, at its essence, fashion is a tautly wrought tumbleweed of aesthetic agreement.\n",
      "So if everyone says A when you feel B about C, does that make you a Z? And, like, OMG? This Aquilano.Rimondi collection prompted a mild shiver of that unlovely sensation. Good luck with that, said one powerful tastemaker as we bundled toward the door after this show. Last-chance saloon, summated another as we bundled preshow toward it. Yet the most damning thing these eyes observed about this collection was the odd flash of meh.\n",
      "The idea of wearing paillette miniskirts as oomphed-up belts over long-yolked menswear shirts wasnt deeply flatteringthe tip of the yolk dangled unfortunately. The shirts themselves, though, were excellent, especially an endearing short-sleeved one with proper dress shirt cuffs. There were some interesting takes on the nightie/sleep slip as outwear. ARs versions were scalpel sliced, and when there came ruffle, it was applied with a more censoriously resistant eye to abandon than most designers have succumbed to this season: minimal romantic. The transliteration of Warhol florals to paillette reliefs was efficiently OK. And the X-ray white organza jacket that revealed the skeleton of its tailoring was strong, yet even better when fully opaque and black. AR seems to be languishing under a reputational cloud, but this collectionwhile no life changersignaled shafts of sunlight.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Area,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"It may be the labels first season with a slot on the New York Fashion Week show roster, but Area sure knows how to make an entrance. The brainchild of Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk, today the brand took over an airy room at The Standard and set their vision to life with an uncanny 70s beauty ad writ large.\n",
      "Makeup was, in fact, Springs prcis, as seen through the lens of some kind of gauzy, disco daydream. Doe-eyed, faintly dazed-looking models milled around vanity tables; silk dresses came encrusted with smudges of silvery glitter and glossy nude foundation smears, and baroque slippers with Perspex heels were . . . just plainly beautiful. Glitter or no, chromes got to shine too, so the designers whipped up the blush tire-rim print seen on a textured cream trench. Elsewhere they proposed plunging, wrap-front minis and lithe maxi dresses befitting Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface: one of the iridescent mesh gowns would look great on the red carpet.\n",
      "The spare clothes that Fogg and Panszczyk (alums of Calvin Klein Collection and Emanuel Ungaro, respectively) create, and the Braille-like embossing that has been their signature since the brands 2013 inception, resulted in a generally sporty, lean aesthetic. But this outing was one that showed a new dimension. Opening Ceremony was an early retail coup for the brand: After today, other tastemakers are sure to follow suit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Arthur Arbesser,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 28, 2015\",\"Its been a big week for Arthur Arbesser, one of Milans new generation of designers. Last Friday, he presented his first collection for the Italian sportswear company Iceberg, and today, an hour before his longtime former employer Giorgio Armani put on his own show, Arbesser took his young eponymous brand to the runway for the first time. There was already a sense of occasion. It was a fact Arbesser opted to accentuate by recruiting his friend, the composer and musician Jordan Hunt, to play live music, and by installing in the middle of the room a giant Balthus cat and a young woman who played the artists model on a low velvet chair.\n",
      "Balthuss favorite subjects were adolescent girls, and Arbesser used the famous painters oeuvre as a framework. The models hair was scraped carelessly to the side with bobby pins, and they wore white anklets with both their patent slingbacks and their Nikes. The pubescent edge-of-innocence thing can go dreadfully wrong. Its a tribute to Arbessers sensitive spirit, and that of his collaborators, that it didnt. At 33, hes fairly youthful himself; he gets how young women want to dress. A paper-thin technical nylon coat and matching pants brought a sleek, athletic edge to the collection that felt genuine. But the stars were illustrator Agathe Singers lovely prints. If the naive cat motif on a pair of overalls and a raincoat wont be for everyone, the lively floral that appeared on a flirty little dress, a pantsuit, and a long-sleeved T-shirt gown will find admirers well past their teenage years. This writer can attest to that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ashish,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"The pile of sequins scattered haphazardly atop a bench caught Ashish Guptas eye as he and his team were in the studio doing research: I thought they just looked beautiful, the designer said. So, he thought, why try and impose order when disorder looks so great? Thus this Ashish collection memorably preambled with a group of girls who skated the runway variously wearing DIY-touched tracksuits, a slip skirt, a frayed and washed denim T-shirt, and lairy-fairy dresses wreathed in tulle. Like nigh on every look in his Spring 2016, theirs were speckled and heaped with Ashishs random-on-purpose drifts of candy-tone sparkle. They also emanated a pleasing Larry Clarkish truculenceattitude, basically.\n",
      "Then the show-run started in earnest with another ka-boom. On the left was Larry B, the London DJ; on the right was Jay Boogie; the man in Look 2 is Maximillian. The crowd whooped even harder. When they got to the end of the runway, they initiated what became another walk-the-floor flourish that ran through the show by tossing handfuls of sequins at the crowd. Later Larry came out again in a spaghetti-strap slip illustrated with some pertinent details. Ashish explained: I always want my shows to be a celebration of subcultures. And I felt that Larrys dress was an important statement in the context of Caitlyn Jenner, but also racial issues, too.\n",
      "This was a show in which the overwhelming message was its rejection of categories through inclusion: Because were all just little sparkles, jumbled together. There were some striking outfits in here, toothe one-piece hybrids of sari and jeans, most lovablybut that message was the thing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ashley Williams,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"Its all well and good to talk about the 70s, 80s, and 90s, but theres a generation of young designers who were raised on Y2K values. The trashy, moody bad girls of the turn of the millennium loomed large in Ashley Williamss imagination for Spring, a motley crew of fictional and real-life characters that started with Emily the Strange and ended with Avril Lavigne. \n",
      "The 27-year-old designer has a soft spot for a skaters wardrobeher boyfriend, Palace Skateboards founder Lev Tanju, sat in the front rowalthough this season the vibe was more Camden Market goth does Black Swan, and PVC trenchcoats came emblazoned with a tag that read Ashley Williams Ballet School and were worn with black tutus, demented tiaras, and fishnet tights.\n",
      "That unapologetically brazen attitude also speaks to the aesthetic of a certain stylish bad gal of our times, and you can imagine Rihanna strutting her stuff in one of Williamss No Code of Conduct tees or in her slip dress printed with flies and laced up in neon straps. After an age of buttoned-up minimalism, its an exuberant and cheeky sexiness that cool young girls can relate to right now. The striped and pointy elf hats, though, are perhaps a tad too bad to be good.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Assembly New York,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Greg Armas usually has a self-described meta backstory when it comes to his collections. This time, he focused on bringing back the wardrobes of disappeared heroines. I started finding that a lot of interesting academic psychic, explorer, and adventurous avatar-type of individuals seem to disappear, said Armas. The classic examples were Amelia Earhart and Maria Orsic. A hefty narrative, which of course raises the question: What would the mysteriously vanished duo wear? Their closets were surprisingly pared back. Armas reimagined Earharts look the day she disappeared as a slouchy white jumpsuit and a trenchcoat with an oversize collar. More utilitarian and aviator influences were referenced in loose cotton trousers and a paisley bomber jacket.\n",
      "As for Orsic, a stunning German medium who performed sances during World War II and eventually disappeared in 1945, her hypnotic staples included a romantic crepe twist top with naval-skimming dcolletage and cascading shorts, as well as a slinky red silk maxi dress.\n",
      "When it came to Armass use of denim, the personal styles of the two women merged more closely. Think indigo denim overalls for Earhart and a set of optic white wide-leg denim trousers for Orsic; a loose chambray shirtdress, meanwhile, could have been worn by either muse. There was also a pair of jeans patchworked with vintage squares of varying washes, each hailing from a different decadea piece that could work for any woman with a modern-day-daredevil sartorial flair.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"For Tony Melillo, it all goes back to the T-shirt. He started his line, ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo, just under four years ago with a tightly edited range of tees, tanks, and sweats in neutral shades of white and black. While his business has since grown to reach every corner of the modern girls wardrobe, from leather joggers to work-ready suits, the concept of the perfect T-shirt is still the heart of the brand. Shoppers who discover ATM at department stores like Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue collect the drapey Modal tees by the armful, and this season Melillo introduced the Schoolboy tee, a boxy, slightly androgynous cut that lends itself perfectly to high-rise jeans. But even Melillos more high-concept pieces are designed with the T-shirt in mind: A shimmering charcoal parka in his Spring lineup was actually made of coated jersey, so the slick, high-shine exterior had a soft, familiar interior. Similarly, ATMs sharp suits were constructed from textured woven fabrics instead of stiff wool, and they were paired withwhat else?T-shirts, not blouses. Relaxed elegance is how Melillo described his point of view: It was easy for us to go into all these categories [after starting with T-shirts], as crazy as it may seem. We just stayed true to the brand identity. \n",
      "As such, Melillos collections are more about luxurious, wearable clothes than specific references. But Spring was loosely based on the art of travel: People always say ATM is perfect for traveling, so I was thinking about what a chic traveler would wear, he said. That isnt to suggest you should hit the airport in heels; rather, Melillos ribbed-knit sweatpants would look sleek, not sloppy, with white sneakers and, say, one of his neoprene blazers, which would bounce back after being stuffed into your carry-on. Of course, his supersoft tees, which are manufactured in Peru, are perfect not only for planes, trains, and automobiles, but for every aspect of your daily life, too, which is certainly a sweet spot to be in.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Au Jour Le Jour,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"It was extra-unfortunate that the branding of Dashthe Italian detergent that Au Jour Le Jour signed a deal with to sponsor this show, and whose logos were incorporated into the collectionwas so deeply reminiscent of Fresh, the new fragrance launched at Moschino on Thursday. Moschino has long been the don of ironic, Pop Art appropriation of mass-branding into high fashion, and although the AJLJ efforts to service its sponsors (logoed boots, a finely produced knit miniskirt and shirt, and some spangly slip dresses) were cute, the advertorial nature of the exercise undermined it. The point of Moschino, for house founder Franco and current designer Jeremy Scott, presumably was and is designing clothes to say something, not just get paid.\n",
      "Still, the collection was lively. The schtick, consistent with the sponsor (Dash!) was stains. So sequined jeans, vests, and black suede boots appeared splattered by scarlet ketchup. An opening section of sixties-eque mock croc color-blocked tartan suits and shifts worn over organza shirts were prettily polluted by more sequin stains of coffee and blood. Splodges were turned into camouflage, oozing contra-colored gloop ran down in panels on more colored faux croc and enamel stains were dripped onto paillette minis. As street style fare this was good fun, but the biggest stain in a collection full of them was that overly articulated commercial transaction.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Audra,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 14, 2015\",\"Audra Danielle Noyes is a young designer, having made her way nearly straight from her studies at Savannah College of Art and Design to Paris, where she cut her teeth at Lanvin and John Galliano. And so her Spring prcis was one no doubt informed by her own experiences, which delved deeply into the metamorphosis of a young woman. That idea came to life specifically in the notion of searching for freedom within control. An airy striped cotton silk jacquard, she explained at a preview, nodded to the strings of a marionette; a peplumed top with a cutout toyed with the idea of vulnerability. At times that reference felt slightly labored; you didnt need multilayered conceits to appreciate Noyess winning marriage of American sportswear and demi-couture sensibilities. To wit: a delicate trench in nude and blush with a full skirt, or a grouping made up of panels of various shapes, shades, and opacity. The latter were some of the collections loveliest pieces. \n",
      "With their generous volumes and polished brand of eccentricity, Noyess clothes are sure to find fans among women who arent afraid of a flounce or a bold sleeve. But that sensibility also gave way to plenty of versatile styles to round out the collection. The designer has a real talent for feminine riffs on suiting. Look no further than her windowpane cropped flares and slouchy blazer for evidence of that. Shirting likewise was an emphasis; tailored poplin pieces served as a counterpart to Noyess balloon-sleeved shifts and sculptural skirts. There was a certain innocence heresome of it intentional and some, you imagined, a by-product of the newness of the line that made you keen to see whats next for Audra.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Awaveawake,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 14, 2015\",\"Bali or bust! Awaveawakes Spring 16 collection served as a lush testament to time spent on the Indonesian island. Designer Jaclyn Hodes didnt lose sight of her m.o. of organically luxe styles or allow the trip to set her adrift on a sea of the tangential. Instead, like last seasons Jaipur-hued outing, it served as a lens through which to subtly reinterpret all the things that have earned her label its following: the languid, bias-cut slip dresses and the tops and skirts made for layering (informed by Hodess work as a stylist).\n",
      "There was plenty of lightness to be had here. The substantial-feeling lushness of washed silk charmeuse has long been a hallmark of Awaveawake, but in the interest of retail in the warmer months, Hodes diffused her signature material with styles in easy-to-wear, easy-to-care-for cotton. Elsewhere, Falls hardy cowl-neck sweatshirt came to feminine new life in a floral lace. The designers clothes have an undeniably earthy, even holistic quality to them, but with sophistication to spare. To wit: Springs apron dress, with its lithe, body-skimming shape and plunging back. With pieces like that, shell make a sensualist out of every one of us yet.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Babyghost,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"On a flight not long ago, Babyghost designers Joshua Hupper and Qiaoran Huang, seated separately, both watched Ultrasuede. The Halston documentary set their minds to the idea of making a Spring collection in homage to the great man. Still, Hupper says the two were fully aware of their potential to get overzealous, so rather than going full-throttle Studio 54, this season they asked themselves: What if we were trying to do this Halston collection for the Gap?\n",
      "That idea didnt necessarily come through so much in the final product (Babyghosts clothes have plainly too much of a point of view and too much idiosyncrasy to channel Gap in any palpable way), but it seemed to serve them well.\n",
      "Despite the season, this was a deliciously Goth-y lineup, light in feel if not in reference. The duo was inspired by Death, Clarence E. Flynns poem personifying the Big Sleep as a friendly force (Why do you fear me? it begins. I am your friend). So much so, in fact, that it came stitched in its entirety, along with an elegiac-looking depiction of Death on sheer tops and frocks. Most beautiful of all was on the transparent front panel of a twill skirt; the undersides of its seams came dappled with gold lam spots in a nod to Halston. The designers resisted other direct 70s references in favor of that and the transparent confetti-filled (thats Studio 54, natch) buttons on a printed shirt.\n",
      "All those were nice feats unto themselves, but still, Babyghosts most commendable move this season was one of self-awareness. Hupper: We want to make clothing [girls] want, not clothing we want them to wear. That meant wisely continuing to pare back the disparate graphic elements that have characterized Babyghost in seasons past in favor of bewitching, more basic pieces. The pair also debuted a lower-priced range, dubbed Stashhouse (muse, stylist, and Babyghost international playgirl Xiao Wen Ju was wearing one of the bombers at last nights presentation). It was the kind of strong effort that left you, if not undaunted by the reaper, keen to see what next season will bring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Badgley Mischka,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Buenos Aires of the 50s? Mark Badgley and James Mischka may have never made it there themselves, having been born several years too late, but the red carpet stalwarts imagined that milieu through a romantics lens as the basis of their Spring lineup.\n",
      "From the suntanned skin that the designers said informed a blush-heavy palette to the butterflies and flora, here was a depiction of B.A. straight out of some dreamy tourist brochure. Idealized, but never kitsch, the pair embraced their prcis wholeheartedly, integrating it into the labels classic silhouettes, beautifully tailored by day and very sensual and elegant by night, as Mischka put it backstage pre-show. The tailoring came to life with a swingy, warm-weather tweed shorts suit, the nighttime mood in a hothouse-looking floral lace gown and a metallic brushstroke jacquard. Backstage the designers offered that while their autumnal fabrics skew toward the more heavily encrusted, here was a relatively breezy profusion of frothy, lightweight tulles, chiffons, and georgettes.\n",
      "Gold foil butterflies on a blush tulle gown had a certain heady charm to them. Still, generally Badgley and Mischkas simplest propositions spoke the loudest: to wit, the plunging ivory top and gold beaded trousers, or a little caped black cocktail dress with a waterfall of bugle bead strands that cascaded down the back. Though if youre looking for an everyday shift for the office, well . . . look elsewhere. Our day starts at 5 p.m., Mischka laughed backstage, while Helen Mirren, sitting front row, called out an unapologetically glam strapless gown in white and metallic gold floral jacquard as her most coveted look.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Baja East,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"There was a buzz at todays Baja East show. Common, Miguel, and Mariska Hargitay were seated front row, and while the brands shows have historically been well attended since its inception (just two years ago), there was a noticeably higher showing of the industrys top faces. For Spring, designers Scott Studenberg and John Targon reimagined their signature urban nomad through the lens of rave, down to the polished take on kandi seen at models wrists and necks.\n",
      "Where the past has seen the Baja East palette go sun-bleached and spare, todays was a veritable riot of parrotlike shades, red, chiefly, but saturated blues and greens, too. Those all came to life in a punchy tie-dye print (weve seen a rash of the stuff at the shows already, but none so graphic as this take), spotted on silk caftans. That print was mirrored in the many, many multicolored, bingo granny bling Swarovski crystals covering white sweatshirts and tees. There was also a terrific multihued crochet, dappled with iridescent sequins.\n",
      "Backstage pre-show, Studenberg said that, ambisexual brand or not, roughly 90 percent of Bajas business is womens. As such, starting with Resort the designers have been increasing their focus on proper womens clothesthat is to say, less loungy pieces to complement those cashmere ponchos. Here, that yielded a tuxedo-style ivory dress with a knotted belt that came scattered in more Swarovski. There was even soft tailoring in the form of a scarlet blazer with a slim shawl collar.\n",
      "Bajas fortunes look promising: Theyre CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists, in key doors globally, and a growing name within the industry. Now, Studenberg and Targon are in the market for a key investor. The heightened commercial appeal of todays outing was a step toward that, and from the looks of it, the designers feel good about their odds: Both they and their models took a post-show victory lap, dancing all the way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Balenciaga,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Alexander Wangs three-year stint at Balenciaga is over. He went out dancing, snapping selfies and twirling down the runway. His swan song was the freest of any of the collections he did for the house, and the most tender. All in shades of ivory. All paraded softly out on lace slippers. All in soft, natural fabrics like linen, cotton, and voile with gentle, furling edges. It looked effortless, where the ones that preceded it felt effortful. \n",
      "Work began on this collection after the announcement was made that Wang and Balenciagas parent company Kering would not be renewing his contract. At the time Wang said hed be refocusing his attentions on his signature label. Maybe that awareness loosened him up. Maybe he really hunkered down, determined to go out on a high note. Whichever, its no small irony that his last and best collection for the brand was the one that was truest to his own bred-in-California sensibilities. A remix of The Notorious B.I.G.s iconic Going Back to Cali played on the soundtrack. Bella Heathcote, Riley Keough, Zo Kravitz, and other Hollywood friends of his with normal-sized, not overly thin bodies grounded the show in reality. Loungewear was at its soul, with boxer shorts peeking above waistlines and bra tops exposed under quilted jackets. \n",
      "As relaxed as its vibes were, a good deal of work went into the collections smocking, ruching, and ladder stitching, and yet it remained light. When you know its your last anything, you say, Lets take a risk, what do you have to lose? Wang said backstage. At a house thats known for innovation, I thought, Lets think about it the opposite way, lets think about fabrics and shapes that feel supple and simple, but approach them in an artisanal, couture way. \n",
      "Following Nicolas Ghesquire, the innovator Wang was referring to, had to be one of the toughest jobs in fashion. As Wang sped back down the runway tonight he nearly tripped over one of the shows reflecting pools before catching himself and continuing backstage. It was a pointed image. His own show was bigger than ever and one of the highlights of the New York calendar. The question isnt how Wang will fare now, but how Balenciaga will pick up the momentum again.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Bally,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"There was a glint of genius in Pablo Coppolas context-setting question for this collection, which ran: What will the bourgeois woman in 20 years time want to wear? Why genius? Well, the bourgeois woman of today is wearing a 90s-touched but 70s-heavy constellation of signifiers upgraded by the appropriation of post-sportswear streetwear. So it follows that a woman 20 years on will wear something heavily touched by whatever hindsight dictates is nowright nowin 2015/16, shot through with a lot from the 90s and made relevant by technology and trends that we cant even begin to anticipate.\n",
      "Were Coppola able to answer his question he would have discovered the Holy Grailfashions Flux Capacitora way to short-circuit the self-referential cycle of retrospection and push on into Where We Really Are. The essence of Now. So, did he? \n",
      "It would, of course, be impossible to be truly sure, but this didnt look like a bad bet. A double-breasted shirtdress, full length in heavy silk crepe, bore the six-buttoned imprint of functions pastabout as useful as an appendix yet reassuring somehowin a fundamentally minimal garment. The cream suiting had a flecked rustication to its finishCoppola said the intention had been to ape the raggedness of a toile but made ready-to-wear. Not in the lookbook but well worth a look were silk-mix bombers in olive and blush pink with cutely pop-openable backs to flash the spine, that ideally genderless, post fourth-wave feminism erogenous zone.\n",
      "There were foulard prints and hand-finished fringing and suspiciously perfect moth holes that were all inserted to heighten the sense of a garment crafted by hand. Next to the main collection, workers from Ballys recently acquired exotic leather atelier had been brought in to emphasize this still further. Inauthentically, however, their day-to-day tools had been confiscated for being too aesthetically unpleasing. One poor chap was heating his edging iron on a scented candle instead of a Bunsen burner. \n",
      "The testing is now complete at Bally: It is time to go from beta to full-release. Coppola has found his stride, and the 164-year-old Swiss brands new David Chipperfield retail proposition has had a year to bed on Bond Street. It will be rolled out in 12 international locations over the next 12 monthsfirst stop, Los Angeles. With collections such as these to fill them, Ballys new stores will feel relevant in 2016. And perhaps in years hence, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Balmain,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"Olivier Rousteings Balmain show has become such a magnet for fans and paparazzi that the police shut down the street outside the entrance to his Hotel Intercontinental venue today. Without Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West in the front row, the scene inside was much more subdued than last season. Rousteings own social media fame may not be at the level of the Kardashian clan, but when it comes to designers, few can touch him. Only Jeremy Scott and Riccardo Tisci come close. \n",
      "His online following made him an ideal candidate for the H&M collaboration going on sale next month, a point Rousteing made explicit in his notes: While this 15-minute presentation is designed to create strong impressions and reactions, its during the upcoming six months when the designs will make their mark. Social medias embrace of Balmain will provide us with daily reminders of the excitement of those who have found a new way to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Implicit in that statement was a riposte to his fashion-world detractors, of which there will likely be many after todays show. \n",
      "Rousteing toned down the color this season to focus on shades of nude, but there was no equivalent dialing-back of the embellishments that have weighed down his recent collections. The macram was as full-on as ever, and often in crystals or beads, and the tiered ruffles were even more flamboyant than last seasons silk pliss. Those ruffles notwithstanding, the silhouette was super clingy, loaded with cutouts and sheer paneling, and cinched with waist trainersize belts. Joan Smalls slithered down the runway in short, stretchy green suede, the shows best look, but the restrictive, tight-fitting tube skirts gave other models problems.\n",
      "As excessive as it all came off at todays show, these clothes look great in pictures. Rousteings macram really resonates on a tiny iPhone screen; the proof is in the Spring 16 outfits Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid wore last night on the town in Paris. #BalmainBooties and #BalmainBeauties temporarily replaced #BalmainArmy as Rousteings hashtag du jour. Who needs gatekeepers? The guys going to sell millions at H&M.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Banana Republic,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Creative director Marissa Webb is pushing Banana Republic in a new direction, meaning revamped patterns and new textures for both womenswear and menswear. In another important switch-up for the label, this collection also represented BRs first partnership with the CFDA, via a collaboration with New York designer Timo Weiland and partners Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang.\n",
      "All the changes were noticeable. For womenswear, Webb refreshingly shook up her pattern palette with a polished cream jumpsuit, which came in a blotted, watercolor floral print. A pair of wide-leg trousers striped in white and aqua offered a subdued cool. There was also a look in biting pink scale hues that caught the eyea striped salmon topper thrown over a lavender pleated frock. But it was Webbs focus on suiting that packed an understated and chic punch without a deliberate, changed-up feel. An off-white slouchy jacket and trouser set, as well as a jacket that was rendered into a vest, were both casual enough to be worn as separates with jeanssomething that Webb was also aiming for. \n",
      "Likewise, suiting received a makeover when it came to menswear. A manicured downtown approach was seen in a dandy-style shorts suit with a fitted double-breasted jacket that included a pocket square. For a more relaxed look, there was also a suede jacket paired with knee-skimming shorts.  \n",
      "One of the most refreshing additions came with Weilands work. There was an uptown elevation and a glossy take on prep that could translate for BR consumers outside of Weilands metropolitan home base. His riff on cocktail wear was great: a high-waisted, wide-pleated salmon skirt paired with a cropped tank and a sharp chambray shift dress. It was a good way for BR to infuse a dose of authentic city-side cool while also introducing new talent to the traditional customer.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Barbara Bui,Dan Thawley,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"There is that rock n roll side, and a sexy suita little bit boyish, you know. Its what I love to do, gushed Barbara Bui, air-kissing German photographer Ellen von Unwerth backstage at her Spring show today. And if its what Barbara loves to do, then its what Ellen loves to photographsexy, uncomplicated clothes that do double-time as a flamboyant urban wardrobe for the jet set, or perhaps those aspiring to join it.\n",
      "Underscored as a love letter to Bianca Jagger, Buis Spring collection traced a racy through line going from urban tailored separates (safari-tinged shirtdresses and city shorts or their romper equivalents) to wrapped bra tops and leggings, all cut in supple leather. Her material of choice channeled a retro lan when patchworked as a harlequin snakeskin suit, or an 80s shock in hot pink napa. It would take little imagination to picture a young Jagger poolside in the former option, or one of the seasons silk slipdresses, trapped by sculpted corset belts at the waist, their plunging necklines revealing bikinis beneath.\n",
      "Later, Bui took a gaucho trip involving fringed ponchos in tan or aubergine suede, for a South American theme that evolved into silk fringed eveningwear the designer called night owl embroidery (a suit and gown were positively festooned with the stuff). Those pieces swung past, begging for serious dance-floor real estate, but its probably the no-fuss sex appeal of Buis daywear that will lure her ladies in. Hell for leather, if you will.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Barbara Casasola,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Strong? Absolutely. Serene? No diggity. But can minimalism ever be sexy? While thats a pretty subjective questioneverythings something to someoneon the whole youd think: nope. Minimalisms (putatively) intellectual commitment to distillation of form and austerity of delivery is just too cold to be hot.\n",
      "Yet today, sometimes, that was sort of what Barbara Casasola was pitching for in this collection. And, impressively, she sometimes sort of succeeded. My woman is very sensual, she said post-show, and thats what I do is about. Her baseline daywear proposition starred loosely languid tailoring (smashing jackets), finely rendered silk bowling shirts, and some comely high-waisted silk pants that had the puckered texture of paper splashed with water and left to dry again. The hot stuff was a more ambitious series of fitted dresses and jumpsuits cast in polyester-spiked pliss taffeta and textured, knit silk. Although mostly either monochrome or day-spa dark rusty-neutral in tone, Casasola variously oomphed them up with Bardot necklines, grids of tiny incisions, cutaways at the abdomen, or lines of larger welts in the material that ran down the side of her outfits from shoulder to hem to achieve what the press notes coyly termed a fragile reveal. Casasola rather short-circuited this interplay between inhibition and abandon with a section that beachily whispered of her Brazilianness, most notably in a roughly woven full-length green skirt partnered with an (unreliable) bandeau and gleaming gold totem jewelry. This designer spent a few years at Roberto Cavalli, and although she correctly observed that his and her aesthetics are very differentoh, yesshe learned enough from the old devil to make this an at-times-effective exercise in date-night minimalism.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Barbara Tfank,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"An eight-day trip to England proved fertile ground for Barbara Tfank, who based her Spring 2016 collection, called My Journey, on the various sites she visited on her travels.\n",
      "Tfank and her husband were invited to lunch by a deputy speaker of the House of Lords, and the designer had a chance to visit the storied hall at the Palace of Westminster. I was so taken by the decor and these perfectly maintained 19th-century roomsthe ornateness of the wall treatments, the moldings and the fabrics, said Tfank. That lent itself organically to Tfanks textile-centric design sensibility: There were plenty of brocades tinged with metallic embroidery that would have looked just spiffy in an 1800s-era sitting room. Of course, thats not always an ideal thing: Theres a reason the palace is considered a historical site, and some of Tfanks creations came off a tad antiquated, an impression not helped by the upswept retro hairstyle.\n",
      "Her inspiration translated best on a pink-and-green brocade column gown with a back panel, a dress that reminded one of the kind of chintz curtains of the era and yet still somehow managed to feel fresh. Also fresh: a handful of evening separates, including a full brocade skirt with contrasting leather waistband, styled with a crop top that might entice some younger customers.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,BCBG Max Azria,Nick Remsen,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Every season, we pick a destination, but this time, its Southern California, Los Angeleswere staying right here! Lubov Azria, in gray, post-summer NYC, thusly granted a final blissfully warm day with her BCBG Max Azria lineup. Surf, skate, musicthe ways California changed the world, but a new proposal. \n",
      "First things first: More than a few front-rowers were Snapchatting (though with limited cell service inside Moynihan Station) the patchwork bucket hats. Yes, Azria has made the bucket hat cool again. Below the toppers, it was all layers, like embroidered vests, lightweight knits, tie-dyed T-shirts, and floor-dusting pants, some in twilight-hued blocked gradients: Ventura, with polish and smart styling. \n",
      "At points, there was even a hint of Burning Man among all the Coachella, such as in the case of a metallic gold jacquard jacket. That may have been inspired by the Pacifics bronze glow on one of Azrias marathon training runs through Toluca Lake. With platform cutout-toe boots, cozy bits like knit leg warmers, and a few great beach dresses, it felt good to soak up the sun one last time.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Beaufille,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" October 15, 2015\",\"When there are two designers who run a labellet alone two siblingsyou cant help but wonder how often they clash behind the scenes. For Beaufilles Parris Gordon and Chlo Gordon, sisterly disagreements are inevitable, but their unique, lifelong bond also makes them ideal collaborators. Chlo, whose background is in textiles, knows which knits or tech fabrics will work best with Parriss hardware and jewelry (Parris studied metalsmithing), and vice versa. From there, the collection sort of unfolds organically, and Spring was particularly harmonious.\n",
      "In the past, we would think of really specific inspirations and start there, but now we kind of work backward, Parris explained. Were working more intuitively. Of Spring 16s sharp lines, silver ring cutouts, and high-tech materials, she said, We immediately thought it looked retro-futuristictheres a Star Warsin-the-70s quality. That mood came through best in a mid-length ivory slip dress with D-rings and trailing ribbons at the shoulders. Slips are a huge trend for Spring, but theyve been a Beaufille best-seller for a few seasons now. Elsewhere, the ring details became more prominent, creating pockets of air on a sleeveless jacket or dotting the curved edge of a dress. Cropped flares with chunky zippers also stood out; both the rust suede and black jersey varieties would give your favorite jeans a run for their money. In addition to that minimal, sculptural theme, there was an emphasis on more artisanal details, like a one-shoulder top that looked like it was made of tangled threads. Chlo handmade it by throwing bundles of yarn into water-soluble bags, pinning the strings together, and embroidering them over and over for hours at a time. Then she dunked the mass in a bathtub and watched the bags dissolve, so all that was left was the manipulated fabric. Consider it a modern take on lace or crochetwith just a touch of high tech.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Belstaff,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"How better to purge any lingering associational residue of Belstaffs first luxury womenswear iterationwhich was just too hard, uptight, and uptown to be consistent with this free-wheeling biker brands identitythan with a vigorous salt wash?\n",
      "Delphine Ninous dappled this collection with a seascape print that featured on jacquard turtlenecks, reversible double-layer organza and shiny nylon bombers, and the opening asymmetrical silk dress. She had been thinking of the ocean and the elements and so forth, she said. This set the tone for a concerted exercise in softening through gentle erosion. Field jackets bore the utilitarian hoo-ha of military taping and poachers pockets but on treated linen or a silky, featherlight technical material worn over an earthy oatmeal Guernsey. The biker was recast in jersey-bonded stretch suede, a really impressive fabrication, with shoulder guards and small-of-the-back corrugations in lightly crackled leather. Matching pants, too.\n",
      "There was a sleeveless hybrid of dress and coat decorated with the neckline, quilting, hardware, and leather strapping of Ninouss materialswhich made for quite a muster of references. The designer confessed that a significant part of her role is to investigate this amazing archive of DNA from Belstaff and think, Okay, how can I tweak it?, but she is also empowered sometimes to roam off-road. After all, there was nothing biker in her wide lace-paneled white cotton pants, or in the fine entwined peep-toe sandals, orstrapping apartin the loose linen striped overcoats. And thats all for the good: Incorporating house codes makes a fine starting point, but from there on its time to take off.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Bernhard Willhelm,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Bernhard Willhelms latest collection was totally bananas. Literally: Bananas were Willhelms inspiration this season, and his clothings key motif. There were embroidered banana designs elaborated with loops of fringe, a print of a man eating a banana, three-dimensional banana appliqus, and more. The bananas were ludicrousnot to mention suggestivewhich was precisely Willhelms point. The designer was celebrating randomness in this ostentatiously cheerful outing, which featured lots of sliced and distressed square-cut clothes, and zero instances of the color black. \n",
      "Willhelm was being playful, but his is serious play. To engage with his clothes means engaging with the idea that people could dress in a way far removed from what we see on the street today. The naivet of his methodsthe knotting and slashing and seemingly improvisational drapingas well as his touches of applied damage, like dip-dye or shredded hems, all together suggested a uniform worked out spontaneously by a lost tribe of club kids who had decided to make a society of their own, from scratch. In said society, gender is a nonissueyou wear what you likeand it just so happens that one of the members of this new utopia is a master maker of intarsia knits, with access to hand-embroiderers in India and placement printers in Japan. Which is a roundabout way of noting that Willhelms clothes may look bananas, but the designer himself is not. Theres both method and sophistication to his madness.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Betsey Johnson,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"The Betsey Johnson show is always an over-the-top extravaganza, an unhinged get-together, and a wild culmination of many inspirations. Today there was another raging party backstagea clamor of models in sky-high heels and bass-thunking raps by Azealia Banks. But though Johnson was in her vivacious element, she still paid attention to some serious themes: the 73-year-old designer pulled out a tank top with an American flag on it that she designed in 2001. Its for 9/11. Ive saved it all these years, she said. Im going to wear it for the fireman. After all, Johnson has seen a lot in her time as a designerand today was also a celebration of her 50 years in the fashion industry. On top of that, there was a point person she had to thank, as well. Two hours before the show, Johnson arranged a car to pick up her 94-year-old dance instructor, Ann Pimm, to attend the show. Ive dedicated the show to her, said Johnson. I studied with her forever and she brought me to New York to study.\n",
      "With dance as the theme, as well as her five decades of experience in the industry, Johnson squeezed half a century onto the runway. The first looks were set in the present, with Nicki Minajesque pieces like a bubblegum corseted tutu dress on top of a neon blue net shirt. As for the 90s, Johnson gave grunge a playful riff with rose-patterned tutu dresses fastened with blue corsets paired with cherry print tights. There was also the rock attitude of the 80s, which included jumpsuits with punchy pinstripes, and a very cool plastic jacket outfitted with zippers on the sleeves. \n",
      "But it was the 60s that introduced the most wearable looks. There was a strong Twiggy influence in a mod-style Mandarin-collar striped pantsuit, as well as a polka-dotted minidress with an oversize collar and sleeves. Baring some skin, there was a slinky violet dress with the naval-skimming dcolletage opening bound by mini bows.\n",
      "The last looks, which hailed from the 50s, were the most sentimental: Johnson designed the pieces based on her original dance costumes as a child. There were charming, nude leotards adorned with mini frills at the waist and striped with sequins, as well as a bedazzled red crop top and a pleated miniskirt. For the grand finale, before Johnson did her traditional cartwheel, she handed Pimm a bouquet of flowers. Then she was followed by models in leotards printed with American flags, proving that the designer always remembers the important things.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Bibhu Mohapatra,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"Im a very emotional designer, Bibhu Mohapatra said before his Spring 2016 show. Whether its a fabric or a material or an artisan story, I hold on to them until it feels right.\n",
      "As a counterpoint to last season, when Mohapatra was mourning the loss of his father, the designer wanted this collection to be much more spirited and celebratory. He chose as his muse Annemarie Schwarzenbach, a woman who has long held his fascination and whom the designer felt embodied the joie de vivre of the collection. Schwarzenbach was a trailblazera glamorous and itinerant journalist and photographer who was known for her singular androgynous style in 30s Europe. But she also died young, at the age of 34. She had a short but very impactful life, and thats something to be celebrated, said Mohapatra.\n",
      "Instead of riffing on Schwarzenbachs menswear-influenced personal stylewhich would have strayed too far from the brands core aestheticMohapatra instead opted to infuse his feminine and sophisticated silhouettes with elements of Bauhaus, the school of art that Schwarzenbach subscribed to. Mohapatra beautifully captured that modernist and geometric style in his prints, many of which were inspired by discarded Bauhaus drawings. Highlights included a warped circle print that repeated itself on tops and dresses, and an overblown multicolored design, iridescent with sequins, that appeared on dresses and pants. Elsewhere Mohapatra incorporated elements of the schools architectural aesthetic. Thigh-high slits were effectively updated by squaring off the opening at the topa nice graphic touch. Dresses and tops had structure and often were sliced to reveal surprising panels of tulle and silk organza.\n",
      "Mohapatra is also emotionally invested in the fabrics he uses and the artisans he works with: The designer could barely suppress his excitement backstage when showing a jacket constructed from thin strips of leather and silk that was hand-woven in Laos. Surprisingly delicate, and fascinating to look at up close, the fabrication was certainly worth the fuss.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,BLK DNM,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 5, 2015\",\"In the wake of founder Johan Lindebergs departure back in May, BLK DNM has opted to move forward without appointing a successor, instead leaving design duties up to the studio team. Lindebergs vision for the brand has left them a concrete aesthetic vernacular to be built upon; Spring 16 marks his last season, a collection handled in part by him and in part by the in-house talents. Here, Lindebergs chief preoccupationsfreewheeling 60s and 70s rock n roll sensibilities quintessentially embodied by everyone from Keith Richards and Gram Parsons to Patti Smithcame to life in wearable, 21st-century ways. \n",
      "There was plenty of common ground between this and the seasons menswear offering, and why not? Chances are the BLK DNM girls beau dresses as well as (if not better than) she does. Consider a whiskey-color jacket decked out in yards of fabulous, shuddering fringe; that same fabrication came to life as a sweet, Jane Birkinesque shift, too. Quiet touches like pony beads, spotted dangling off the zips of a leather jacket, were proof that the devil is in the detailsand that those details add appeal that goes a long way in setting BLK DNMs takes on well-trod iconic pieces apart from the pack. Likewise, tailoring has always been a strong suit of the lines, and the revival of an old silhouettethe terrific shawl-collar Blazer 32could scarcely be more timely: Not long before the launch of this collection, Kendall Jenner was spotted out and about in a vintage iteration of the style.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Blumarine,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"A house fondness for bloom-bordered sheerness makes Blumarine a show thats relished by the bawdy band of runway photographersits their Friday morning double espresso. Outside the pit, however, that emphasis on garlanded nudity can feel unsettlingly anachronistic.\n",
      "Yet to be understood, Blumarine needs first to be examined in terms of its anthropology. Anna Molinaris line reflects an Italian sensibility, a Chi magazine (Italy's answer to Us Weekly) reader's raunch-touched interpretation of ethereal romance that Blumarine, fueled by its original success in knitwear manufacturing, gave rise to.  And the audience at todays show was ample evidence that this constituency is still in fine fettle. Thus the screen-print stemmed-rose-silhouette tulle skirts, shirts, and gowns, sometimes monochrome, sometimes in a reduced-rainbow palette accented with stripes. A jacket of pastel-sequined camouflagedesigned to help you blend out of the backgroundwas worn over a flower-appliqud silk smock in violet beach stripe and some superwide, cut-at-the-side, pink Bengal-stripe pants.\n",
      "Those pants pointed to the unexpected element in this lineup. Just as Rodolfo Paglialunga did for his debut Jil Sander collectionSpring 201512 months ago, team Blumarine turned to the completely fabulous, androgynous-dressing, progenitor Swiss photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach for its thematic inspiration. Schwarzenbach very much is a now-appropriate cipher, and the interpretation of her here was expressed in high-cut, loosely pocketed, hardware-shorn field jacketbiker hybridsand those pants. This was Blumarines nod to gender fluidity, and along with the masculine accent of that Bengal stripe, it reflected a sincere effort to flavor the house cocktail with a fresh dose. In chambray especially, and black satin up to a point, it kind of convinced. Although the photographers were disappointed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Boss,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"Julianne Moore wore a Le Smokingstyle jumpsuit by Bosss Jason Wu at the Toronto International Film Festival last weekend. She looked fantastic. The strapless black jumpsuit reappeared on the runway this afternoon, but its formality meant it was an outlier in Wus new collection for the German brand. Now in his fourth runway season, hes focused on growing the Boss universe: To do so, he focused mostly on daywear of the decidedly breezy variety for Spring. \n",
      "To start he gave the Boss suit a makeover, elongating the jacket, hacking off the sleeves, and adding fringe to the lapels; full trousers were cropped above the ankle. The tailoring felt airier than his previous work here and freer, even when the jackets had full sleeves. The same goes for his dresses. Who knows why, but Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have emerged as a significant New York trend, not only on the runways, but also on the street. Wu used them to winning effect, cutting delicate sleeveless dresses in bright shades of flame red, cobalt, and lemon yellow organza. Their split skirts and handkerchief hems swirled weightlessly as they came down the runway.\n",
      "Until now Wu has avoided prints at Boss. Giving them a go today, he experimented with an etched, gray-tone floral. It felt a bit anemic side by side with the Bauhaus colors of the pleated dresses. A pair of sheaths in a two-tone woven tweed with frayed edges were bolder. All in all, an assured outing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Bottega Veneta,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"The great outdoors was calling this morning at Bottega Veneta. Its Indian summer here in Milan, and everyone working in the city is trying to hold on to that serene vacation mood while the sunshine lasts. So is Tomas Maier, it seems, as he showed a collection inspired by big country, open air, trekking, and sailing. The farther he can get from an urban environment, he says, the better it gets.\n",
      "With the exception of teenagers, most everybody can relate to that impulse, and Bottega Veneta has never been for the underage anyway. Maiers self-appointed task is to get inside the desires of women with money to spend, and for Spring he is persuading them to crave more casual clothes. He opened with looks evolved from tracksuits, with zippered jackets and cropped pants; throughout his daywear, he wove a brownish-green camouflage theme patched in with leopard print. On the feet: flat loafers, thong sandals, and clogs.\n",
      "Still, theres no avoiding the fact that Bottega Venetas customers must eventually face the city and its various social occasions. So for the urban jungle, there was a tailored pantsuit and blouse printed in Maiers abstract camo patternnot exactly designed for merging into the background but rather for standing out from the herd as a bold fashion-adopter (printed pantsuits have been head-turners at Gucci, Versace, and Roberto Cavalli, too). There was one intricately pieced red leather and python coat and several patchworked shift dresses that radiated the kind of highly crafted exclusiveness Bottega Veneta fans love.\n",
      "What do you do when you want to bring a sense of the big outdoors to party dresses, though? Maiers solution: frocks in techno-cottons, ingeniously wrapped and grommeted, with slim guy-ropes as shoulder straps. They werent exactly tents, but some of them had that feeling about them. Maybe for a woman whod secretly rather spend her summer nights under the stars?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Bouchra Jarrar,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"Tatiana Maslany, the Canadian star of Orphan Black, wore an ivory Le Smoking by Bouchra Jarrar to the Emmys last month. Admittedly, there wasnt much in the way of competition, but she was easily among the chicest women at the ceremony, elegant where other actresses looked try-hard or just plain wrong. Its nice to see Hollywood waking up to Jarrars red carpet potential; shes putting a new emphasis on dress-up clothes at her couture shows. For ready-to-wear, presented in her premier arrondissement atelier, which is becoming increasingly crowded as the seasons progress, shes focused on a more everyday kind of elegance. \n",
      "In a first for Jarrar, there was a tailored pantsuit in a dark-rinse denim, the softness of which defied expectations. Softness was truly the order of the day, be it a caramel-color shrunken leather blouson and matching skirt with an arching slit or a navy viscose trench with a high storm flap and epaulets. But Jarrar was equally concerned with the collections graphic punch, juxtaposing the high-contrast animal print of an elongated gilet with the black lace of a long-sleeved top, or piecing together a sexy asymmetrical tank top with patent shoulder straps from diagonal slices of tech fabric and leather. We cant help circling back around to her smoking jackets though. Does anyone anywhere cut one better?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Brandon Maxwell,Steff Yotka,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"For a first-time designer, Brandon Maxwell knows what hes doing. With the uptown location of Mr. Chow as his show venue and a guest list so edited, every name read as a Who's Who of the fashion world, Maxwell had the odds stacked in his favor at his premiere New York Fashion Week presentation. That says nothing of the fact that he joins the design community as Lady Gagas longtime stylist who has covered magazines arm in arm with the singer and who calls Gaga's frequent collaborators Steven Klein, Alexander Wang, and Inez and Vinoodh his friends. Then there was Gaga herself, perched front row in one of his designs, cheering on models as they walked by and breaking into tears of joy as the finale gowns brushed passed her. In a season where designers are striving for intimate, personal settings, Maxwell truly nailed it. \n",
      "But what of the clothes? With power women as his starting point, Maxwell sent out sharply tailored separates in black, ivory, and a dusty rose, culminating in several over-the-top gowns. Nearly every look featured some element of ridged pleating, a motif derived from Maxwells childhood practice of dressing up his sisters in bed sheets and fastening them with his fathers cummerbunds. The effect worked best when it was used minimally, like on the lapels of second-skin dinner jackets or around the waist of tailored trousers. A high-neck white wrap dress and black, billowy-sleeved frock edged into costume territory, the sort of things that could only be pulled off by someone with a commanding presence to rival Gagas. For those looking for just a touch of diva, wed recommend the cut-to-there minidress on Ophelie Guillermand. Sexy without question, but a little better suited for off-stage activities.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Brock Collection,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Brock Collection is still a relatively young label, but husband-and-wife duo Kris Brock and Laura Vassar have already established their signatures. Theyre proponents of an unfussy femininity thats rooted in luxe fabrics and simple silhouettes. Brocade in particular is a Brock staple; its appeared in every collection thus far, from midi-length skirts to billowing, floor-grazing shirtdresses. For Spring, the textures were even more opulentsee the hand-embroidered cotton dresses and ivory python pencil skirt. Those items took elevated daywear to an entirely new place.\n",
      "Brock and Vassars point of view is more about subtle flourishes than specific themes, but they did cite architecture as an influence. We designed the collection while we were living at my parents house, which my mom designed, Vassar explained at their peaceful High Line Room presentation. Its all Gustavian and Swedish style, so its really simple and beautiful with clean lines. So we were thinking a lot about restraintI think its harder to restrain yourself than it is to go overboard. Where they could have added more structure or embellishment to their garments, they held back. One of the best examples of this philosophy was actually made up of two classics: a striped shirt that extended to the floor (and could also be worn as a dress) layered over cropped jeans. Mixing in those casual, humble textures is another Brock signature, ensuring the clothes feel special, but not precious. These were luxurious pieces meant to be worn in your real life, a point that was highlighted by the models footwear: Each look was paired with flat python sandals, a new category for the designers. Heres hoping Brock bags are next.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Brunello Cucinelli,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"The charm of irregularity is how Brunello Cucinelli described the spirit of his Spring collection, a lineup of fluid shapes in creamy whites where raw textures took center stage. Inspired by the elegant beach resorts of the Annes Folles, and the sophisticated yet dgag style of the decadent elites of that era who holidayed in Deauville and Biarritz, the style was relaxed and soft with a subtle retro feel. A touch of modernity was added through references to the Japanese love of organic materialstheir traditional streamlined, minimal lines and sophisticated cutting techniques.\n",
      "Embracing imperfections is a fascinating concept, because it mirrors nature and the flow of life itself, said a dapper Cucinelli, pointing out sweaters knitted with raw hemp, dusters cut from buttery-soft raw silk, and cardigans in corrugated yet supersoft yarns. Pants were the foundation of the collection, which, despite the exotic visual inspiration, was rooted in practicality and wearable day looks. Ankle-grazing culottes were gathered and softly pleated at the waist; a wraparound skirttrouser hybrid looked modern. Paired with a pearl gray shaved mink sleeveless top, it added a touch of luxe to the lineup.\n",
      "Jackets were elongated and masculine with a relaxed feel, due to the use of ultra-lightweight fabrics. Garonne-style cardigans recalled the sophisticated insouciance and the sporty elegance of the 20s, but were given the signature Cucinelli treatment: Crafted with raw, precious fibers, they were deconstructed to achieve a sort of chubby yet fluid effect. Id like my style to be extremely versatile, day-to-night, ageless, timeless, perfect for women of all ages and sizes, he enthused. Case in point: His elegant wife and their two young daughters were on handand all looking at ease clad in head-to-toe Cucinelli.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Burberry Prorsum,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Burberry's heritage might be centuries old, but Christopher Baileys vision for the brand is relentlessly forward-thinking. Twenty-four hours before the lights went up on the Burberry Prorsum runway, a sneak peek of the collection was staged on Snapchat. Having recently announced a partnership with Apple Music, it seems the CEO and chief creative is forging ahead with other tech and sound alliances too, and attendees of todays show were treated to a mini concert by Alison Moyet, a video of which will be launched exclusively with the music-sharing service.\n",
      "Performing with a 32-piece orchestra, Moyets ethereal vocals set the darkly romantic tone of the show, and the first model was dressed in head-to-toe blacka thigh-grazing lace minidress, classic trenchcoat, sporty rubber-soled sandals, and a nylon backpack. That mishmash of techy sportswear and delicate vintage-inspired eveningwear was cut with militaristic details throughout: Peacoats came studded with brass, Sgt. Pepperstyle regimental buttons, and slinky satin silk skirts were finished with metallic cording of the kind you might find on a soldiers uniform. In fact, they were made by the same embroiderers that decorate the coats of the Queens Guard, just a stones throw away at Kensington Palace. Clearly homegrown production values are still on the agenda, and much of the lace was made in the U.K., too.\n",
      "Bailey never fails to keep the bigger picture in mind, though, and he explained backstage after the show that, for him, the idea of traditional seasons has essentially become obsolete: Showing those pretty 40s-inspired slips with a cozy, sheared mink coat as well as light summer trenchcoats makes sense in a global market. \n",
      "And speaking of slip dressinga trend that has been inescapable on both sides of the pondKate Moss, the woman who took the look to the world stage in the 90s, was sitting in the front row next to Londons current reigning cool girl Cara Delevingne. With a social media following in the millions, the model turned actress has an enormous sphere of influence. The counterintuitive styling of the show, where a hoodie and a bias-cut silk dress can happily coexist in the space of one look, had modern verve and spoke to the kind of #OOTDs that live in her Instagram feed. After the Internet frenzy for Burberrys Fall 2015 monogrammed blanket, the brands new nylon backpack, which was embroidered with Delevingnes initials and sat in her lap today, is likely to go viral just as quickly.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Cacharel,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"For several seasons, a visit to the Cacharel showroom has been prefaced with the same party line about rediscovering the brand heritage and modernizing it for today. And its tough to take umbrage with clothes that are intentioned, unchallenging, and, more often than not, patterned in flowers. Aside from a venue change to new, well-appointed headquarters on the Left Bank, not much has changed. Which is not necessarily a criticism. The lookbook, shot by millennial photographer Alexandra Sophie, refers to the Cacharel style as Lady 2.0, a catchall that neatly encompasses the signature drop-waist dresses, lace polo tops, and a novelty trench printed with pastel canaries. Indeed, the design studio continues to propose a variety of stylized florals (this time, anemones, poppies, peonies, and a vintage botanical print) alongside everyday overcoats, breezy blouses, and respectable skirts, all corresponding in proportion and palette.\n",
      "One update: Cacharel collaborated with Notify jeans, and the boyfriend styles offset the range of romantic blouses, from embroidered mousseline to broderie anglaise. Oh, and another: A stand-alone store in the French capital is scheduled to open sometime next year. By then perhaps we will see a bit more originality in a way that generates excitement for a deserving brand. The new office is a stones throw from the Muse dOrsay, home to some of the most beautiful flower paintings ever created. Just a thought.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Calvin Klein Collection,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Calvin Klein designed an era-defining collection of slip dresses for Spring 1994. The models in that showKate Moss, Bridget Hall, Michele Hickswent on to rule the runways for a decade, and the dress became a house icon. The only piece of clothing Klein might be more famous for is his instantly recognizable logo briefs. Twenty-odd years later, perhaps thanks to Internet-fueled nostalgia, or maybe greater cultural forces, contemporary designers are looking back at those early 90s days. Those skimpy silk frocks were all over the New York shows this week, including at Francisco Costas excellent offering for Calvin Klein Collection today. \n",
      "Costa is well-versed in the labels heritage, but the new Calvin Klein Collection slip dresses are different from the ones of old. Call it grunge deconstruction: Theyre slack at the bust, extra straps dangle every which way, and knit versions stitched with brass chains fray and disintegrate towards the hem. Costa imagined the morning after a liaison, when a woman might toss her lovers tailored jacket and too-big pants over her lingerie, and the tailoring, too, got the deconstruction treatment. Pant hems unraveled, jacket hems were partially sliced away, and sleeves extended almost to the fingertips or were sliced up the seam halfway to the elbows. It was new to see Costa embrace the disarray; in the past hes erred on the side of orderly. \n",
      "The collections biggest surprise was the photo prints of flowers that appeared on dresses, pants, and a trench alike. Costa doesnt usually show that much pattern on his runway. Its rarer still for it to have such sweet connotations. Heres hoping he indulges his romantic impulses again sometime soon.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Camilla and Marc,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Camilla Freeman-Topper and Marc Freeman shot the lookbook for their new collection inside Frank Gehrys recently opened paper bag building in Sydney, a new wing of the citys University of Technology. The buildings swirling metallic interior wasnt the inspiration for the siblings new clothes, but it may as well have been: This outing was all about curvilinearity, refraction, and controlled swoops of volume.\n",
      "The volume story came through with greatest force in this collections trumpet-shaped sleeves and skirt hems. High-necked tunics and densely knit off-the-shoulder tops with bell-like silhouettes echoed the theme, and numbered among this outings standout pieces. This was a notably restrained and sophisticated effort for Camilla and Marcthe froth was curtailed to diaphanous silk and velvet burnout dresses that were understated enough to sit nicely with the collections classically glam draped silk satin looks for evening. The flourishes likewise erred toward a high tonesome decorous eyelash fringe, a touch of metallic. The sprightliest looks here were the ones that featured holographic polka dots woven into lightweight black jacquard.\n",
      "The other graphic pop here came from Camilla and Marcs abstract print, which picked up on the waves built into the collections drapes and flares. The print was attractive and eye-catching, but what stuck with you about this collection were the subtler effects, in particular the ways that Freeman and Freeman-Topper incorporated a sense of openness and fluidity into their generally attenuated silhouettes. The line was long and lean but not constricted. Lots of women will appreciate that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Carolina Herrera,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"The Frick Collection has never opened its doors for a fashion show. Over the years, many designers have asked, but the answer was always no. This season Carolina Herrera heard yes. The skylit atrium is a transporting place; its Beaux Arts grandeur might have tempted Herrera to look back in time for inspiration, but shes a resolutely modern-minded designer. She has been quick to embrace high-tech materials and figure out ways to incorporate them into her tony, uptown aesthetic. This season, more than ever, she put them to work. \n",
      "On a preshow tour through her backstage dressing area, the buzzword was pleats, but not old-fashioned pleats. Herreras are trompe loeil, narrow bands of tech fabric stitched onto transparent mesh of different densities. Sometimes the tulle disappeared on the skinand sheer paneling has never looked more decorous or discreet. On other pieces, it was thicker, almost like athletic mesh, creating a sporty mien. The second talking point was pink. Im in my rose period, Herrera said. From a flirty day dress (real pleats, not trompe loeil) in a delicate shade of blush to an embroidered shift in raspberry suede, there was no shortage of the shade, and it did a good job of warming up the somewhat clinical feel of the synthetic materials. For those not predisposed to pink, there were a few other frocks in black and white and a nice-looking, vaguely New Look suit in midnight blue flocked velvet. Herrera was eager to avoid prints because shes done them so often in the past. Like we said, resolutely modern-minded. Still, that rose-print slip dress was awfully pretty.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Carven,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"Alexis Martial and Adrien Caillaudaud took the ultra-gamine Carven girl on a deep-sea dive for their Spring 2016 collection, exercising their ability to produce neat tailoring, sporty details, and the type of kicky, youthful A-line silhouettes that consistently bring the ingenues running, credit cards extended. The story, said Martial and Caillaudaud backstagewhile standing before an inspiration board posted with Corinne Days portraits of Kate Moss for The Face, early female scuba divers, and assorted oceanic creatureswas of a girl in search of a seaside adventure. She ditches her boyfriend (but packs some of his shirts to wear with her minis) and learns to scuba dive. Eventually, as the looks lead into evening, she goes back to the city; only now shes wearing her souvenirs. \n",
      "And true to the narrative, nautical touches on suiting and separates (eyelets as portholes!) gave way to transparent logo tees paired with a Grey Gardensesque shirt-as-skirt (Because youre on the boat and you really dont care, said Caillaudaud) and, eventually, a long and lean silhouette, often centered around a narrow crepe pant anchored by a clunky sandal. But while prints were derived from sea creatures (jellyfish, octopuses, striped puffer fish, all covered in fluorescent spots and striations) and one stiff frocks frilled edges were reminiscent of undulating tentacles, most of the clothesbarring at least one excellent knit, which boasted dangling, beaded fringelacked the movement inherent to the life aquatic, favoring instead the rigid thickness of decidedly un-casual clothes. Adventure, after all, is about freedomand even ingenues need some wiggle room.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Cdric Charlier,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"For his Spring 2016 collection, Cdric Charlier was driven to abstractionspecifically to the work of Victor Pasmore, who is credited with pioneering abstract art in Britain in the first half of the 20th century. Pasmore was a painter and an architect, too, but there was none of that kind of sculptural quality to Charliers designs, which, in most cases, were worn away from the body, hanging straight down from the shoulders or cinched at the waist by thick obi-style belts, which also hung loose off the backs of some dresses, trailing behind the models as they walked. \n",
      "Silhouette was clearly foremost in the designers mind. I was really interested in this T shape, Charlier explained backstage before the show, tracing the trunk and shoulders of one of the model images on his run of show, and it showed: The shoulders were the strongest point on a majority of looks, with skirts typically ending in a loose ruffle and trousers in a frayed hem. The palette was predominantly neutral, in shades of blush, pink, and peach, occasionally dipping into hunter green, and the fabrics were mostly natural fibersas Charlier said, he wanted to stay with cotton and silk for as much of the collection as possible. It was all designed for day, from the boxy shirtdresses with plenty of hanger appeal to the military-style anoraks done in waxed cotton and cotton jacquard. Most winning were the mixed-print patchwork dresses, which felt hard and soft all at once, with all of the grace of Pasmores own Roses in a Jaronly this version you can wear to your next garden party.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Cline,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Its about taking her out of urban life and putting her feet on the sand. Its where I long to be, more and more, said Phoebe Philo in her debrief about Cline, as dozens of journalists jostled to shove their iPhones in her face. But the background of Clineits conceptual tented setting, its variety, the storming briskness of her modelscannot be captured in a convenient old-school sound bite about color, silhouette, and theme. Philo rebuilt Cline by trusting her instincts, and by trusting that other women are tuned into the same wavelength. And now shes getting more outspoken about it. I am somebody who is interested in how clothes make us feel, she said, and in how we behave in different places. I thought, If you were traveling for a year, what would you need to take with you?\n",
      "Where were her model-avatars heading? The space, constructed by FOS, a Danish installation artist, suggested something between a festival hangout and an art biennial in a hot locale, but the music was a mechanistic drumming that kept pace with the stream of girls, marching swiftly and with intent, shod in utilitarian ankle boots, or almost-medieval woven-leather pointy flats.  \n",
      "If anything has turned a corner at Cline since the last couple of shows, its the feeling that an incipient conceptualism and eccentricity has been jettisoned. Instead, this was a grounded collection, a sophisticates compendium, giving the definitive word on wearing the 90s slip dress in pulled-together grown-up style; on handling the 80s tendency with a curvy shoulder line and a Jean Paul Gaultier rib-knit waist; on nodding to the milkmaid neckline with an abstracted trompe loeil corseting; and on pants, pants, pants. What with the English menswear tweedy checked suiting, the wide cropped pair of trousers in extraordinarily high-shine black satin and, then, the olive green army parka and pants that swing out at the end, Philo reminded all and sundry that this is the house that services women with the best cuts available.\n",
      "Yet on the other hand, Cline is also a dress source. And here, there was a full spectrum of those as well, not just plunging lace-edged slips but practical workday survival looks in utititarian linen, and then, for evening or perhaps day-wafting on holiday, long fluid jersey dresses with high-waisted bodices and chaste-medieval scooped necks. A telling reaction to this collection was the instant straw poll going on among guests as they poured out of the show. Asking each other what they liked best, everyone had a different answer. And thats the way it is, today: There is, and should be, no one look, but a spectrum of equally valid looks for many of us to feel like ourselves in. Phoebe Philos genius is that she holds the mirror up to that emotional reality. Applause.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,CG,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Does a vulnerable woman have to be weak? Chris Gelinas posed that question today and, with his Spring collection, offered up the answer as he saw it: certainly not. Taking as his central motif a graphic spin on one of Irving Penns famous flowersa punchy version of a typically fragile thingGelinas toyed with different takes on the idea of controlled exposure. His opening look, a barely there white tank and hot pants, came topped with a hardy coat in a menswear-inspired plaid. Elsewhere, languid dresses came with curving seams that buttoned (or unbuttoned) all the way up. Gelinas noted that while his clientele of a certain age would wear them the traditional way, his more directional young shopper could well opt to undo them, throw on a pair of shorts, and let the dresses sides fly free. \n",
      "The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist had some real hits on his hands with pieces like a printed blouse with slashed full sleeves (shown with another pair of hot pants), and his fabrications remain among the strongest of New York Citys young guns. While impeccable textiles and techniques arent always fully appreciable on the runway, Gelinass guests milled around post-show, admiring the Italian blossom-print fils coup jacquard, shorn and married to an underlayer of black organza, and the dense, all-over embroidery that gave a certain toughness to his flounced miniskirt. The designer showed a similar skirt for Fall 2015, but still, this collection felt a far cry from that seasons nicely austere homage to American workwear. Here there was a certain, albeit very modern, primness; you felt it in the buttoned-up shirts; whittled, cropped pant legs; and circle skirts. At times, perhaps, it was a bit more controlled than vulnerable; you wanted to see Gelinass muse come just a bit more undone. These clothes had a beautiful womanliness to them, though. Gelinass wholesale business is a relatively new one (he has a loyal base of private customers, and now stockists that include Fivestory New York, Shopbop.com, and L.A.s Guerilla Atelier): You got the sense its only going to grow in the months to come.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Chalayan,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Im a very curious person, said Hussein Chalayan backstage. Hes right about that, in both senses. For only an inquiring mindand a very particular attitudecould have formulated the fabulous coup de thtre at the heart of this mornings Chalayan presentation.\n",
      "Upon entering the show space, two models could be seen wearing white paper dresses with military detailing, standing in some kind of glassless vitrine. The audience checked them out, then blanked them out: They werent doing much, just standing there. The show proceeded. As soon as the first bespoke cigar-holder pocket at the chest of an olive green military-style skirt-dress appeared, it became apparent this was an extension of Chalayans most recent Cuban-themed menswear collection. And, indeed, there were some looks from that outing sprinkled among the pliss skirts that were printed with abstracted pie charts from the CIA Factbook on Cuba, the cute Plonk cartoon character Chalayan found in the British Library and transported to his muse nation, and the neutral-toned dancer-and-trumpeter brocade. For some reason the soundtrack was a medley of a woman moaning in suggestive ecstasy and the Knight Rider theme song: unlikely bedfellows. The clothes were precise and complicated and sometimes very beautiful. Each model wore rope-tied shoes whose heel was an on-its-side cylinderone of these heels detached early in the show and rolled forlornly to a halt as its wearer walked on.\n",
      "Then came the splash. Those two paper-dress-wearing models tensed. Two hidden showerheads above them suddenly gushed forth. Andwhoa!the paper dresses literally melted away as the water doused them, revealing crystal-flashed, palm-pattern party dresses beneath. It was amazing to watch. The models, one of them shivering, walked the runway and left a slick of water behind them.\n",
      "Afterward, the very curious Mr. Chalayan explained the sleight of dress thusly: That was to represent the transformation of a militant kind of situation [in Cuba] to a more playful one. I liked the idea of using water. Because, of course, Cuba, theres a sea. So I thought how could I fuse these ideas together. And I liked the idea of a garment that could melt and reveal something else underneath. And it was, of course, crystal embellished because our sponsor was Swarovski. So we had these dancing palm trees, and the crystals were their coconuts. It was a real challenge, to be honest. A lot of back and forth. Girls slipping, as you saw, and heels breaking, but who cares? I like taking risks. Original, curious, and intelligent, Chalayan is a designer to cherish.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Chanel,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"See Chanel and fly? As much as the foreign members of the audience might wish, thats not quite the case, since there are still 24 Paris hours to go till the Spring shows are over. Still, women of all nations were amused to check in ahead of time at the Chanel airport terminal Karl Lagerfeld installed in the Grand Palais. It provided a funny enhanced-reality replica of a situation we all know only too well: the one where we watch everyone else milling around, busy on their ways with their rolling suitcases, their tracksuits, and contra-freeze in-flight comfort sweaters, their practical flats for walking the endless corridors to baggage claim, and the crucial sunglasses for the jet-lagged arrival. Only, of course, all this is considerably upgraded: Its the idea of how it should look! quipped Lagerfeld.\n",
      "It is strange to see Chanel taking over the flight controls the day after a dispute between Air France and its workers came to an ugly head over falling business and layoffs. Instead, here was Chanel putting the best and most globally appreciated face of France forward, and laying out an array of products that will most certainly fly off the racks at duty-free and in all cities where the house has boutiques. Chanel has been most careful to clock up its air miles in customer-care outreach in the past couple of years: The destinations indicated on the Grand Palais departure boardSingapore, Dubai, Seoul, Tokyoare all cities where Lagerfeld and co. have taken the double-C traveling show to first-class customers.\n",
      "And what will this well-traveled international clientele be taking onboard from this particular show? Bits and pieces from all over the concourse, no doubta Chanel range that runs from the witty and kitsch (Chanel hard-case wheelie carry-on bags, Teva-type sandals with tweed straps and flashing runway-landing lights running around the soles), takes off in the ironic, insider trophy (70s leisure jackets, plane-patterned tricolor intarsia cashmere sweaters, and a flash of Laura Ashleyesque puff-sleeved denim), and then lands amid sparkling splendor. The twinkling herringbone jackets and shell tops, paved in crystal and decorated with fat, black ribbon bows, are quintessentially, timelessly Chanel, nothing to do with noveltyyet also, in their way, an accessory rather than an outfit. In the congested skies of fashion, Captain Karl is one person who knows how to navigate Chanel in all the right directions.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Chlo,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"The 1990s is one of Springs big stories, but no one has put forward her interest in the decade more explicitly than Clare Waight Keller at Chlo. On every seat, there was a printed note: This seasons collection is a tribute to girls named Kate, Chlo, Cecilia, Corinne, Rosemary, Emma, and Courtney, who embody the liberty and the elegance of a perfectly mastered and excessively lived simplicity. Backstage, the designer explained she grew up alongside that motley crew of models, photographers, and superstar performers. For Waight Keller, they represent a freer time: Theres such a fast pace to fashion now; I think weve lost the innocence of the spirit of fashion, the youthful optimism that it portrays. And I think theres something quite joyful about fashion thats been missing. \n",
      "In keeping with that sentiment, she imbued the new collection with a playful spirit, quite literally in the case of the rave-girl tracksuit separates she started with. Athleisure is something different for Chlo, and it was most convincing when Waight Keller combined a split-hem track pant with a romantic, off-the-shoulder shirt typical of the brand. As the show progressed, it took on more of those familiar Chlo tropesfestival dresses, peasant tops, lacy little bandeaux and miniskirtsbut never lost its 90s leanings. The denim separates were oversize and frayed. Overallsin trouser and dress formconjured images of raves gone by, too. There were even Hammer (as in MC) pants. All of which will likely play exceedingly well with young women who missed out on them the first time around. \n",
      "Waight Keller had Georgina Grenville, Cecilia Chancellor, and Angela Lindvall representing the 90s in the front row, but what a kick it wouldve been to see them on the runway in these clothes. Youthful optimism is wasted on the young.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Christian Dior,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"There were mountains of delphiniums shipped in to decorate the Dior tent and mountains of people clogging the Rue de Rivoli entrance, jostling for a glimpse of Rihanna. Inside, though? There was Raf Simons backstage, talking about keeping things simple and quiet: Its a calm one, and very softaway from the overdone. I didnt want to embellish. So I was thinking about the South of Francerainbows and the simple things. And theres a bit of Victoriana: something of that film Picnic at Hanging Rock. With a slight sexual undertone of darkness.\n",
      "Simons can lay reasonable claim to have been the one to start both the current Victoriana-nightdress trend and the intergalactic astronaut trends that are running through so many collections this seasonhe proposed both themes in his Spring 2015 ready-to-wear show. But part of the responsibility for helming a behemoth brand like Christian Dior is filling stores with daywear for women who like feminine things rather than conceptual clothes, and this season he attended to servicing it. \n",
      "His solution was to pair scallop-edged handkerchief cotton dresses, little shorts, and bodices with black tailoring. The jacketssoftened from the corseted New Look hourglassskimmed the body and broke into bands of micro pleats at the hem, a masculine-feminine merge suggesting the techniques that went into the trains of Victorian and Edwardian dresses. The sexual undertone? Not so much in the clothes as at the necks, which were bound with tight scarves and chokers, each carrying a single jewel and dangling a metal tag, some of which read 1947, the date of Diors revolutionary New Look collection. In terms of fashion, though, there was nothing very disturbing or challenging in any of this. Deliberately so: In a season where many collections have apparently neglected to remember that there might be warm weather in 2016, Dior is one place where fresh summer options will be found.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Christian Siriano,Dan Thawley,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"The North African playground of Morocco is oft-mined territory for fashion designers: Its exotic textiles and rich cultural landscape stole the heart of Yves Saint Laurent, and Alber Elbaz paid homage to the ancient land (also his birthplace) for Lanvins sumptuous Fall 2015 show. But fast-forward a generation or two to New York Citybased designer Christian Siriano, whose Spring 2016 show mapped a fantasy road trip taking in Casablanca, Marrakech, Tangier, and Fez through his glamorous West Coast lens. It was about the dream of Morocco. I researched traditional interiors and architecture, including many different mosques, said Siriano. He stripped back the vibrant palette of the Berbers in favor of optic white, blush, and sandy-toned silks cut into his signature structured shifts and a slew of floaty tunics matched with pencil skirts or fluid palazzo pants.\n",
      "Amid the flounce of handkerchief hems and cocktail dresses in body-con knit, Siriano applied an intricate textural play of pom-poms, fringing, and a geometric tiled jacquard that reflected his inspiration with a somewhat heavy hand. Later on, he tipped the scales in his favor when translating those tropes into the more familiar territory of eveningwear, where pleated goddess gowns and a frothy tulle pinafore injected a welcome lightness. It is from those looks that Sirianos front row fixtures Christina Hendricks and Orange Is the New Black star Laura Prepon might choose their next red carpet moment: a marabou-flecked ball skirt perhaps, or one of the gowns encrusted in scalloped peach sequins. Despite their couture touch, even those showstoppers paled in comparison to four finale looks that emerged with satin trains in eye-watering pastel silksthose were the welcome color shock this collection needed from the get-go.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Christian Wijnants,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"I wanted something very airy, very light, very easyand quite minimal as well, said Christian Wijnants at his presentation today. Well, consider that job done. But . . . hold on . . . presentation? Wijnants has stepped off the runway. He said this was a result of the opening of his first flagship store, in Antwerp, a project that has been dominating his time.\n",
      "Hmm. Hmmmmm. Well, whatever the reason, the absence of a runway proved no greatly significant obstruction to the delivery of this collection. Wijnants said he had been thinking about Brancusi, and there was some correlation to that evident in the irregular lumpen-ness, hinting at distorted symmetry, in his fil coupe applications. More broadly though, this was an efficient but not especially uplifting compilation of contemporary fashion tropes. The strongest pieces included a tightly fringed kicky jumpsuit, and a blouse fronted with frayed panels of clothes that transformed the canvas pants obscured beneath them into the viable foundation of an evening look. Fil coupe suiting printed with a tonal monkey relief motif, frayed panel cotton viscose knit tees, some linen-lined scuba-foam hot pants, and fringing galore on denim-chambray separates were all fine and dandy. It was interesting, though, how the transplantation of this collection from runway to showroom rather sucked the oomph out of it. This collection was full of solidly tasteful left-field pieces, but there was not a great deal to get properly excited about here.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Christopher Kane,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Last season, she discovered sex said Christopher Kane. Now shes crazy in love! Kanes work is always about who he is, where he comes from, and what hes experiencing at the time. And some of the creative connections he makes are through language. The word crazy is the one with the emotional double meaning which set him off this time. Our life has been a bit of a car-crash recently, he remarked, in a preview at his studio. He did not spell out why that is, but he and his family have been dealing with the recent loss of their mother and of Christophers mentor in the past year or so. Thus the imagery of car-wrecks, fractured shapes, jagged cutouts, and spray-painting filtered into his dresses and tailoring.\n",
      "Perhaps it was his raw state of mind that led him to look at the instinctive, unfiltered nature of outsider art, a train of thought that led him to apply naive hand-stitched motifs to sweaters and leather coats, and to apply frayed white chiffon frills to collars and pockets. Another sideways leap made Kane think about mental institutions and medical science, hence the woman in the blue shirt, banded with wipe-clean plastic cuffs and a strict skirt: Like a nurse whos going to give you a lethal injection!\n",
      "Belaboring explanations is never the way to understand Christopher Kane, though. Getting him is always a case of whether you appreciate his electric fusion of weirdness and chic. There were jolts of that sort of current running through the detailsnarrow plastic restraint tags on black silk dresses, worn as chokers and decorating bags; a reprise of Kanes signature neon lace in even sicker combinations of orange, yellow, and lime; and funny envelope clutches cut in the shape of cartoon explosions. Fun, odd and elegant by turns, this was a show which covered a lot of bases. No matter what life has been throwing at him, it proved that Christopher Kane is a solid designer.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Christopher Raeburn,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"Ladies, heres a dating tip: Go out with guys like Christopher Raeburn. This is an analysis based entirely on Raeburns design ethos, but it doubles as a pretty good laundry list of things to look for in a man. 1) Raeburn has integrity, as demonstrated in his commitment to utilizing upcycled and locally sourced materials and vegetable dyes like the ones used in the silk floral prints in his latest collection. 2) Raeburn is a true team player, on the evidence of the two collaborations he unveiled this seasonchunky sandals made with Clarks, and knits produced with the house Knyttan. 3) Hes romantic yet practical: Note the standout accessory at Raeburns show this afternoon, a hand-tied jacquard fanny pack. Nuff said.\n",
      "Really, though, the main reason to go out with a guy like Christopher Raeburn is that Christopher Raeburn is as excited about the things a woman does as the way a woman looks. Purely on the level of aesthetics, this was by far Raeburns most compelling womenswear showhe finally got a firm handle on feminine cuts and codes. But Raeburn arrived at that breakthrough courtesy of his theme, an homage to intrepid female explorers that summoned both a pioneer spirit and a sense of authority. For all the sheer diaphanousness of a dress in patchworked olive drab parachute silk, for instance, the look still communicated vigor and potency. Seriously, date a guy who understands that softness and strength are not opposing values.\n",
      "Raeburn evinced that understanding again and again in these clothes. There was a certain tenderness to his basket-weave fil coupes, made from strips of old air-break parachute fabric and either overdyed black or left plain. But Raeburn used the textile in silhouettes that were matter of fact, like a wrapped tunic and long skirt, or a pair of low-slung, wide-leg trousers. Elsewhere, transparent materials or his vegetable-dyed floral print introduced that tender note. Other looks had a harder, more graphic edge, in particular the printed gray jersey and olive drab cotton pieces, but he muted the blunt effect by hewing to shapes that, though tailored, were relaxed. Raeburn has suddenly become very good at mixing his tones, and creating garments that feel multidimensional. His clothes were distinctive, but not defining. A woman wearing them could feel utterly herself and confident about lighting out for new territory. Date a guy like Christopher Raeburn. Or you know what? If youd rather, feel free to go it alone.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Clover Canyon,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"The humble weed is finally getting its moment in the spotlight. Inspired by their ability to survive in urban environments against all odds, Rozae Nichols turned her Spring collection into what she called a celebration of the mightiness of these hard-to-kill plants and their knack for breaking their way through cracks in cement. Nichols, whose brand launched in 2011, quickly found success with her digital floral prints, which have been stamped on a growing list of categories that now includes shoes and swimwear. But this season the designer seemed to want to branch out in a new direction. Her best pieceslike a color-blocked cami dress or topwerent printed at all but embellished with hand-stitched laser-cut flowers, part of Nicholss aim to push her signature florals into the third dimension. The palettesalmon pink with lavender, dusty rose with brown, navy with golden yellowlent everything a delightful jolie laide vibe. Nichols has also been training her customer to seek solids from the label; the cropped, colorful flares will certainly further her efforts.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Co,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Co is a brand based in Los Angeles. Until now, though, the collections that Co honchos Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern produced havent been particularly suggestive of the placetheres always been an idiomatically Californian sense of ease to Cos clothes, but its been overshadowed by a tone of Old World soign. (And sometimes a certain cloudy-weather moodiness, too.) This season, however, Kern and Danan took inspiration from their surroundings, lightening up their collection both literally and tonally, and tipping their hat to the local landscape with palm-frond motifs and fabrics that conjured a distant ocean view.\n",
      "What Cos new materials lacked in weight they made up for in richness: The lavish materials included a palm-patterned mesh jacquard, a wave-textured 3-D-printed viscose, and, most gorgeous of all, a white chiffon flecked with devor velvet. A keyhole-collared maxi dress in the fabric was one of the collections understated standouts. Elsewhere, there were simple button-down blouses with high-drama collars, tailored frocks with bouffant skirts, handknit cotton sweaters, and a bevy of A-line and Peter Pancollared looks that referenced high-end mod.\n",
      "The big sellers, though, will be Cos expanded range of denim done in collaboration with Franois Girbaud: As well as introducing new silhouettes in the raw Japanese denim currently flying out of stores, Kern and Danan debuted a version of their best-selling flares in off-white cotton canvas. Emboldened, perhaps, by the Girbaud collaborations success, Co has embarked on two new ones. The terrific hats in the lookbook were done in partnership with milliner Fil, and the sunglasses are Co by Jacques Marie Mage. Altogether, the clothes and accessories made for a very Co take on L.A.: Hollywood glam as reimagined by Truffaut or Fellini, perhaps.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Coach,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Stuart Vevers walks to work at Coach along the High Line every day, lucky thing. The aerial park, with its grasses and fig trees and urban butterflies, tracks across the west side of Manhattan as one of the most joyously human examples of industrial repurposing in our times. The new Coach offices are under construction near the end of the High Line at 30th Street, as it happens, and it was adjacent to that location, on a perfectly sunny September afternoon, that the company invited the press, buyers, and celebrities to step along the old railway tracks and into a temporary grass-planted space to see the first big runway show Coach has staged for New York Fashion Week.\n",
      "As it also happens, 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Coach, So, said Vevers, it felt like a good moment to show we have confidence. The values of Coach have always been purely American and pragmatic, a company proud to fulfill everyday needs. But in the 21st century, Vevers is one of those designers who questions how, and whether, that democratic ideal in fashion is reaching young people at attainable prices, and in ways that will excite them. His answer was to think about a magpie girl who goes on road trips, picking up Western things, but also might steal from her grannys closet on the Upper East Side.\n",
      "If so, granny was a bit of a 70s bohemian, because this girls dresses were all made from micro-floral multicolored patchworks, though they were definitely a lot shorter than they were at Woodstock, and with an easily relatable pull-on-and-go attitude about them. Still, Vevers is not someone who will go off on narrative raptures about fictional muses. Refreshingly, hes a down-to-earth product designer who is good at thinking about such things as what a functional cut-down cowboy boot should look like for a customers money: i.e., comfortable, with a lot of collaged fun thrown into the bargain. I dont think Ive ever put a heel on the runway at Coach, he said, laughing. I just want to make it feel light in spirit and bring some joy to it, and maybe a sense of the American outdoors.\n",
      "It worked. Coach is, of course, a great American bag companyand there were plenty of respectfully traditional saddle-leather hobo shapes reprised in the showbut it also needs to convert a new generation to its faith. And, oddly, on the High Line today it felt as if Stuart Vevers, an Englishman abroad, is the person who might be able to see exactly how to do that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Comme des Garons Comme des Garons,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"The cult of Comme is a complicated micro-society shadowed by layers of lines within. Beneath apex-Commeand what a truly incredible collection Rei Kawakubo showed this weekthere is the Comme des Garons commercial collection that never sees the light of runway but that the buyers flock to postshow. Boy, the showroom was rammed today. Below, significantly below, there is Comme Shirt (kinda my favorite in terms of buy-to-wear), Comme Girl, and probably several others hidden away in the Comme-citadel on Place Vendme of which most people have probably never heard. Comme des Commethis collectioninhabits a welcome sweet spot between haute Comme and Girl. It is the go-to uniform for Comme acolytes: These are the clothes of the disciples.\n",
      "Todays collection contained an interesting mlange of the rustic and the historical, shot through with the white-and-navy overtones of seifuku (old-school Japanese school uniform lifted from French sailor suits), that seem so ingrained in the Comme unconscious. The cut-away angle beneath the two buttons on a nylon/polyester jacket (CdGCdG is a master of mustering richness in synthetics) spoke loudly of early19th century military tailoringlook at portraits of Lord Nelson. The rough, gently pleated linen shift and smock dresses whispered of a Thomas Hardy-ish, bucolic vision of the tenant farmers wife. There were even pantaloons, worn over the usual Repetto uwabaki. This was a carefully and poignantly rendered articulation of the ascetic aesthetic of Comme: slow fashion for deep thinkers. Dreamy.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Comme des Garons,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Rei Kawakubo has cast a spell over her audience. The fashion community strives to keep believing that fashion can touch deeper meanings in this time of often bewildering industrial change, and she's the one people turn to for some kind of emotional stimulus that goes beyond the blunt service of commerce. Once more this season, she again blocked the expectation that she would offer anything recognizable as clothes. Instead she mounted a monumental sculptural meditation on Blue Witches, a coda further explained by her husband Adrian Joffe as Powerful women who are misunderstood, but do good in the world.\n",
      "Was she talking about herself? Comme des Garons, as a retail operation, has grown against all odds as an independent multibrand chain which buys young designers, whom Kawakubo personally approves, and sells their work in branches in Tokyo, New York, and London. They definitely regard her as a woman with magical transformative powers who they hold in awe. In those stores, meanwhile, Kawakubos own conceptual collections reappear in simpler, wearable forms, right down to ranges of T-shirts which indicate her original runway styles in cool ways.\n",
      "Whether or not that qualifies Kawakubo as a literal Witch, it can safely be predicted that the ideas she put forth on her Spring runaway will make their way, in far more accessible forms, to her shops all over the word. That surely gives her the right to go as experimental and extreme as she did this season.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Comptoir des Cotonniers,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"All around Paris, the Comptoir des Cotonniers ads featuring Charlotte Gainsbourg and her daughter Alice catch the eye without imposing upon it. Fresh into her second season, creative director Anne Valrie Hash said the Fall suiting and new Slash sneaker are outperforming expectations. As for her Spring collection, her enthusiasm radiated through the brands showroom. First, she presented an all-white grouping: a tuxedo-style blazer and trousers, and a slouchier pullover with rolled-cuff pants. Next, she made the case for military-inspired jackets paired with ingenue base layers. Hash seemed especially excited to reveal Comptoirs partnership with J Brand (both are part of Fast Retailings roster) and the resulting denim range.\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, the sneakers will return, this time in denim, gray jersey, and floral-printed leather. She showed how small details such as knits with deep side slits make a big difference in how the clothes can be worn. And once summer arrives, a new cotton-viscose blend dubbed Ma Double Peau (My Second Skin) will solve the summer-weight sweater woes. Dresseslong patchwork white lace with a drawstring waist; a flimsy embroidered and printed slipmarked the seasons apogee. Yet when Hash singled out the well-proportioned overcoats (neither too boxy nor too slim) and the hickory stripe slacks, noting that they could have been worn 10 years ago and could likely be worn 10 years from now, she revealed how smoothly shes integrated the Comptoir spirit with her own. Overall, she seemed well aware that maintaining momentum is as simple as keeping things simple.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Costume National,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Seventies, 80s, 90s. Any which way you cut it, fashion is in the midst of a vintage moment. Whats a born and bred minimalist to do? Costume National designer Ennio Capasa, to his credit, isnt changing his tune. Hes been around too long for that, a fact he likes to emphasize on his mood board, labeling images from his past with their season and year.\n",
      "For Spring 2016, he doubled down on the tailoring hes long been associated with and streamlined his color palette. Backstage he said he focused on fabric development to create sensuality. Glitter pinstripes, polka-dot fil coupe, and suede laser-cut to look like lace made appearances. A minidress as silvery as tinsel was gathered at one shoulder with a silk ribbon. Still, you couldnt help but feel Capasa preferred the simplicity of basic black or white, which he used more than anything else here, perhaps because it put nothing extraneous in the way of his tailoring. This season his suiting had a somewhat softer, more feminine sensibility than it has in the past. Ruffles cascaded down the front of a vest and metal rings connected the front and back panels on jackets, leaving a suggestive slice of shoulder exposed. Minor developments. A single red pantsuit worn with a sheer red turtleneck underneath made a lasting impression, but otherwise this collection couldve used more spark.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Courrges,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"Does the world need another heritage brand? Probably not. Do women outside of France have any special feeling for Courrges? Unlikely. But any doubts about Sbastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillants efforts to revive Andr Courrgess space-age label were quickly dispelled by their show this morning. The LVMH Prize finalists, who put their fledgling line, Coperni Femme, on hold to focus on this endeavor, made a clever debut. Their trick was to get down to basics.\n",
      "As the pair said when they came out onstage to introduce the collectiona charming performance that was a novelty in and of itselfthe show had no total looks. Instead there were iconic Courrges items tweaked for 2016 shoppers15 in all, and each one available in a range of 15 different materials. That kind of variety will be a boon to retailers, which tend to want items unique to their stores. And it was refreshing to see young designers focused so clearly on commerce, especially in a season when others have been creatively flummoxed by new responsibilities at the historic brands theyve inherited. \n",
      "The show felt a bit like Courrges 101, what with the steady progression from the houses familiar cropped jacket in a crinkly patent to miniskirts, A-line shifts, and cropped pants in such materials as suede, techno knits, and patchworked leather. The foundation for every piece was a white ribbed knit bodysuit that Meyer and Vaillant could spin out in a dozen directions next season if they choose to. \n",
      "Courrgess owners, Jacques Bungert and Frdric Torloting, planned this launch just about perfectly. The late 60s and early 70s have been trending on the runways since Nicolas Ghesquire landed at Louis Vuitton. Julien Dossena has done a bang-up job of breathing new life into Paco Rabanne, whose work shares similarities with that of Courrges. Timing counts. The faster this foursome can get these pieces in shops and online, the better.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Creatures of Comfort,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Spring found Jade Lai in conversation with Le Corbusier. The Creatures of Comfort designer was looking at the storied mid-century architect and his prolific, elemental legacy. After a stay at his Brutalist Marseille masterwork, the Radiant City, it seems the pair struck up a natural repartee.\n",
      "Lais collection opened with a grouping of graphic prints in jolie laide color combos: The first look was a shirtdress in blocky black, red, white, and pale yellow. It was bold, to be sure. Elsewhere that mood manifested itself even more vividly, as with a sheeny, cherry-red tank dress layered under knit shorts in an equally punchy shade of the same color. Among other standouts were the closing pair of looks, liquid-looking cupro pieces, rawly appliqud with designs inspired by Le Corbusiers drawings. The architect would no doubt have approved of Lais take on off-shouldernot some festival-ready style, gauzy and hanging from the collarbone, but a graphic, straight-across, chicly seductive version. Styled beneath a knit slip dress, it felt in step with the runways recent mood.\n",
      "What was particularly notable about these pieces, though, was their sophisticated brand of commercial appealscarcely anything looked daunting to style. Denim was particularly strong here; Lai had expanded her explorations with the stuff since Resort, and she may well have the ultimate high-rise flare on her hands. Whats more elemental than dreamy blue jeans?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Creatures of the Wind,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"When does something thats come and gone come back into fashion? Creatures of the Winds Christopher Peters asked backstage before the labels Spring 2016 show, and during a moment when fashion-conscious girls everywhere reach into their closets to pull out everything from 20s tea dresses to orange-tab-bearing Levi's 501s and sleek contemporary suiting, its certainly a worthy question. For Peters and design partner Shane Gabier, it became a way to create a pastiche of all of their favorite things in their latest collection, from cropped motorcycle jackets with seams co-opted from 40s corsetry to bias-cut skirts, 30s slip dresses, and glam rockinspired denim. As it processed by on the runway, it had the not-entirely-unappealing feeling of a yard sale attended by punky young femmes with bouffant hairdos and fishnet tights.\n",
      "This being Creatures of the Wind, the winsome 70s were never far behind, whether spotted in the densely floral-embroidered miniskirts and crocheted vests or the chunky-heeled, hand-painted snakeskin slingbacks that alternated mostly with slip-on sneakers designed in tandem with APL. And while theres certainly something to be said for culling all the best bits from the current trendsfrom a silky wallpaper-patterned cotton jacquard and a wispy silk-cut floral dvor slip of a frock to trouser legs and tunic hems replete with ring-pull zips for ones own adjustmentsthe most winning looks felt truest to Creatures of the Winds own sense of charm: cheeky, trim knits paired with sloping skirts and an army jacket emblazoned with a hammered silver floral motif, the type of treasure that can become both utterly trend-resistant and just the ticket for weathering spring. The designers choice to begin and end the show with a suitthe first in block-print linen, the last in black cotton sateen, worn with a flowing ivory and metallic-striped pleated dress and trousers that ended mid-calf in a thick, wide cuffproved a happy accident: Its where we are, said Peters, pointing at the run of show, and thats where were going.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Cushnie et Ochs,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"As nineties fashion references go, hip-hop gets short shrift. Grunge keeps coming back; so do nods to original Helmut Lang. But the hip-hop aesthetic, which had such a resounding impact on mainstream style, is reinterpreted comparatively rarely on luxury fashion runways. Thats changingsome of the kids who grew up on hip-hop are fully formed designers nowbut still, it was striking to see Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochss homage to the look at their show today.\n",
      "Ochs and Cushnie came at hip-hop via the work of painter Kehinde Wiley, famed for his Baroque-style portraits of black men clad in the everyday garb they wear on the street. Wiley made for an interesting bridge, inasmuch as the reference to his work allowed the designers to play with tropes for which they clearly have a great deal of affectionnote the baggy pants and bandanas, pleasewhile simultaneously giving their collection a sense of hauteur.\n",
      "This was, relative to previous Cushnie et Ochs outings, a very ladylike collection. That tone was evident especially in the color palette, which erred toward Easter-egg pastels, but it was also reflected in the number of rather demure silhouettes. There was skin, to be surebest seen from the back, in the apron-style openings of certain tops and dressesbut the duos signature pencil dresses were not so much body-con, this season, as classically form-fit. There were a lot of feminine grace notes here as well, like the little flutter of a ruffle edging one yellow frock, or a scarf collar on another dress in seafoam green. Other elements, such as black leather and bright gold buttons or zips, introduced a harder edge. Cushnie and Ochs were onto something interesting, using a reference typically perceived as tough to soften up their signature look, and in so doing, elevating it a great deal. They should make a habit of thinking that way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Custo Barcelona,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Custo Dalmau called his Spring collection Slow, which appeared to be a bit of a misnomer at first, because the head-on collision of prints, colors, and textures felt more like a frenzy.\n",
      "Actually, the collections name is an homage to slow cooking, of all things, which the show notes defined as a culinary movement that rejects the standardization of taste. Dalmau wanted to go against the current, he said, defying the pull of fast fashion and deliberately designing pieces that would require painstaking and time-consuming work. One open-work vest was assembled like a puzzle, from different pieces of fabric that had been cut into geometrical shapes. Backstage one could admire the impressive handiwork, but on the runway it was hard to notice because, between the contrasting car-wash-pleat skirts, color-saturated dresses layered over slinky striped flares, and embroidered patchwork contraptions, there was simply too much going on. The collection would have benefited if Dalmau had subtracted a few ingredients; that way we could have savored the unique taste of each piece.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Cynthia Rowley,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Perennially sunny, Cynthia Rowley was feeling especially so today in the airy, white-walled expanse of her new West Village headquarters, for intense planning on multiple fronts had come to fruition. The surf-inspired video showcasing her Spring collection was in the can, as they say; her Rowley Fitness lineloaded with wetsuitshad arrived; her new furniture line was on the way; and a home fragrance was in the works. But most painstaking of all had been the HQ itself. Bought a year ago and exhaustively renovated (It looked like the water-logged insides of the Titanic, quipped the designer), it was also finished, or very nearly so, down to the Instagram-friendly gold door painted on the outside. The space will double as a kind of community center, she said, with yoga classes and everything.\n",
      "But if Rowley seemed exhausted (she didnt), she was only feigning it. She is forever looking and moving forward. Her Spring collection exemplified this willful cheer, with its splashes of sequins in floral patterns, bursts of metallic tinsel trim, tufts of fluttery shredded chiffon, comfy knits, bold twill appliqus, and studs the size of saucers. A colorful, 60s-style worldliness prevailed. Shapes were roomy and breezy think caftans, jumpsuits, A-lines, and mini kimonos, all sashed liberally. Accessories, too, were shiny and happy, in particular, cat-eye sunglasses and a large beaded necklace that looked straight out of a Frida Kahlo self-portrait. Now there was a woman with cheerful resilience. \n",
      "Rowley is an avid surfer as are her daughters, hence the wave-riding theme of the video, which will debut tonight in an immersive installation that, thanks to drone technology, all but plops the viewer beachside. It was touch-and-go, though. As a storm moved in the day of the shoot, Rowley sprang into action and got the cast and crew out to Montauk earlier than planneda triumph of logistical will, to be sure. What can I say? she chirped. Im a pathological optimist.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Daks,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"Sure, Daks was born in London, shows in London, and maintains a retail home on Jermyn Streetthe greatest old-school menswear thoroughfare in the world. Those British roots, though, have become a mere backstory for a house that thrives in Asia and most especially in Japan, where its owners are based. Today the brands creative director, Filippo Scuffi, delivered an assured portfolio of conservatively au courant womenswear that avoided the painful Anglophile bombast that has marked some of Dakss most recent shows.\n",
      "The catwalk was plastered in marble-patterned paper and lined with chrome-effect cladding as if to resemble the Art Deco foyer of some grand 1920s hotel. Along it unfolded a collection that played with some tropes of that time. There were flapperish chiffon dresses, marble-print pants, and a pleasant recurring diamond relief Scuffi had sourced from a bolt of wallpaper printed in 1925. Yet this lineup roamed confidently beyond one particular theme. There were some deftly handled plays on trad gents fabrics rebooted as feminine, masculine shirting detailing emphasized on silk blouses, and brogues that were transformed into double-strap high heels.\n",
      "Rust, the key color in Dakss historic check, translated nicely into a slouchy suede patch-pocket skirt, a shirtdress, and scrunchily tactile bombers. A pleat-heavy riff on chiffon dresses and blouses printed with iterations of that wallpaper pattern in teal and purple were well-executed takes on the Royal Tenenbaums-influenced Pucci/Gucci/Prada reappropriation of soft 70s kookiness. Most meh-heavy was a climactic evening section whose various grand gestures of volume or length seemed out of sync, at least to this eye. Backstage, Scuffi pointed out that one recurring printa washed-out botanical X-rayhad been a special request from Asia. And when a designer is thinking so hard about one particular market, it seems churlish to complain that his collection isnt perfect for another.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Damir Doma,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"The plaintive refrain that rings through Milan every Fashion Week goes thus: Where are all the young designers? Who's got a different voice? So although he's a transfer from Paris, the arrival of Damir Doma is something for locals to relish. He's a jolt of beard-scratchy thoughtfulness in a town whose fashion business is gripped by the sleek; a bit of spiritual underground to offset all the commercial overground.\n",
      "Doma held his first Italian womenswear show in two adjacent garages behind Via Torino, which gave it that most blessed of elements, outdoor space. On a rough-and-ready catwalk of chipped concrete, the designer showed some comely new variations on his severe and monastic metier. Crisp papery cottonin all-white, checks, or darkened navy strafed by stripeswas melded into restrainedly asymmetrical shapes given depth by fold and knot. A loose micro-check overcoat was satisfyingly gathered by a looped closure. The burnt-out opaque jumpsuits were a touch iffyhad the unreconstructed testosterone that courses through Milan dosed DD?but the same fabric incorporated into patched degrad black trousers worked well. A fil coupe of distressed abstract shapes was deeply Doma: palely interesting, austere, moody. It suits this designer to be close to the production of his clothes, and it suits this city to host him.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,David Koma,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Shallow castellations of ruffle encircled floating corsets, apparently boned by silver zippers that were the recurring chorus of this collection. Armor-like of aspect and surely ideal for the encouragement of positive posture, these topped the skinny pants and fluting skirts corralled by David Koma into what he said was a loose meditation on contemporary dance. Folded strips of tulle wound tight around the body on fitted monochrome dresses or hung slacker on a dress of barely pink, neoprene-lined napa with unzippable sections in its organza-lined skirt.\n",
      "Swarovski gridding had the tough ornateness of a samurai breastplate on closing looks that reasserted the ruffle-topped corsetry. A sheer skirt angled away from a matte black leather sports bra to make an incongruously funereal Empire-line dress. Every detail, whether languid ruffles, a mushrooming gather, or a remixed neckline, appeared as intensely wrought and thought out as the most grueling dance routine: And it is this relish that lends Komas work such a powerful signature.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,David Michael,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 12, 2015\",\"Is novelty always necessary? There are only subtle changes to be found between David Michaels collections, but thanks to the near-perfection of his louche tailoring, manythis reporter includedare all too happy to see him staying his chosen course of badass basics. The fine finishing, softly rakish fabrics, and general minutiae may be lost in the context of a lookbook, but are impressed upon you straight away on seeing Michaels wares in person (find them, for example, at Totokaelos massive new Soho digs, where they hang alongside the likes of Haider Ackermann). According to Michael's origin story, his grasp of patternmaking and how clothes hang came to him in a dream, and indeed, that innateness seems to translate into the ease of every garment, from staples like slouchy pull-on pants and menswear-inspired toppers, to more out-and-out sensual pieces like Springs hyper-languid jumpsuit. Michael infused his signature shapes with a little witchy glamour, too, thanks to a glossy black jacket that gave major shades of The Hunger.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Delpozo,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"One imagines that Josep Fonts mind might be a lovely place to spend some time. Theres an anachronistic quality to the designers brand of demi-couture as he has established it in his three years at the Spanish heritage house Delpozo. His romanticism and unreservedly fairy-tale brand of femininity hearken back to another time, and the designer has a love of dressing women thats palpable. \n",
      "For Spring, Fonts women were those of Federico Garca Lorcas Gypsy Ballads and Emilie Flge, muse to Gustav Klimt and, in fact, a fashion designer herself who envisioned proto-bohemian styles far ahead of her time. Many a creative director has name-checked Flge in the past, but rather than appearing merely as a vessel for Klimts famous aesthetic, here Font found a grounding force in Flges love of folklore, and the similarly earthy qualities to be found in Lorcas famous book. Font, whose work so often has an almost synthetically confectionary tenor to it, incorporated those craftier elements into his vernacular in rich and compelling ways. Take a stunning hand-crocheted long raffia vest, or that same material brought to life in a massive icy blue belted wrap. Pieces like that served as textural, welcome foils to Fonts most purely extravagant looks.\n",
      "If otherworldly volumes are a signature of his tenure with Delpozo thus far, then the larger-than-life shirtdress in a metallic palm jacquard with tiers of generous ruffles, or a sheer pannier-like miniskirt, surely pushed even Fonts own boundaries (the fabric of the former came to life beautifully and more quietly as a fringed wrap over white trousers). A grouping of polka-dotted pieces early on and a long rounded skirt in graphic orange and blue scrollwork could surely have been cut from the collection, since their sharpness felt so at odds with the ethereal ideas Font proposed elsewhere. A blue and pink moire frock served as an especially vivid testament to Delpozo fantasia at its best, and contrasted nicely with the houses first move into purses, a chicly boxy doctors bag.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dennis Basso,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"For decades, Dennis Basso has enjoyed a loyal customer base of great dames and society women. But recently the designer has been refocusing his collections to entice a new clientele. The whole look this year, it appeals to a younger woman, said Basso backstage. Its very youthful and vibrant, and its all about the cities south of the borderCaracas, Acapulco, Rio. But it was a subtle, modern Latin flavor Basso was after: The designer was thinking of Selena Gomez (whose song Good For You played on the runway) and Sofa Vergara. This is for the hip, international woman, said Basso. That translated to sultry, playful ensembles that sizzled in marigold, black, and a vivid abstract tropical print, which looked particularly fresh on a peplum top and shorts combination, not unlike something Gomez would wear on the red carpet. In fact, the print was strong enough that it didnt need the embellishments that Basso adorned it with elsewhere.\n",
      "Lace-up necklines and crop tops that wrapped at the waist injected a dose of sex appeal to the designers signature glam dresses and evening separates, as did his take on Spanish lace on body-hugging dresses. I think no matter who she is, every woman wants to have that sex appeal, said the designer. \n",
      "Basso was mindful not to stray too far from his core customer. Evening coats, boleros, and black-tie-appropriate gowns were all present. A gorgeous caramel croc bolero, styled with a saucy lace camisole and high-waisted briefs, was a standout. It was the kind of investment piece one could imagine Bassos longtime customer purchasingonly to have it promptly co-opted by her daughter.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Derek Lam 10 Crosby,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"If Derek Lam 10 Crosby VP of design Liz Giardina is endorsing fringe, pom-poms, and eyelet this spring, maybe minimalism really is on its way out. The contemporary label tends to be a bit more eclectic than the tony Derek Lam main line, but the surplus of texture and trim in this new collection still felt like a bit of a departure. Giardina started with Andalusiabull-fighting clothes, Moorish architecture, saturated colorand made it palatable for her city-dwelling customer. The Spanish reference was literal in the case of an embellished matador jacket, less so in the clingy ribbed knits with ruffled edges, but all of it was right-now wearable and in keeping with fashions artsy, far-flung mood.\n",
      "Clever twists on classic pieces are the center of the 10 Crosby brand. See: the ankle-length LBD with tiered ruffles, the crisp shirtdress with hidden suspenders, or the patchworked floral slip with dense eyelet trim. A simple knit  dress in vibrant stripes and a ropey texture also managed to be special, yet wearable. Thats the sort of piece that will draw women to the rackeven those who wouldnt normally reach for a leather lace-up jumpsuit, only to slip it on and instantly realize its endless styling potential. Of course, shoppers who are still hesitant to embrace the picador look should take note of the new accessories: raffia wedges, a patchwork hobo, or a fringed bucket bag would add just a hint of flair to any outfit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Derek Lam,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"What Happened, Miss Simone?, the Netflix doc about Nina Simones rich but up-and-down life was a starting point for Derek Lam this season. Simone is a classic Lam muse: American, independent, but not afraid to show her feminine side, and fond of both caftans and the occasional pantsuit. \n",
      "Spring found Lam working the artier, more bohemian side of his typical sportswear story. One or two of his treasured trenches made their way down the runway, lapel-free, buttonless, and as unfussy as usual. And he did a new take on sailor pants, another signature. Elsewhere, though, Lam tried out just-this-side-of-eccentric ideas like cutouts at the hips of a skirt strung together with sneaker laces, or circular swags of fringe placed here and there on a sleeveless sheath. Those looked familiar from other recent runways, and they distracted from simpler, stronger pieces like intarsia knit dresses, slips inset with lace that drifted softly away from the body, and a chic sweater whose big quirk was its bell sleeves. The show ended on a high note, with siren-y gowns that Lam suspended from the neck halter-style to expose a sexy bit of shoulder.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Devon Halfnight LeFlufy,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Devon Halfnight LeFlufy cited nostalgia as the driving force behind his Spring collection, a nod to the youth subcultures and style tribes of his adopted home, Belgium (hes Canadian by birth). Showing mostly mens, his strength, with a sprinkling of womens, the designer spoke of rave symbolism, coded dance, the frisson of youth, meta-awareness, found footage, and the regrettable unoriginality of the Internet era. A documentary-style approach, as in a rave-scene print on intentionally oversized overcoats, felt bold and novel. Also suiting the theme of idealism were LeFlufys fabrics of choice: poplin, faux leather, and a viscose rayon he developed.\n",
      "LeFlufy earned his B.A. and M.A. at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, a premier fashion college associated with the Antwerp Six. Excellent provenance, to be sure, and hes clearly benefitting from its legacy of wild imaginations, chiefly that of Walter Van Beirendonck, a pioneer of menswear with whom he trained. LeFlufys ideas are at once conceptual and energetic, not an easy feat to pull off; nor was getting on the short list for this years LVMH Prize. Itll be interesting to see where, with some tightening, he takes the label.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Diane von Furstenberg,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"In the wake of the 40th anniversary of her iconic wrap dress, Diane von Furstenberg seems keen to keep riffing on her origin story. She called her show Fortvna, after the Roman goddess of luck and the subject of the first painting Von Furstenberg ever bought. She redefines beauty and paints her own destiny, the program notes read. Fortvnas curriculum vitae sounds a bit like DVFs own. The models, for their part, wore their hair in waves with a fresh bloom tucked behind one ear, the way Von Furstenberg did in her younger days.\n",
      "Self-promotion is smart businessthe entrepreneurial Von Furstenberg would be the first to tell you that. And more often than not this walk down memory lane paid off. Perhaps nobody wouldve missed the metallic lam suede if it had stayed in the archives, and the butterfly embroidery that she lifted from the painting erred a touch on the sweet side by the time the third dress emerged in that motif. But the charm of the patchworked floral-print dresses in short and long varieties compensated. Lily Aldridges plunge-front halter number would stop New York City traffic. A shirtwaist style and a long dress crisscrossed below the bust by a skinny belt were more demure, but still fetching. \n",
      "There were a few brief nods to the 2010s in the form of olive green leather separates and a single pair of work pants, but Von Furstenbergs heart was in her heritage this season. Nearly four decades after Studio 54, the one-shoulder dress hasnt aged a day. It practically radiated here in multiple layers of saffron and pink chiffon.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Diesel Black Gold,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"According to Andreas Melbostad, the starting point for this seasons Diesel Black Gold collection was the image of a girl wearing her boyfriends button-down shirt as a dress. Thats one of those images that recur frequently in fashion, and whether the trope comes off shopworn or as a durable idea that can continually be renewed depends entirely on the inventiveness of its reinterpretation. Melbostads tack was to take scarf-like squares of cotton shirting-like fabric and pattern them intoslipdressesand skirts with handkerchief hems. The look was repeated in white-and-black geometric broderie anglaise, and with studs, and in leather, and, most appealingly, in blue-striped cotton broadcloth that quoted directly from the original inspiration. The pieces each had a kicky charm, but Melbostad hammered the look home a few too many times, which dulled the collections impact.\n",
      "Of course, Melbostad hadnt forsworn the Diesel Black Gold staples:biker jackets and denim. The brands biker signature was worked into buckle details and sharp-looking dungarees and leather overall dresses. There were also relatively straight-up biker jackets emblazoned with hardware. The jeans, meanwhile, came off best here in versions dark, mannish, and low-slung, but the Diesel Black Gold girl will also like the pairs done in lace or lace-textured white denim. Theyll look pretty sexy matched with her boyfriends button-down shirt.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dion Lee,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"When hes applying himself to the craft of his clothes, Dion Lee is the most rigorous of designers. Hes a brilliant technician. But the curious thing about Lee, as his show this morning underscored, is that he often seems incapable of applying the same degree of rigor to his collections overall as he does to their component parts. This is hardly a problem unique to Lee, but its particularly striking in his case, because both his sense of discipline and the scope of his talents are plain to see.\n",
      "Lees latest collection was a strong one, but it needed an edit. The best individual looks in the showthe black-and-navy scuba dresses with perforated flounceswere the ones that interfered most with the story Lee was trying to tell this season. And that was an interesting story: The collections nubby suedes, bias-cut linen gauze, and hues of rust and sand all expressed Lees ambition to introduce an earthy tone to his clothes, while the loose-limbed silhouettes throughout the collection and an emphasis on patterns with relaxed wraps or folds asserted a soft sensuality. Touch was key here, and was manifested on both conceptual and literal levels in Lees looped and fringed looks in black-and-white triple-ply jersey. The weave, he explained after the show, was inspired by the structure of skin. And the textile that resultedLees main technical innovation herehad a compelling muscularity. You could intuit the hand that had worked those jersey loops.\n",
      "All of which is to say, when Lee was on today, he was very on. And he was more on than off. Alongside the scuba dresses, however, there were a clutch of filler looks that should have stayed with the sales team in the showroomto wit, the suede biker jacket and slashed miniskirt, or the anodyne dress of cobweb lace. Dion Lee is Mr. Focus when it comes to the micro: If he ever figures out how to direct that focus to the macro, there will be no stopping him.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,DKNY,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"When Donna Karan debuted DKNY in 1989, she specifically declined to categorize the looks she produced as fashion. Fashion has seasons. It changes over time. What DKNY was about, Karan told reporters, was clothes. In other words, durable staple pieces that suited the on-the-go lifestyle of the brands target clientele. DKNY launched casual and took on a more formal tone as time went on; the brands most iconic look, perhaps, is the early-90s-era pinstriped power suit. That was the primary point of reference for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne, the popular pair behind the brand Public School, as they took the DKNY reins. To focus on the pinstriped suit was a canny choice on their part. Where they faltered, though, was on emphasizing fashion over clothes.\n",
      "Times have changed since DKNY first came on the scene. Chow and Osborne are perfectly aware of that, and their riff on the power suit included exactly zero actual power suits. Rather, what they offered to the present-day DKNY woman was a handful of broad-shouldered, wide-lapel pinstripe blazers, and a dazzling variety of de- and reconstructed power suit looksto wit, a sarong-style pinstriped skirt, a pinstriped tunic dress with an attached cotton skirt with shirttail hems, and broken pinstripe silk prints. There were sheer windowpane-striped fabrics, worn layered, and vertically ribbed knits that extended the pinstripe theme, as well as shirtdresses and papery white tailored pieces that toyed with other key elements of the power suit look. Some of these adaptations came off better than othersmenswear experts that they are, Chow and Osborne cut a very mean blazer, and their layered tank dresses with shirttail hems and sheer T-shirt dresses with knit underpinnings successfully updated the relaxed attitude of the original DKNY for a modern audience.\n",
      "The curious thing about this collection was that it simultaneously betrayed Chow and Osbornes deep respect for the aesthetic codes of the house theyve taken over, and their reluctance to embrace what those codes once meant. One of the ways times have changed since 1989 is that DKNY is a giant brand now, and so, to some degree, commercial imperatives may be at work. Staple pieces dont have much novelty factor on the sales floor. But it would have been nice to feel that Chow and Osborne had thought a little harder about the lifestyle, today, of the DKNY woman, and what kinds of essentials she might need.\n",
      "To their credit, Chow and Osborne approached this show with a healthy dose of humility. As they explained backstage, the missing piece motif, witnessed in the broken pinstripe prints and the pleated half-skirts, among other looks, was meant to express their sense that theyre still learning about the DKNY woman. Shes coming together, they said. But shes not all there yet.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dolce & Gabbana,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Stefano Gabbana was sitting amid a sea of accessoriesvelvet slippers with turned-up toes, earrings in the shape of lemons and oranges, crocheted raffia bags, wooden clogs with rose-painted enameled soles, and gigantic sunglasses decorated with flowers and crystalsin the Dolce & Gabbana studio before their show. Meanwhile Domenico Dolce was coaxing laughs from a model as he fitted her into a black lace bra and skirt and proceeded to demonstrate how he wanted her to first sashay the runway, then stop to take a selfie. You see? exclaimed Gabbana. We dont believe in fashion for trends any more. We want to show emotion. Just enjoy! \n",
      "Their inspiration boards were pasted with printouts of vintage posters advertising the attractions of Capri, Venice, Rome, and Florence; movie stills of Italian stars; and pictures of all kinds of handmade, homemade souvenir embroideries. This summer, the designers have moved on from exploring Sicilian history to seeing Italys glories through the eyes of the foreign tourists who began to flood into the country after World War II. There, visitors found little shops selling embroidered circle skirts and sundresses, printed scarves, sandals, straw hatsthings that Italian women had been making at home to cheer themselves up in times of austerity. This is where the first boutiques came from, explained Gabbana. We think it was the beginning of Italian fashion. And it was because foreigners saw it and liked it! Sometimes we Italians dont appreciate all the things we have here!\n",
      "Stepping back a bit to view the D&G show through the prism of the season, it seems that Italian style and culturethe flamboyant, sensual, colorful sides of itare being appreciated again. Alessandro Michele is on the same sort of track at Gucci, and at Valentino, theres a deep exploration of the glories of Rome. In fact, Dolce & Gabbana were actually on the scene first, and have succeeded in grabbing girls and women from all around their world with their seasonal travelogues. If that means ditching the anxieties of fashion and just going for clothes that suit and make you happy? So be it, say Dolce & Gabbana.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dondup,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Dondup creative director Manuela Mariotti was looking at a more feminine, romantic direction for Spring; she tapped, with gusto, into the current feeling for all things bohemian in a collection that referenced poetry, rock n roll, Shakespeare, and Glastonbury. Part indie music goddess, part Ophelia fragile beauty, the Dondup girl was ready for her close-up swathed in fluid, billowy dresses with frills galore and a touch of folklore.\n",
      "Prints were digitally reworked from Indian motifs or suzani tapestries, giving a vibrant feel to elongated lines in bright hues that popped up from a black background. The mandatory 70s-style references were also on display: high-waisted tunics, bell sleeves, wispy fabrics, troubadour-ruffled blouses, flared cropped pants. It all made for a cohesive lineup with a graceful yet concise feel, where denim was not at the core but more of an accent, presented sparingly and in relaxed shapes. It often happens when you design a collection that you get carried away, working on an idea that then brings you in a completely different direction, said Mariotti of a process that started with a futuristic vision and then morphed into a celebration of a free feminine spirit. Empowering women and enabling them to express creativity is a theme very dear to the designer, who, despite the Ladies of the Canyon hippie vibe abundantly displayed in the collection, still loves a good, tough rock n roll gig and a well-fitted, sexy pair of denim to dance the night away.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dries Van Noten,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"There comes a point in the season when the brain starts joining up the dots between collections or, in the case before us here, the trail of tarnished sequins. Something in the detail of what Dries Van Noten did todayarranging gold, copper, carnation, and pale blue paillettes in stylized, winglike patternsalso resonated across the Atlantic, with similar flashes of decoration by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte. A sense of the faded glamour of old-time movie stars (or perhaps just the fusty remains of Old Hollywood costume departments) is seeping into the edges of several shows.\n",
      "At Dries Van Noten it looked great, glimmering on the bodices of long, printed 1930s midi dresses, or decorating white shirts and placed on the shoulders of sweaters. A latter-day Katharine Hepburn would do them justice. Whether there are or arent some parallels between 30s and 40s escapism from World War II and our need to gaze in the opposite direction from todays conflicts, Van Noten didnt overtly draw attention to them in his notes. Still, there was the background of the show to contend with: not the gilded grandeur of the Htel de Ville this time, but a derelict industrial warehouse with rusting girders, accessed through a crumbling concrete loading bay choked with weeds.\n",
      "Not that there was anything melancholy or down-at-the-heels about the collection itself. Essentially it was a steady continuation of Van Notens love of rich traditional fabrics like jacquards, brocade, and shot silk, used this season in intriguing clashes of purple, yellow ocher, kingfisher blue, and watermelon. The addition of tattoo-like patterns on gloves, socks, and turtlenecks seemed to refer the eye to the Asian and tribal threads that run through the histories of such materials. There will be plenty more of the Van Notens customers favorite pantsuits, coats, blouses, and skirts next seasonif not very much to wear on a sunny summer weekend or holiday.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Dsquared2,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Dean and Dan Catens new collection for women picked up where their Spring 16 show for men left off: at the beach. Waves splashed on the backdrop of the otherwise stark set and out strutted Mariacarla Boscono in a cutout maillot and hip-slung boy pants, a tangle of colorful climbing ropes harnessing her torso. This hasnt been a big week for bathing suits, but the Catens gave us several different varieties, from sporty one-pieces to slinky little bikinis strung up with crystals. Sexy has more or less gone out of fashion in Milan, but not chez Dsquared2. Aside from those boyish trousers and a couple of pairs of high-waisted, tie-dyed jeans, the look here was seriously leggy. Pleated chiffon maxi skirts split open in the front, and otherwise it was all minis. Leather bandage dresses. Knit tube dresses worn two at a time. And, best of all, clingy scuba dresses with antecedents in Nicolas Ghesquireera Balenciaga that combined tropical prints with bold swipes of color and three-dimensional embroideries.\n",
      "This collection showcased the Catenss strengths: sexy, athletic silhouettes; special denim; their insatiable eye for color. It also exposed a weakness: their too-strappy, overly high platform shoes. Were not asking for Birkenstocks, even though real-life surfers do have a predilection for those old-school, cork-soled sandals, just something slightly more down-to-earth in which the models could really move.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Duro Olowu,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Duro Olowu has a talent for picking muses. His latest is the artist Amrita Sher-Gil, the Frida Kahlo of India, as Olowu described her, who managed to establish both an impressive body of work and an equally impressive reputation as a freethinking sexual experimenter before she died suddenly at the age of 28. Olowus silhouettes this season were a touch suggestive of those of India in the last days of the Rajthose late 30s bias cuts, broad lapels, and built-up shoulders fit neatly into his idiombut, mainly, it was Sher-Gils spirit that he drew on for his new collection. He conjured her via a mix of boldness and ultra-femininity.\n",
      "The boldness came through in the prints, the best of which was a dot-and-stripe on silk that Olowu confessed hed doodled while on the telephone. (Never throw anything away, is the moral of that story.) There was also a painterly yet graphic wild orchid print, which Olowu executed with his typically canny sense of color.\n",
      "Olowus clothes always have a feminine flaireven his tailored pieces boast a certain voluptuousness. He doubled down on that here, showing lots of looks that featured flounces and ruffles. A long ruffle-hemmed camisole, worn with a matching likewise ruffled long skirt for a tiered effect, made for one of the collections standout looks. Another was a black dress open in the back and ruffled down each side; Olowu doesnt usually mess around with neutrals, but this frocks all-black color (or lack thereof) only showcased the grace of its cut. There was a similarly appealing sense of frankness to the cotton pieces in cobalt and khaki.\n",
      "As noted, Sher-Gil died young. Perhaps that accounts for the fact this collection seemed an unusually youthful one for Olowu. It was hard to put a finger on where that tone came from exactlythese clothes werent a far cry from those Olowu has created in the past. Maybe it was the extra skin on display, about the back and shoulders; maybe it was the way these pieces, even down to the gowns, exuded an air of thrown-on informality. Whatever it was, the youthful kick added to the appeal of Olowus familiar aesthetic, without diminishing its friendliness to women of all ages, styles, and shapes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Each x Other,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"Perhaps the easiest way to explain Each x Other is to think of it as Fashion x Statement. Designers Jenny Mannerheim and Ilan Delouis once again turned out attitude-enhancing clothes conducive to art parties (no coincidence the show took place at Emmanuel Perrotins spare gallery in the Marais). Then they recruited ongoing collaborator, poet-artist Robert Montgomery, as well as editor Jefferson Hack, to anchor the collection in idiosyncratic aphorisms. You sleep on the feathers of birds and their flights fill your dreams, from the former; Hack the system (in which the letters HA appear dripped over an FU) from the latter. Using words to build a wardrobe, explained Mannerheim, reinforces the semiotics of style  and self-expression. Basically, we can choose to communicate overtly by sporting an oxford shirt patched and embroidered with Montgomerys words, or a T-shirt printed and embroidered with Hacks. Or else we leave ourselves open to interpretation when we wear a mannish peony pink suit, or a tailored jacket featuring unraveled, pleated cuffs.\n",
      "Like the contrast in tone established by their guest contributors (who, incidentally, have known each other for 15 years), the collection boiled down to counterintuitive pairings: striped silk pajama pants with a black leather bra; a languid ivory robe coat disciplined with black straps down the sleeves, and extra-long feather-printed shirttails trailing from snug cavalry jackets. There was also a Belgian influence  la Dries, Ann, and Veroniqueunspoken yet unmistakablewhich they used to dial up the poetic rawness. Mannerheim mentioned how artists, be it the Beats or Impressionists, have proven stronger as collectives than as individuals. And indeed, one cant help but wonder whether this duo is too reliant on its Other. But then, as one of Hacks other musings seemed to suggest, the essence of cultural is the cult.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Eckhaus Latta,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"In recent seasons, Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta have risen to industry-wide prominence with their label, often described as arty, avant garde, or post-gender. The RISD grads have a real point of view (a rarer thing than you might think), which is unlike anything else on the New York schedule. For Spring they came up with an evocative collection, working, as usual, without set concepts (no Paris in the 70s or the work of Jackson Pollock for these two).\n",
      "When the bicoastal designers convened in their New York studio to prepare for todays show, they were struck by a feeling that fairly pulsed through their samples: lust. Whether the stuff of the id or just ideas that are bubbling around in Pops collective unconsciousness (some would say between the runway and the red carpet, were more preoccupied with baring it all than ever before), these clothes were hot-blooded and also eerily poignant.\n",
      "For some, the nudity (transparent pieces galore) on Eckhaus Lattas catwalk will be the foremost topic of conversation, but as Eckhaus and Latta approached the idea, it had to be among fashions least gaze-oriented expressions of the body. These might be clothes about titillation, but they didnt seem intended to titillate. Chalk some of that up to the casting choices: Alongside proper models were extended EL family of various ages and walks of life (Dev Hynes, Juliana Huxtable, Alexandra Marzella, and Grace Dunham, among others). Even the bits that didnt bare it all revealed plenty. Consider pants slashed along the knees or the back of calves, or a slip dress hem that fell above the knee to reveal a flash of thigh. Even when Rihanna shows up in a sheer body stocking, theres the sense that she has revealed less than these clothes did. The collection was largely stripped bare, with gorgeous, anemone-like body pieces crafted from glass bugle beads functioning as one of a couple of nods to self-ornamentation in the traditional sense.\n",
      "Beyond the conceptual, there were plenty of just plain great clothes here, and wearable to boot. The most transparent styles would work well for layering; meanwhile, a cropped suede mock turtleneck and the sensuous peach velvet suit were things that many a front row guest was keen to wear straight off the runway. The cerebral and the visceral in one collection? Now, thats versatility.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Edeline Lee,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"Edeline Lee drew upon a pleasing confluence of inspirations this season. The London-based designer was having a Richard Diebenkorn moment, appreciating the painters Ocean Park series, when it struck her that the artists palette, and his geometries, dovetailed with those of the designers of the Memphis Group. The graphic Memphis look is trending in fashion these days, and Lee wound up leaning toward that aesthetic as she whipped up pieces for her new collection; the influence was particularly clear in items such as the shift and maxi-length shirtdress featuring a multicolored geometric placement of prints.\n",
      "These looks had plenty of pop, but Lee was onto something fresher in the garments that conjured Diebenkorns more poetic tone and softer line. Specifically, the designer had winners in her twisted tops and dresses in a painterly jacquard, and the plainspoken white or pastel-colored halter tops and culottes, which suggested Diebenkorns brand of California cool without hammering the reference home. Elsewhere, a pencil dress that collaged several pastel-patterned fabrics married the softness of Diebenkorns canvases with the architectural sensibility of the Memphis school.\n",
      "Lee sometimes has a habit of overworking her designs, but she mostly kept a lid on that here. She flubbed a few pieces by introducing unnecessary sculptural flourishes or insisting on an out-of-whack proportion, but where she kept her looks simple, and let their fine materials, gorgeous palette, and cheerful geometries do the talking, the clothes didnt just speak, they began to sing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Edun,Chioma Nnadi,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Tethering high-fashion values to sustainable ones isnt an easy task, yet its something that creative director Danielle Sherman has managed to do since she took the helm of Edun in 2013. The brands commitment to producing ethically sound clothing in Africa is now a decade deep, thanks to founders Ali Hewson and Bono, and for Sherman the continent has been a rich source of inspiration too. \n",
      "This season it was the ceremonial dance costumes of the Kuba Kingdom in Central Africa that piqued the designers interest, and those familiar with the tribes distinctive graphic textiles might have picked up on the influence in the hand-loomed polka-dot pattern on a fringed jumpsuit. Beyond that, though, the references were anything but literal. Intricate African craftwork was subtly woven throughout insteadbe it on the tassel of a pointy slipper that was made in Morocco, or the macram trimming of a modish cropped suit fabricated in Madagascar. \n",
      "There was a gentle 30s sway to the collection tooa nod to Dada performance artist Sophie Taeuber-Arpand you could see signs of it in the contrast stitching of pleated pinafore dresses  and the neckline of a charming sailor-inspired look. One standout top in workmans orange was a particularly compelling take on the off-the-shoulder trend thats been sweeping both the runway and the streets this season. Given that the brands sleek new line of handbags was manufactured in South Africa, its clear that Sherman is charting new territory with Edun in more ways than one.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Electric Feathers,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" October 21, 2015\",\"People only vaguely familiar with the label Electric Feathers may be tempted, viewing its collections, to see very little change over the years. Members of the growing Electric Feathers club can see the evolution, however. Designer Leana Zuniga is committed to certain looksblouson trousers, architectural sundresses, rope-necked jumpsuitsbut shes updated her silhouettes of late, and elevated her fabrications. The most obvious change this season was Zunigas deployment of print, which she generally eschews. Her fine stripe and tonal ikat introduced a distinct, albeit understated sense of rhythm to the pieces where they were found, while a more graphic print of joined hands added some jolt to the new collection without detracting from its overall, minimalist hippie vibe.\n",
      "Electric Feathers aficionados will also note that Zuniga jettisoned her signature harem pant silhouette in favor an exaggerated jodhpur; girls with a religious affinity for harem hems can continue to find them in the one-shoulder, knee-length romper, another new shape. Zunigas best innovation on that front, however, was her broad-legged trouser and jumpsuit, with an overlayer of fabric that made the items read more like a voluminous skirt or dress. Pieces like that explain the Electric Feathers cult: These are clothes impossible to categorize as casual or dressy. You can wear them either way, and theyre both at once. The tailored garments that punctuated the collection erred more toward the casual side; items in peach-toned silk lam veered dressy. But Zunigas allergy to fussiness always prevails, and to such a degree that its possible to overlook the rigor of her method. But make no mistake: As this season reaffirmed, Leana Zuniga brings a steel-spined discipline to bear on her project, which is to reinvent the look and feel of the basic.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Elie Saab,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Elie Saab is an eveningwear specialist with an established formula for often monochromatic, unapologetically romantic gowns studded with embellishment thats as intricate as his ambition is straightforward: Saab wants to make his customers happy. Many of these customersliterally, hundreds of themwere at his show today, as usual accounting for one enormous big-haired and super-spritzed bank of seating at his Tuileries venue. What they saw, though, seemed subtly different from the designers tried-and-tested narrative.\n",
      "Its not different, demurred the man himself backstage afterward. Its the same. But the mix is different. \n",
      "In short, this meant the insertion of more separates and versatile day-to-night pieces before the introduction of Saabs nocturnal standards. For proof, inspect the first looks on two of his big-name castings. Both Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner wore mid-length dresses; Hadids was tiered in blue lace, Jenners black and with an empire line. Over these, they wore bomber jacketsHadids in rich candy-striped gazar, Jenners in a more softly toned floral embroidery. Although he is not entirely new to the bomber, to put both of these bound-to-be-Instad models in the jacket sent a message; this was Saab-meets-street. To underline that, there was a distinctly un-Saab black-flashed white tracksuit worn with flat sandals and Jenners floral bomberwhich acted as a radical foil to the more conventional pussy-bowed white jacket and wide pants in broderie anglaise that had preceded it. Leather mini suits with small floral cutouts; a soft silk armless striped jacket; a cute black lace bomber; and a crystal-spattered, floral-patched, halter-neck white minidress  (almost tennis-like in its silhouette) were a few other examples of the new elements in Saabs mix. It made for a pleasantly broadened watching experience. But he was careful to emphasize, however, that he wasnt about to throw the baby out with the bathwater: He makes a mean macram lace gownsimultaneously wistful and willful of aspectand there were plenty here. The closer to the finale, the denser the eveningwear became, alive with fin, sparkle, ripple, and train. By the time his stars reappearedJenner in a deep-V crystal and lace jumpsuit with two trails of sheer black silk that ran from shoulder to ankle and whipped in the air as she walked, and Hadid in a complicatedly luxe-goth black open-front dress of lace and silk panelsnormal service had resumed. Ive just met many of my clients now and everybody is happy, reported Saab. And if theyre happy, hes happy.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Elie Tahari,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"The playful, artisanal vibes that trended heavily on the Fall runways are still a big message for Spring 16, particularly for contemporary brands like Elie Tahari. The designer was thinking about the intersection of natural and future this season, so he moved away from the architectural silhouettes hes known for and embraced an easier, more bohemian sensibility. Billowing chiffon dresses, deconstructed tweed jackets, and loose-fitting trousers in soft shades of taupe, cream, and black felt destined for a trip to the sun-baked desert.\n",
      "New for Tahari was the mix of textures, like a jeweled tank with a raw linen skirt or a suede safari jacket over a ramie dress. Pat Cleveland took the stage in a twill coat spliced with swaths of lace appliqu; paired with ankle-length pants and gladiator sandals, it was arguably the best outfit. Cleveland always looks sensational, but she embodied Taharis ideal woman in that all-white ensemble: It was sharp, sophisticated, and feminine, but with a new sense of warmth.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ellery,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Kym Ellerys inspiration this season was the 1969 work Wrapped Coast by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, which found the famed land artistes covering one and a half miles of rocky Sydney coastline in tarp. The reference was legible, on a literal level, in the clothes that Ellery showed this morning, but it almost worked better as a metaphor for her development as a designer in the past year: Ellery has always exuded a vast ambition, but she seems now to have made peace with the idea that the only way to execute her ambitions is to discipline them, strap them down.\n",
      "The designers evolved sense of rigor was nowhere better demonstrated here than in her approach to volume. She still likes her clothes to take up lots of space, but she found lots of ways in this collection to control her volumes, or concentrate them into small, significant gestures. An example of the latter were Ellerys artfully suspended bell-shaped sleeves; one particularly good instance of the former was the navy silk sundress that shed gathered, here and there, to create rows of soft pleats. Ellerys volumes felt targeted and specific, in other words.\n",
      "With volume playing a supporting role, much of the drama of this collection came from its fabrications. Ellery is a textile obsessive, and she deployed some outstanding ones this seasonvelvets printed in a sea-pod pattern; a feathery cream-colored knit fused to create weight; cloudy jacquard; crepes, silks, and shirting cottons with an ultra-luxe hand. You didnt have to get close to the clothes to appreciate the excellence of the materials; it was self-evident from the way everything draped. Ellerys standout material, though, was the crinkly metallic fabric she used in her shows terrific closing looks. Ellery showed off her design maturity in those looks by not gilding the lilythe fabric was gilded enough, all it required was a simple, pencil-snug shape.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Emanuel Ungaro,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Great designers greatness is stamped on our memory by the signature codes they leave behind them. Hence, when other designers succeed the houses founder, they face a challenge: a delicate wrestle between the codes they have signed up to inherit and the urge to express their own point of view. Their own codes, in fact. Today Fausto Puglisi cleverly sucked the tension out of that dialectic by focusing on Emanuel Ungaros joyfully frothy output of the late 60s and early 70s. It was a neat little maneuver; by sidestepping Ungaro-in-his-80s-pomp for Ungaro juvenilia, Puglisi had something new to play with.\n",
      "As the mood board demonstrated, Ungaro in the 60s was a man of his timeand a designer whose years working at Balenciaga and most powerfully at Courrges could be seen in his work. Puglisi chose to focus on a set of sweetly provocative floral macram looks, all froth and of-that-era liberation touched with a softened Space Age futurism.\n",
      "Impressively, Puglisi re-established a connection with the Swiss factory that made Ungaros 60s pieces to create a wonderfully psychedelic lace macram of ochre flowers and paisley petals used in his last capeletteamed with matching thigh-highsand a long loose skirt. The netted-check that ran throughout the collection, even down to the weave of the pressed-foam ruffles that edged many of these looks, appeared to be lifted from a pair of pants one of the mood board images showed Ungaro fitting on Twiggy. A harder, more Puglisi-ish preoccupationFaustian?expressed itself in the ringlet bonding on black vinyl and hot pink skirts, and as suspension on floral-scattered bustiers. A little bit bondage, maybe, but also . . . romantic? Puglisi ventured backstage; we had a laugh at that. This is not a collection for wallflowers or delicate petalsbut for a woman in search of punchy, in-your-face prettiness, it will have allure.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Emilia Wickstead,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Emilia Wickstead, a designer known for dressing some of the most high-profile women in London society, rolled out a bubblegum pink carpet for her models today. That saccharine color was perhaps a nod to the 50s optimism that inspired the collection, which was awash with soft hues recalling the era, such as pistachio, mustard, and apricot. It was the floral prints, though, which could have been swiped from a 50s dining room, that made the biggest impression. The cropped high-waisted pants and blouse that were sprigged with contrasting flower arrangements, for instance, were a modern way to wear the traditional, ladylike motif.\n",
      "Of course dresses are still Wicksteads mainstay, and there were plenty to choose from. The designer isnt one to shy away from volume; one billowing geometric print look fell somewhere between a cape and a dress, and another came with an impressive Watteau train. Her experiments with proportion were at their most successful when confined to the sleeve of a frock; somehow the gathered bishop sleeves felt more medieval than mid-century modern, a vaguely Game of Thrones-ian feeling that has been coming through this season. (Incidentally, Michele Clapton, the shows costume designer, is up for an Emmy Award this weekend.) That subtle yet dramatic approach to evening will no doubt find favor with Wicksteads circle of well-dressed and well-connected fans.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Emilio de la Morena,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 23, 2015\",\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, it has been said. Emilio de la Morena took that principle to heart this season. And thank goodness: De la Morenas dressmaking talents shine brightest when he pares his looks down to their essences, yet he frequently evinces an aversion to doing that, as though afraid his designs wont seem distinctive unless he overcomplicates them. Not so here. This was a collection with a straightforward mandatepretty dressesand its flourishes were relatively few. Which made for some knockout frocks to wear to a cocktail do. \n",
      "The designer presented a fabric-focused lineup. De la Morena has great taste when it comes to textiles, and the materials he used served to elevate his most matter-of-fact looks. The cream-color jacquard, for instance, introduced an earthy note to a soign pencil dress, courtesy of the pebbled texture. Tonal striped black gazar was not only sexy, given its semi-transparency, but it also allowed de la Morena to play with his signature geometric effects without detracting from the collections understated mood. Elsewhere, plain pink or yellow silk had a perfect, limpid drapeone of those qualities in clothes that looks no-brainer but is actually devilishly hard to achieve.\n",
      "The most striking pieces, meanwhile, were the pastel frocks and dressy separates embroidered with patches in metallic brocade. The patches were in the shape of mountain flowers, de la Morena said; the pattern they made was redolent of leopard print, which wasnt a bad thing. There was also a very cool green-toned organza brocade with metallic fabric filaments left exposed. The effect was a touch uncanny, in a good way, and here in particular de la Morenas strategy of hewing to classic A-line silhouettes allowed the specialness of his material to speak for itself.\n",
      "This collection wasnt simple in the sense that it was minimal or basic. It was simple in that it wasnt cluttered by a bunch of superfluous ideas. There were just a couple of superfluities; but then, simplicity is a discipline. Its a muscle. This season, de la Morena began again to work it out.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Emilio Pucci,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Emilio Pucci opened his first store in Capri, in 1949, serving up kaleidoscopic printed dresses that by the 60s had become signifiers of a jet-set lifestyle recognizable well beyond Italian vacation destinations. Massimo Giorgetti, the young founder of MSGM, one of Milan's recent success stories, took the wheel at the iconic house earlier this year after Peter Dundass departure. For his debut today, Giorgetti started at the seaside, which was the right instinct: As the birthplace of Pucci, it was a natural place for a new beginning. \n",
      "Giorgetti uncovered some compelling pieces from the archives; a glance at his backstage mood board suggested he has an eye for the more obscure elements in the Pucci oeuvre. Unfortunately, this show was a bit of a muddle: too literal in its references (there were sea turtles and lobsters tangled up in a fishnet dress), too dependent on styling, and surprisingly low on prints. Though it seems a shame to ignore them, especially for a designer who built his business on irreverent mashups of color, texture, and pattern, prints aren't the only route to success at Pucci. The industry has seen enough revivals to know that it takes more than reverence for a houses heritage to make things click for an incoming designer. But spelling out the founder's first name in script across the back of a slip dress, along the borders of a shift, and on the straps of flat sandals isn't the way to go either.\n",
      "Hiring Giorgetti for the job indicated that the Pucci powers-that-be were after a radical change, targeting the street style and Instagram-obsessed younger crowd that's been his sweet spot at MSGM. That in and of itself isnt a negative, and there are clearly larger opportunities at lower price points. But Giorgetti has some work to do to right this ship.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Emporio Armani,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Has a gray Armani pantsuit ever before been worn with a cropped T-shirt with a smiley emoji on it? Doubtful, but theres always a first time for everything, and that was the way Giorgio Armani chose to open his Spring Emporio show, maybe to emote a little casualness. He got rid of his runway, too, and instead had his models walk on an illuminated path, as if at street level (that is, as street level as you can get when youre showing inside the vast Tadao Ando theater youve installed inside your own lofty building).\n",
      "In a funny way, this is a favorable fashion moment for Armani againthings have generally turned relaxed and casual, and he is once more a flat-shoe man in a flat-shoe time (exactly what Armani endured during the long reign of mega-platforms may only be imagined). So now he can get back to his natural state, putting models in low, pointy ankle boots and a variety of casual-formal, sporty-pretty shorts, jackets, and tops for spring.\n",
      "Gone are the days when Armani shows were essays in a million shades of greige. (There was a time for greige, lets remember: It was the color of armor an entire generation of pioneering American power women wore to go into executive battle from the late 70s through the early 90s.) This time, he added a powdery bois de rosepink by any other namein a variety of techniques that hinted at flowers, be that brocaded floral tailoring, or a soft hybrid of blouse and jacket, laser-cut into overlapping petals.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Erdem,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Erdems first look said it all: A girl with a slightly trance-like expression on her pale face was treading her way along a red earth pathway, prettily dressed in a delicate Victoriana yoked dress of pale gray chiffon, strewn with embroidered pink and white flowers, which seemed to be coming apart at the shoulders. So far, so enchantingbut what the designer said about his inspiration will make you go back and take a long second look: It was about prairie madness, he explained backstage. In 1862, Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead Act, which gave single women and widows the right to their own plots of land in the West, as long as they stayed there for five years. So there were all these women coming from their homes in Europe, bringing their clothes and the remnants of their lives in Norway and Germany and places like thatand they started to suffer from agoraphobia and all kinds of psychological illnesses. A quick Wikipedia check also shows that suicide was not uncommon among these lonely women. Could that black velvet ribbon at her neck, knotted and displaced to the side, start to look a little different in that light?\n",
      "Erdems productions have taken on an almost cinematic quality recently, often hinting at the backstories of imaginary girls and women who have fallen on hard times or traveled far from their secure homes. Last season, he placed his show in a down-at-the-heels 50s apartment set belonging to an heiress whose hopes in life were unraveling; before that, it was a tropical greenhouse for a tale about a Victorian woman botanist. Part of this, he always says, comes from spending his boyhood obsessively watching Merchant Ivory films. Hes a romantic who can only design once he knows the character hes dressing.\n",
      "The prairie girls, with their extraordinary wardrobes of ankle-length flounced dresses made of beautifully wrought lace, crochet, and embroidery fabrics, are his sequel. They arrived by railroadpushed along on an actual train track in a former freight yard in the hinterland of Kings Cross station, with a few sticks of furniture to their names, and then proceeded to make their long, melancholy walk to a crackly soundtrack of Emily Dickinsons poetry.\n",
      "Well, put it another way: Erdem may be brilliant at research and atmospherics, but in the real world he also knows the minds of the women he actually dresses. Next summer, they are basically going to be in prettiness heaven.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Erin Fetherston,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Since her very first collection in 2005, Erin Fetherston immediately established her universe as one of whimsy and hyper-femininity. Jeans have hardly had a place in the designers fairy tale. But this season she surprised by showing a handful of laid-back denim pieces, inspired by fashions perennial muse, Jane Birkin. Fetherston should step out of her comfort zone more often: The overalls, shorts, and culottes in soft dark denim provided a welcome antidote to the designers tendency toward the overly sweet.\n",
      "Also new for the brand: a capsule collection of minaudires that recalled needlepoint hoops and were stitched with cute phrases, faces, or the word love. Branching out into accessories is almost always a smart decision for a fledgling labeleven more so when they are as Instagrammable as these. Fetherston hit the nail on the head.\n",
      "Needlepoint was a recurring theme in the collection, paying homage to the designers other muse this season: Anne of Avonlea, the early-20th-century, Prince Edward Islanddwelling heroine of the Anne of Green Gables series. Arcadian reverie, is how Fetherston described it. There was certainly a pastoral beauty to the floral-print dresses and skirts, some cut with a train or layered with delicate sheer fabric that billowed behind the models as they walked. Slips in sky blue, baby pink, and navy provided a base for some of these sheer looks and also stood on their own, topped, at times, with a matching knife-pleated capelet. White lace maxi dresses with high necks hinted at the Edwardian lace and collars worn by Anne in her dayand reclaimed decades later by Birkin. Like all of Fetherstons collections, Spring was romanticyet it was a grown-up romance.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ermanno Scervino,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Its a passion play of opposites, said an upbeat Ermanno Scervino backstage before rushing out to greet Italys First Lady, Agnese Landini, a friend and loyal client. The collection he presented today celebrated his signature hyper-feminine, Italian-diva style, though he tempered it with a contrasting dose of masculine and sporty elements. Fortunately for Scervinos fans, this did not tarnish the glam factor; on the contrary, it polished the edges, giving the lineup a contemporary feel.\n",
      "Craftsmanship took center stage with an elaborate display of materials, textures, and finishes. Lace was utilized in myriad waysbonded with a double layer of delicate guipure, embroidered with macram and jacquard feuillage, and fused with cashmere pashmina to sumptuous effect. The silhouettes were either elongated and slim or sensual and shapely; evening fabrics were worked into tailored day coats and pantsuits. Light organza gave shape to a classic tuxedo duster worn with cropped pants and flat embroidered babouches. In another clever conception, a sporty olive green jumpsuit was paired with a luxe mink jacket dyed a bright shade of bubblegum pink. Masculine shirts in crisp striped poplin were a chic counterpoint to tight duchesse satin pencil midi skirts, while shades of lipstick red served as an unexpected and striking contrast to a delicate periwinkle hue. The result was a lineup of edge and modernity, spicing up Scervinos trademark sensual touch.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Escada,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Though Escada wont officially turn 40 until 2018, the Munich-based brand has already started celebrating. For his Spring 2016 offering, fashion director Daniel Wingate sought to emphasize the history of the label without getting stuck in the past. The piece that perhaps best typified this effort was a silky, tailored blazer inspired by Escadas scarves from the late 60s and 70s, which was paired with smart black trousers: Its the kind of thing that serves a woman equally well at the office or at a cocktail party.\n",
      "Versatility and comfort were key this season. Looks were styled with flats to emphasize a certain effortlessness to the clothes that will appeal to Escadas busy career woman: Slouchy trousers, roomy culottes, and oversize tunics popped up in neutrals as well as primary colors like red and yellow (or limoncello as the brand calls it). The eveningwear was also carefully considered. A romantic, delicate blush pink cardigan was a thoughtful additionfor the demure or the always-coldto the matching strapless dress it was styled with.\n",
      "Escada is best when it sticks to simplicity. The floral pantsuit and chain-link belt felt overcomplicated, and the jumpsuit-gown combo, though daring, seemed a little out of place. Still, simple neednt mean boring: One of the strongest looks consisted of perforated white leather culottes styled with a white shirt that wrapped at the waist.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Esteban Cortazar,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"This time last year, Esteban Cortazar presented a collection that hed already sold to retailers during the Resort seasonorders were placed even before the press weighed in. While rethinking the industry cycle might not be half as sexy as Roos Abelss absshe being the very young model who opened tonights showit does help explain how Cortazar seems to have settled into the fashion firmament so fast. \n",
      "And now that his brand is viable, he can start having fun, which meant channeling an otherworldly creature as his latest muse. Hence the python bra top, asymmetric metallic leather gilet, and platform sandals encrusted with Swarovski crystals. Compared with Cortazars past two go-rounds, this collection felt less mannered, more spontaneous, as he put it. He credited the ideas to night-long parties in Ibiza this summer, and how the clubbing impulse dates back more than half his life, to when he was a precocious teen in Miami. Beyond flaunting youthful vibes, the pieces boasted savoir faire. Laser-cut skins were backed in metallic jersey; Lurex knit was developed to resemble a surface of jewels and then lined in cashmere so that it would feel soft, not scratchy; and metal rings were affixed onto coats like contraband watches, creating a clanging chorus with each step. It was about not being afraid to just play, said Cortazar. The past two seasons I was building her universe; this season I just wanted her to be brave.\n",
      "A clingy jersey dress slashed with shimmer has already proven a retail favorite, as has an oversize shirt that billows from behind. Tellingly, they represent two of Cortazars easier looks; yet theyre sure to get heads turning from dusk to dawn.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Etro,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Veronica Etro today delivered a sumptuous medley of house staplesthe kaleidoscopic prints, the rich concentration of color, and the bohemian sensibilityin a collection that also melded European folk costume, Victorian Pre-Raphaelite nostalgia, haberdashery, Arts and Crafts, and a shot of Ballets Russes. It was pretty busy. Yet it was to Etros great credit that with so very much going on here, at first glance nothing on the runway ever seemed especially OTT.For while there was plenty of ruche and flounce and ruffle in her silhouettes, particularly on the soft undulations of her sleeves, these were never jarringly proportioned pieces.To get lost you had to stareintothe clothes.\n",
      "On one look alone, quilted printed cotton was shot against gridded twine run through with embroidered ribbons that were overlaid with ivory silk and hemmed with silver lace above a scalloped hem. Reversible bombers combined strata of ribbon and dvor silk. A lace-fringed dress was a patchwork of floral-wrought paisleypatterns drawn from the Etro archiveoverlaid with a hypnotic constellation of dots that recalled the antipodean psychedelia of Kean Etros most recent menswear show.\n",
      "Backstage, Etro said that she had left some of the finishes rough in the wine-toned closing section to resist the sweetness and whimsy so much ornament might otherwise muster. There was friction and roughness and pain in this romance; just so, emotional perfection was not the objective. In a season that is betting heavy on 2010s appropriations of kooked-up 70s approximations (thinkPicnic at Hanging Rock) of Edwardian lady laciness, Etros analogue abandon was a cynicism-free take: Victoriana eminently incorporable into the cool-girl wardrobe.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Eudon Choi,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"Eudon Choi spirited showgoers away to Gaelic lands with a palette-cleansing collection that sprung from the fantastical paintings of John Anster Fitzgerald. The Victorian artist, known for fairy-filled works that may have been opium-fueled, brought an ethereal touch to Chois otherwise minimalist spring outing. The sprightly references came through from the delicate sprays of pale blue lace that showed up on sleeves and skirts, right down to the pleasingly off-kilter, mismatched Victoriana boots. There was another, very on-point mood at work here though: the waif-like lines of the grunge era. This was a fairy fantasy with an undeniably 90s edge. The decades strong, stripped-back feel appeared in the industrial slate fabrics that opened the show on layered dresses and capes, and later in the raw-edged drape shirts and asymmetric slash skirts hewn in tactile, Irish linen.\n",
      "As the dreamy chords of Portisheads It Could Be Sweet played out, the palette shifted from cerise to soft peach to midnight blue with Mackintosh-y dresses that Choi intends to be worn to smart gallery shows. There was a breezy, oversize silhouette throughout, as well as a minor obsession with drawstrings, which allowed Choi free play with shape and volume. Gone were the harsh and architectural lines of Fall. In their place came a lesson in restrained prettiness. For the finale, these proportions became even more exaggerated in pale hued jacquard day gowns that provided full cover. Theres so much body consciousness in the world, Choi said after the show, referring to the protective feel of the more voluminous looks. I wanted to create an elegant and easy beauty that allows an escape from that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Faith Connexion,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Brooklyn may be trending in Paris, but the vibe at Faith Connexions headquarters is distinctly L.A. sur la Seine. Step through the door at its htel particulier (part of which is a small hotel) and a certain very famous someones matte black Porsche Panamera is parked there. In the courtyard, members of fashions fabulous class are gossiping while eating lunch while texting on their iPhones. At the reception, a fashion shoot in which a blogger poses, lying shoeless underneath an antique chair, is taking place. \n",
      "Upstairs in the showroom, where the racks are lined with torn jeans, graffitied leather jackets, and lacy white dresses that look like they stepped off the set of Guns N' Roses November Rain video, the sales are brisk. Faith Connexion has never done a runway show and refuses to name its designer (it's more or less an open secret that former Balmain creative director Christophe Decarnin is in charge). The brand has caught on in spite of all that, because nobody nails the grungy, I-woke-up-like-this lifestyle better. For spring, the attitude is essentially the same as previous seasons, only more California-fied. Tropical prints registered as new, as did sweatshirts spray-painted with palm trees. Hammer pants, which take their name from Oakland, Californias native son, MC Hammer, even turned up. But the big winners here will be the oversize army jackets tagged by Faith Connexion's resident graffiti artists, whose appeal appears to be universal. A rep reports they sent 25 of said jackets to a Seoul, Korea, store and they sold out in a week. In a savvy development, the brand is now also customizing the jackets to clients' specifications\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Fashion East,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Caitlin Price is London fashions latest phenom. Much like Simone Rocha, Pricewho showed her second collection today as part of the Fashion East lineup of emerging designersmade her mark on the scene by inventing a new kind of girl, one with her own distinctive look and attitude. Only time will tell whether the Caitlin Price woman will prove to be as multidimensional as the one Rocha dreamed up. This season, Price has sharpened her outlines, showing new versions of the luxuriously fabricated, beautifully detailed tracksuits that she offered in her debut, and expanding her dialogue between high and low aesthetics by creating half-gown skirts and cutaway nightclubbing dresses that had the tough tone and casual mien of streetwear. The mix of silk and poly taffetas in the looks underscored the high-low theme. Price is up to something genuinely interesting, but she gave few hints here as to how she plans to augment her design vocabulary. In the meantime, though, she has gotten everyones attention.\n",
      "This Is The Uniform, a new entry into Fashion East, is the brainchild of recent Goldsmiths grad Jenna Young. Its her bad luck that she was showing with Price, inasmuch as the two cover similar territory. Youngs debut likewise toyed with ways to draw appreciative attention to and elevate the look of working-class youth. Her take was less audacious and clear-cut than Prices, but on the other hand, more expansive. Her mix of sharp crop tops, net sweaters, A-line minidresses, and trousers slungvery  inventivelybelow the hip hinted at a strong instinct for creating the elements of a womans wardrobe as opposed to a few strong headline pieces.\n",
      "Fellow Fashion East newcomer Richard Malone also concerns himself with the working class. His modus operandi is more conceptual, however, than that of Young or Price. For starters, theres his approach to fabrication: Malones workwear materials were sourced from overstock and other types of waste, and though he elevated these fabrics by sculpting them into rather soign shapes, he maintained a sense of matter-of-factness by eschewing corsetry or other restrictive elements. His clothes are made to function. And the emphasis on wearability went to the collections overarching theme, which was a celebration of female labor, at home and in the workplace. A high-waisted, flared jumpsuit with a ruffled halter neck didnt at first seem like a garment that could withstand the trenches, but, in fact, it was cut precisely to stand up to a hard days work. Ditto a striped dress expanding in wavelike volume as it extended toward the knee. Malones look was intriguing, but it was his sensitivity to the user experience of his clothes that makes him one to keep an eye on.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Faustine Steinmetz,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Faustine Steinmetz turned the idea of denim inside out with her first collection, and the intricate hand-loomed pieces she created from recycled thrift-store jeans were anything but basic. In her third season, the French designer is looking to grow her business beyond the confines of her atelier in East London. She partnered with a denim mill in Spain for Spring 2016, and the resulting collaboration takes her artisanal sensibilities to exciting and scalable places.\n",
      "Micro-pleated denim is among the new fabric developments in her repertoire (clearly the Issey Miyake ripple effect we saw come through in New York is making waves across the pond, too), and it gave a sculptural dimension to such staples as the jean jacket. To add to her experiments with true blues, Steinmetz took to deconstructing the tracksuit with what shes calling dvor jersey; one classic gray marl sweatshirt, in particular, unraveled into a stream of floor-grazing fringing. Her couture-like weaving expertise showed up in the hand of a striped polo shirt, which, like the pieces of her first collection, took a week to make. In an age when supply and demand often takes precedence in the fashion food chain, its encouraging to see a young designer picking up the thread of time-honored production values in a modern wardrobe with such spellbinding innovation.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Fausto Puglisi,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"Fausto Puglisi admitted to a case of nerves before his show today. Since he arrived on the Milan Fashion Week scene three years ago, embroideries have been his stock in trade: bold, brassy, and full-throttle. Possessing as strong a signature as Puglisi does is something of a mixed blessing. We all love a designer with a recognizable voice, but sooner or later that voice starts to sound familiar. Puglisis new collection for Spring represented his biggest step yet away from the embellishments with which he made his name; hence the nerves. \n",
      "Citing Madame Grs and Halston as reference points, Puglisi embraced silk jersey with a hand so supple, so liquid that it has to be touched to be appreciated. But even without copping a feel, you could tell he was up to something new and different with a draped ivory gown boasting an asymmetrical cape straight out of ancient Greek statuary. We expect to see that dress making the rounds this awards season: It was that soign. Other goddess dresses in that same material, be they short, or suspended from a bandeau bathing suit top, or in a bright combination of red, white, and blue struck a more expected note. They werent bad; they just didnt have that element of surprise. \n",
      "In the end, this collection wasnt a complete departure anyway. There were scads of Puglisis beloved embroideries, but he gave them a novel spin, mixing honest-to-goodness seashells with sprays of multicolor rhinestones, part Malibu, part Dallas, with some fine Italian-made intarsia knits thrown into the mix. Not for the timid, but then thats never been the Puglisi way. We have a hunch that the encrusted cowboy boots, if he winds up retailing them, could become a mini cult hit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Fay,Kerry Olsen,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"One can always count on a pithy comment from those Milan stalwarts Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi. Chaotic elegance, deadpanned Rimondi, describing the design duos latest collection for Fay, which is one part of the Tods empire. It was also an apt phrase to describe many of the showgoers outfits as heavy rainstorms lashed the city on its first day of runway shows, causing inevitable traffic havoc and wardrobe mayhem.\n",
      "But chaotic is not a word one would ordinarily use to describe these designers aesthetic, which tends to be defined by pristine, prettified clothes. This season their deft precision was worked on the military field jacket, a small point of reference, and its myriad possibilities. Where a chaotic notion entered, it was in setting the rigor of combat garb against traditional paisley curlicues, embroidery, ruching, and prints that had a shade of Bloomsbury about them. The elongated sleeve proportions added a more youthful element to the uniform improvisation.\n",
      "Floral-print dresses and pretty separates, like a cute blush suede frock, came with scalloped sleeves and cutout paisley swirls. To counter some of that girlishness, and with a knowing nudge to the designers desire to add a younger following to their loyal clientele, the Fay field jacket will likely have mass appeal. It hit their runway in numerous iterations: cropped and in a more urban denim version, in white. There were navy incarnations, too, and a series of embroidered styles had a semblance of Tyrolean influence. A small idea for a larger world.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Felder Felder,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"What if the Lisbon sistersthe five doomed girls at the center of The Virgin Suicideshad never killed themselves? Imagining an alternate, happier history for the Lisbons inspired the Spring collection of Felder Felder, the London-based brand designed by German identical twin sisters Daniela and Annette Felder. In their version, the Lisbons party their way from Michigan to Miami and age disgracefullythink: The Golden Girls gone wild. The oily blue in the metallic fabric of their first outfits, a sharply cut broad-lapel suit and follow-up dresses, shone sickly slick. Banana palm and flamingo prints, appliqus, and jacquards were scrambled and diffused as if squinted at through aging eyes. \n",
      "There was a potent dose of the staple Felder fare that their lushly blow-dried regulars had come to whoop for: floor-length underwear revealers, skater skirts with cutaways at the hip, crop tops aplenty, and a chiffon baby doll. Yet there was a pitch at maturity, toothis show was about the Lisbons growing up, after allin a suite of Art Baselappropriate cream looks in silk jersey, twisted only by the odd Lurex-piped panel or cry-for-help undone shirt. A tomato, pink, and white color-block aside was carefully conventional. And despite the artificial whoa there! clash of pink, apricot, and gold in their tropical jacquard, the fabric was used to hew restfully nipped dresses, pencils, and outerwear. \n",
      "Afterward, Annette Felder observed that this kind of harmonious dichotomy is something the designers do naturally: Its always hard and its always soft, and that comes from our being twins. So whos the hard sister and whos the gentler one? It changes! both chimed into avoid being hard on each other.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Fendi,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Sick, although in quite agoodway. Thats the only possible response to the coral leather mini-bloomer playsuit that proceeded fourth in the Fendi collection today. Coral. Leather. Bloomer. Playsuit. Such a thing could no doubt cause ridicule, offense, or even pity if viewed on the everyday street. Yet when seen with our fashion glasses on, we can instantly perceive that this garment has precisely the right number of attractive-repulsive features to qualify it as ideally avant-garde. It has the puff-shoulder sleeves, the 80s-yet-not yoke, the gathering into a high-neck nearly-but-not-Victorian collar. While below, it provides exactly the correct amount of photographer-attractor leg exposure to satisfy girls who congregate at and outside fashion shows. \n",
      "Fendi is a serious Roman fur and leather house of long standing, but recently Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi have been having some fun with it all. There are no references, remarked Lagerfeld as he moved through the roiling postshow throng. Retro is over, no?\n",
      "Still, even when hes supposedly designing against the mainstream, Lagerfelds antennae cant help transmitting a sense of the fashion news that is running through Spring. It was there in the silhouettesthe big-sleeved, high-neck, high-waisted, and pleated midi thing thats currently going on. In Fendis case, they provide the backdrop for ultra-luxurious house materials and skills: summer furs in a rattan-basketwork open-weave technique, cropped jackets in whipstitched patchwork python and braiding and smocking effects. Fendi x Karl Lagerfeld may be 50 years old as a collaboration, but in some ways its still ridiculously, friskily young. Again, in a good way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,For Restless Sleepers,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 28, 2015\",\"The palazzo pajama was originally created by Irene Galitzine, a cultivated Russian princess turned couturiere who lived in Rome in the 60s. Her clientele ranged from thegrandesdames of the Roman aristocracy to Audrey Hepburn. Jackie Kennedy was also a fan and sent her a lovely thank-you note in 1963 that read: I was so touched at your thoughtfulness in sending me your marvelous pajamas for Christmas. But it was her friend Diana Vreeland who with her usualpanache gave the chic ensemblea masculine-inspired blouse paired with wide pantsthename thats still used to these days, that has become synonymous with a sensual, androgynous, and eccentric way of dressing.\n",
      "The fashion world has longbeen fascinated bylounge-inspired attire; recently almost every known designerhas tapped into what has become a global trend. But for Francesca Ruffini, a refined woman with a calm demeanor, the passion for pajamas reaches back to her personal lifestyle and to her desire for both comfort and elegance. Ive always lived in a pajama because it has a uniform quality that I find appealing; itsthe first thing I wear when coming back home after a day outside, she said during the presentation of her Spring collection, held in her sprawling flat in the heart of Milan. Her pajamas are veritable pantsuits that can be worn 24/7, carrying you from day to night, or can be worn as separates: I likethe monogrammed jackets of my custom-made pajamas with a demure midi skirt; the pants look great with a tailored blazer, said the designer, while pointing out a lineup in sumptuous silks sourced in her native Como and printed exclusively in festive colors. Each lookwas accessorized by a sleeping mask that couldmorph into a graceful headband. To further demonstrate the already convincing versatility, Ruffini expanded the range with fluid robes de chambre (read: bathrobes) in elongated linesmade in liquid, languid jacquards, they were perfectto be worn as dusters or evening dresses. The effect was of subtle yet alluring seduction. She also added a bra to wear under the coats: I hate the look of exposed lingerie! she exclaimedin mockhorror. But my husband encouraged me to add a sexy-yet-elegant touch to make the look more desirable. The husband in question is Remo Ruffini, CEO of Moncler, who actually happens to know a thing or two about making a successful fashion business: His suggestions on the subject cannot be easily overlooked.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Frame Denim,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"For a line that has made its name setting the denim trends, beginning with its first pairthe ubiquitous Le Skinny Jean of 2012Frame Denims Spring 2016 presentation began with surprisingly few. Actually, there werent many bottoms at all. The new pant is no pant, laughed cofounder Jens Grede at the Soho presentation, or is it the Emperor's New Pants?\n",
      "Whatever the takeaway, it would have been easier if the models didnt look so good. Nearly all were clad in 70s-influenced separates (often worn, well, quite separately): Tight knit tops and tees had sleeves that extended only to the elbow and tucked into fetching A-line skirts; long, loose jeans were gently cuffed into a more girlfriend-friendly boyfriend jean silhouette; snug knit bikinis were sported under multi-pocketed denim jackets; and slouchy tops were worn seemingly alone, or over the briefest of shorts. It appeared to be, for all practical purposes, a full view into the future wardrobe of every leggy young fashionable thing on the premises, as well as those of the heavily Instagrammed runway regulars after whom they model their wardrobes. \n",
      "The intended feel was that of an American girl who falls in love while visiting the 70s French Riviera then began infusing the local wardrobe with American sportswear tropes, said Grede, name-checking the story of the recording of the Rolling Stones Exile on Main St. (a rundown chateau, exercises in redefining the term louche for a generation), though the Gallic striped tops and thick elastic headbands in some looks certainly nodded to another famous Riviera-ite, namely the classic St.-Tropez bombshell herself, Brigitte Bardot (who, its worth noting, also had no problem with not wearing pants in public). Swimwear was a new venture here, born out of the organic design process that Grede and cofounder Erik Torstensson have pursued since the labels founding: New washes led to new cuts and styles of denim, which in turn inspired a shirt, trousers in suede and leather, and now, swim. Next time well do something else, said Grede. Were going to go darker, cooler. It looks like the emperors have quite a few clothes in their future after all.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Francesco Scognamiglio,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"Born and bred in Naples (in Pompei, no less), Francesco Scognamiglio is still deeply in love with this city of staggering beauty and louche-ness, opposites that coexist in a web of inextricable contradictions. This clearly feels quite natural for the designer, who delves with abandon into Napless history and decadent heritage for inspiration. All that was apparent in his Spring collection, in which he referenced the esoteric Sansevero Chapel, a 16th-century masterpiece that hosts the statue of the Veiled Christa marble wonder that looks so incredibly real, as if it were made of actual flesh draped in the thinnest of fabric. \n",
      "Theater, mirrors, artifice, said the designer backstage, pointing out wispy, ruffled dresses in white and shell pink, light as a feather and almost liquid in their sensuality. Transparent Chantilly lace and inconspicuous point desprit conjured up a romantic feel for fluctuating long dresses, exuding reminiscences of boudoirs and 18th-century courtesansyet they were slashed, layered, and multitiered to modern effect. Black silk mikado jackets with round shoulders felt more substantial; they came inlaid with graphic intarsia inspired by peeling stucco ceilings that looked like cracks through which a delicate jade green lining could be glimpsed. Dresses in white or black liquid satin were printed and embroidered with an oversize iris motif and adorned with an abundance of rosette appliqus; they balanced the overall barely there effect and the nude transparencies of the lineup. The craftsmanship was undoubtedly exquisite. It makes sense that Scognamigliobacked by a new investor, Malaysian entrepreneur Johann Youngwill debut his Haute Couture collection in Paris in 2016, where hell finally fulfill a childhood dream.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Gabriela Hearst,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Barneys New York has installed Gabriela Hearsts debut collection on its third floor, between Chlo and Cline. Not bad for a fledgling label in its first season. Hearst arrives on the scene with a pedigree; she hails from a grand Uruguayan ranching family and shes married to a descendant of William Randolph Hearst, but this is no vanity project. The proof is in that Barneys exclusive, and in her evolving collection. When she launched the line in February, it was tempting to classify Hearst as another Phoebe Philo disciple, a practitioner of the luxe minimal style that has dominated at retail for the past few years. But a season later, a distinct point of view is emerging, one that marries an urbane elegance with a rawer, even rustic look that nods at her heritage. That difference will work to Hearsts advantage, especially as the fashion pendulum swings away from restraint toward a more exuberant sensibility.\n",
      "There were any number of understated, smartly cut coats and coatdresses here, and theyll find plenty of customers when this collection lands on sales floors. So, too, will the streamlined strapless evening column with a built-in choker necklace (it connects to the dress in back). Inevitably, though, the items that made a stronger statement were the ones for which Hearst took bigger risks. A tank dress with floor-sweeping proportions was cut in Lurex-striped gauzebeach fabric, she called it, adding, It makes me feel comfortable when somethings not so perfect. Hearst should continue to follow that instinct. A rugged washed-cotton field jacket was one of the collections most desirable pieces. Elsewhere, she took cues from her husbands cycling uniform for a ribbed-knit cashmere dress in bold, athletic stripes. Sexy as hell, it will stand out among the sea of knits about to inundate the runways, and its one more reason Hearst should keep going her own way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Gabriele Colangelo,Kerry Olsen,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Its the rare bird who admits hes not interested in dressing exhibitionists, but Gabriele Colangelo is one such individual. Theres no sparkling embroidery here, quipped the meticulous Italian backstage. Listening to the designer, who hails from a family of furriers, animatedly describe his seasonal fabric innovations is an uncommon experience. For his Spring collection, utilizing technology to an extent seldom seen, he shifted his attention to experiments with velvet (laser-cutting it to resemble the age-old dvor technique) and kidassia (aka goats fur), transporting the materials into shape-shifting textiles and remarkable summer statement pieces.\n",
      "The overall silhouette was long and lean; narrowly pleated silk tunics were paired with contrastingly hued trousers in lavender, copper, turquoise, and an eye-catching mustard. Sleeveless tops, velvet-accented slip dresses, and a wonderful velvet jumpsuit possessed a similarly elongated feel. Symmetry was occasionally broken by the unexpected tweaking of a jackets sleeves, many of which had extended cuffs.\n",
      "One of Colangelos most interesting new fabrications is a variation of Kentethe West African cloth produced in narrow overlapping strips and usually woven of cotton, silk, and sometimes gold thread. Colangelos version is distinguished by sheared silk threads, which from a distance resemble fur. He used the fabric to create wispy coats, trousers, and jackets that were pretty and light as a feather. Many of the outfits that followed were similarly tonal and textural, at times employing pleats under transparent silk or creative use of kidassia: For a handcrafted feel, he applied the tufty tone-on-tone material to necklines and hems or worked it as stripes, adding a 70s undercurrent and an enticing, of-the-moment feel.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Gareth Pugh,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Youre so money. Recall, if you will, that unforgettable line from Swingers, delivered in the midst of a pep talk at a nightclub. Money is the primary way we denote value in our society. Youre so money means you have so much value. You are so very good. Gareth Pughs latest collection was so, so money. Literally, in that there were actual pence coins sewn onto the clothesa gesture that, in a different collection, youd be tempted to read as a statement about luxury, or something along those lines. But Pughs money wasnt raising questions. It was proposing a solution: Go out. Go balls out. Dress to the nines, as though everything this world has to offer belongs to you, because it does. You can buy whatever you want with the currency that is you. Be extravagant with yourself, and for gods sake, have fun.\n",
      "The high spirits of this collection, meanwhile, raised a question: What on earth got into Gareth Pugh this season? Heading backstage after this exuberant, brilliantly styled show, you half-expected to find Pugh bouncing off walls and singing the praises of a new cocktail of serotonin reuptake inhibitors or, better yet, a new love. The truth was rather more prosaic. Pugh was up to some point-making here: We each contain multitudes, was his message, and reputedly dour Gareth Pugh is perfectly capable of putting his well-developed design muscles to work in the creation of a collection with a disco mood, just as the Gothic Gareth Pugh babes hes cultivated see fit, once in a while, to slough off their cares and paint the town red. \n",
      "Red was Pughs signature color this season. The color pulsed through numerous looks, from the impeccably tailored silk faille suits, with their flared, attenuated silhouettes, to the paillette-covered short-shorts made for shimmying. The paillettes made perhaps their most stunning appearance in a trim black trench coatthe way the sequins dappled about the coats chest and shoulders suggested the movement of strobe lights dancing over pitch-colored clothes. The nightclub atmospherics extended into Halston-esque draped dresses and looks in a black-and-white diamond patterned jacquard that conjured the undying incandescence of club deity Leigh Bowery. The nightclub energy was present, too, in Pughs excellent, Mongolian furtrimmed plastic jackets, with their frisson of sexual possibility (and perversity). The overall effect was magnificently louche.\n",
      "Pugh clearly knew hed be shocking the audience by sending out a collection premised on the pleasure principle. Did he know hed be showing them perhaps his best collection ever? He probably knew that, too. Pugh should engage his gaudy side more oftenhere he demonstrated that his rigor as a craftsman can turn pretty much any look into pure class. His artistry is so money. And Pugh has more where that came from: He can afford to spend freely.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Gary Graham,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Displacement as a positive force? Its a theme that, in one way or another, has often coursed through Gary Grahams clothes. His keenly researched collections contain multitudes, with enough references to make an art history majors head spin. A brief shopping list of a few of his aesthetic touchstones for this season: the word asunder, Buddhist vestments, Iranian carpets, historical mourning garb, seminal experimental filmmaker Jack Smith, and Queen Elizabeth I.\n",
      "Generally speaking, Graham weaves together such disparate ideas with ease. Despite his period fodder, the results are unplaceable in time and geography. Take silk dresses, in an ornate print borrowed from the aforementioned Iranian rugs, or a trapeze maxi inspired by a traditional Turkish wedding dress. Paneled in black and shimmering gold, it was easy to imagine on some cool young thing at one of the citys artier events. His message got perhaps a bit muddled in a mixed-media top that married Victorian mutton-chop sleeves, tapestry, and ticking stripes. More winning were dresses in perfectly polished shapes but with plenty of grungy appeal, splattered with bleach till they reached an uncanny shade of goldenrod. Transformation of another kind was afoot in a grouping of items that riffed on the idea of remnants. Graham had lately been reading Chlo Griffins oral history of Cookie Mueller, and he tapped into the books descriptions of a thrift store in Muellers native Baltimore. The resulting pieces came edged in all manner of metallic sundries.\n",
      "Particularly savvy was Grahams decision to build out his offering of pieces that boast a broad appeal but make more of a statement than your pure basics. A pair of ethereal blouses, a poet number with full sleeves, and a sleeveless top with a slashed, sheer high neckline both fit the bill, as did his supple Peruvian knits in a graphic black-and-white pattern inspired by tile work. Grahams lookbook styling may have an editorial loftiness to it, but there was a surprising amount of real-world potential to the majority of these clothes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Giamba,Alessandra Codinha,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"How do you explain a thing like the red-white-and-bluestriped sequin hot pants at Giamba today? Or, for that matter, the sequined lipstick bullets; the sequined red-painted fingernails on embroidered hands; the sequined stars, daisies, planets, hearts, and stars? Well, if youre Giambattista Valli, you point to legendary 1990s New York club Jackie 60, to Donna Jordan, to Tom Wesselmann, and, above all else, to the #FreeTheNipple movement. Its really all about Free the Nipple! Valli exclaimed backstage after the show, and to some degree, it really was. The very abbreviated frilly hippie frocks the little sister customer (that is, in relation to his big girl Giambattista Valli line and, one supposes, adored child to his big mama couture collection) has come to expect from Giamba were here again, only this time with heart- and star-shaped patches-as-pasties, much in the manner of the emoji carefully placed by your favorite bare-it-all Instagram star. Think an aristocratic Miley Cyrus.\n",
      "Some models had their lanky, pale hair raked through with pastel pink and lilac dye, as if they were members of the Source Family who ran off to Burning Man and never came back. Some wore zebra-striped ankle socks with sequined shoes, or tutu-style skirts with sweatshirts. There may not have been an immediately available narrative through-line, but going out clubbingor freeing the nippleis, after all, chiefly concerned with celebrating a certain joie de vivre. And really, what are those stars and stripes (even when sequined as a bustier or brief) about, if not freedom?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Giambattista Valli,Chioma Nnadi,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Giambattista Valli has been tending toward a more sixties silhouette in the past few seasons, and his familiar full-skirted looks made way for a sharper, Youthquakeinspired line today. The Italian designer likes to surround himself with a circle of stylish women that spans generations, and two of his favorites sat in the front row todayLee Radziwill and Bianca Brandolini DAdda.\n",
      "There was an air of romance about the collection that is likely to appeal to both those women, starting with the pretty Art Nouveauinspired florals that were present on everything from balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses to neat, cropped trouser suits. Beyond a penchant for floral prints, intricate embellishments are a Valli sweet spot, and shimmering 3-D petals found their way onto the thigh-grazing miniskirts and mixed-media A-line coats.\n",
      "Naturally, Valli designs with a glamorous social calendar in mind, and finding new ways to invigorate a black-tie dress code is always on his agenda. The silk scarves that topped the bohemian floor-sweeping dresses made for an unexpected alternative to the traditional statement collar. With their eye-catching, glittering soles, the gladiators were a charming and modern re-envisioning of the evening sandal, one thats sure to have legs on the red carpet come spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Giles,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Lets start with the last look. Because that laser-cut, micro-pleated, satin organza gown goes a long way toward explaining what was going on at the Giles show tonight: Flame-haired Karen Elson emerged, looking to all the world like the genetic clone of Queen Elizabeth I, reanimated to preside over some postapocalyptic England (or, at any rate, a United Kingdom of which Elizabeths thorn-in-the-side, Scotland, is no longer a part). And that was precisely Giles Deacons point. The show was held in the Elizabethan-era Banqueting Room in Whitehall, a place to which the designer would often retire as a student to get away from hustle and bustle and take in the Rubens murals on the ceiling. Hed booked the space for this season a year in advance, and a deep dive into the history of the place led him back to Elizabeth, and provided him the inspiration for his new clothes.\n",
      "In other words, this time out, Deacon was in one of his historical moods. Its a frame of mind that usually results in maximal looks, and on that score this collection did not disappoint. Working with print designer David Holah of Bodymap, Deacon created a print based on a scan of a full-length portrait of Elizabeth I, which found its way onto silhouettes as varied as a leotard-taut bodysuit and a diaphanous caftan. There were also Baroque wallpaper florals and embroideries based on tapestries. But the real drama here was mainly to be found in the collections skirts and sleeves. Deacon didnt stint on the volume, cutting full bell- and balloon-shaped sleeves and frothing his skirts and dresses with parachute hems or underlying layers of tulle. The patterned tights made for a nice complement to all that volume, and they conjured a masculine Renaissance-era look.\n",
      "Then there were the showpieces. Alongside the satin organza gowns worn by Elson and Erin OConnor, Deacon displayed his couturier skills in dresses embellished by an overgrown English gardens worth of tulip-shaped florets and finished other, more plainspoken dresses with tender little frills. As is often the case at Giles, the showboating craft threatened to become the collections whole point, and this season, that threat was particularly acute: The construction of a gown in a brown-toned, understated print could wow you, but the same material, done up into a matter-of-fact silk jumpsuit, underwhelmed. It would have been nice to see Deacon apply more of his attention and artistry to his straightforward looks. The designer was at his best here when he pulled out all the stops, and anytime he did, it was impossible not to be swept up in his storytelling. One sight of Elson in that gown, and all quibbles were forgotten.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Giorgio Armani,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 28, 2015\",\"Giorgio Armani continued his 40th-anniversary festivities this afternoon with a press conference and lunch in honor of his new self-titled book of family photographs and personal remembrances. The 81-year-old designer was in a celebratory frame of mind, even making a joke about his nose: I was born with it, he said, pointing to the baby picture hanging behind him onstage. But if the press conference was a moment for reflection, and his recently opened museum is the repository for four decades worth of designs, today's runway show wasn't the walk down memory lane that might've been expected.\n",
      "Instead, Armani chose a color little associated with his work, red, and made it the focus of a collection that was also noteworthy for its lightness, a quality that happens to be synonymous with him. His notes specified shades of flame, lacquer, and geranium, and more often than not he juxtaposed them with navy, icy gray, and white. Coupled with graphic treatments like woven stripes, polka dots, and lozenge embroideries, the palette gave the show a shipshape clarity quite in contrast to the hazy pastels of the Emporio Armani collection he presented last week.\n",
      "Where the Emporio show was awash with pants, here he was interested in walking shorts and abbreviated, full skirts. The trousers he did put on the runway were almost sheer and layered over opaque leggings for a look that was more discreet than seen elsewhere this season. (A see-through skirt or two showed off more than he probably bargained for.) Tailored one-button jackets in that same filmy material were the best pieces in the collection. Though they were rather elaborately stitched with glinting glass beads and silk cord embroidery, they, too, looked airy and weightless, a real feat.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Giulietta,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Tennis-loving cyborgs are taking over! Or rather, they did today on the runway at Giulietta, where designer Sofia Sizzi imagined the sport and its aesthetics, as well as robots, through the lens of Courrges, sending out an army of mod-looking automotons in punchy crimson, cobalt, green, and white. There were sweet, cropped off-the-shoulder tops and culottes, a great T-shirt dress with a tennis skirt, and a kicky blue mini that flashed the crimson of inset pleats. Giulietta has been long distinguished by a certain vintage-loving quirk that carries through to silhouettes, but this season things took a surprising turn toward the body-conscious: strappy bodysuits and hourglasses dresses abounded. \n",
      "Sizzis tennis references were subtly used, though they were easy to spot if you knew to look for them: bold white stripes seemed to have leapt straight off the courts and onto skirt hems and the legs of pants. The lace of a pair of emerald flares was a riff on tennis balls and nets, as was the collections lovely closing look, a beige evening gown whose organza skirt came studded with big, glossy cabochons. Robots got a nod in geometric jewel and Plexiglass breastplate-like embellishments. But androids arent without their flaws. They have no hearts, for one. And while this collection surely had heart to it, in places it felt a little bloodless. Giuliettas idiosyncracies have served the label well before; heres hoping well see more of them come Fall.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Givenchy,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"As more than a thousand people traversed the rush hourchoked West Side Highway and flooded onto Pier 26all dressed to the nines (or maybe the threes or twos, given the skimpiness of a few notable looks)its fair to say that one of the very last things they were expecting was to be immersed in a contemplative experience. Yet this is what they got from Riccardo Tisci on the night he brought his Givenchy show to New York City, coinciding with the 14th anniversary of 9/11. There was no all-out gig from Rihanna and Kanye West (as had been the speculation when performances were mentioned), and no inaugural walk from Caitlyn Jenner, which had been optimistically rumored, given Tiscis strong credentials as fashions first champion of transgender models. \n",
      "Instead, with the aid of his coconspirator, the artist Marina Abramovic, and the cooperation of a staggering sunset across the Hudson, Tisci made his show into a meditation on the losses of 9/11, and on slowing things down in our heads, perhaps to mourn, but also to remember how lucky we are to be alive. The audiencethe seated professionals and celebrities, and the standing publicwere made to wait and watch for a good hour, absorbing the spectacle of blue sky and white and pink-tinted clouds as Abramovics slow-moving performers, dressed in white shirts and black pants, acted out simple, strenuous, and repetitive ritualsone with a ladder, another with a tree, a third with a faucet gushing water. Stop! Abramovic seemed to be saying. Slow down and feel something! And meanwhile, in the foreground, the nonstop parade of personalities kept coming, and kept on being photographed and Instagrammed. \n",
      "As far as style is concerned, this was also Tiscis opportunity to revisit and refine the ideas hes been working through for his whole career. This yearin which a Givenchy store opens in New York Cityis Riccardo Tiscis tenth at the house, and there was a serene sense of celebration and coming of age amongst the clothes. It was a collection which spelled out and repeated almost-calligraphic black and white variations of the same sentences: Ivory slip dresses and rouleau-strapped camisoles with lace edges, worn over excellently tailored black pants cut to taper gently over pointed shoes. Supple crepe tuxedo jackets with tails, soft kimono coats, and transparent organdy trenches glimmering with jet embroidery. Many, many body-skimming sparkly silver shifts.\n",
      "Aficionados of Tiscis track record in Paris would also have re-applauded the most spectacular of his couture dressesone with a degrade feather effect, and another with leather patches applied on tulle in the shape of alligator skinwhich had never before been shown on live models (as opposed to showroom dummies). And then there was the face decoration, taken to the nth degree of freakishly beautiful elaboration, in studded golden jewelry, tulle frills, and lace.\n",
      "That calm exposition of skill and taste, which surely grows out of nineties memories, will stay in the minds of everyone who was on Pier 26 tonight. The tragedy of 9/11 can never be overwritten by any fashion showand nor should it bebut at the same time, anyone who condemns fashion for concerning itself with current feelings is wrong, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Greg Lauren,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"By now, you know what to expect from a Greg Lauren show. Vintage military fabrics, pieced-together jackets, hip-slung trousers, and hand-distressing are his brands unwavering signatures. Theyre working for him, too: Before taking their seats, a dozen editors and admirers milled around Moynihan Station decked out in his vagabond layers, so there was no confusing which stage was his.\n",
      "Other labels have begun to embrace a sort of deconstructed, nomadic look (Yeezy comes to mind), but Laurens take is less severe than many of his contemporaries. Where other shows might have felt provocative and a bit dark, Laurens outlook was all about moving forward while honoring the past and inspiring people to think about clothes differently. That came through stronger than ever in his Spring presentation, which opened with a captivating performance by 10-year-old dancer Lil'Mini Phoenix, set to Nick Drakes Way to Blue. I saw her dance a couple months ago and knew I wanted her to open my show, Lauren said backstage. Shes an example of this next generation of strong females who are saying, Dont tell me what I should be or aspire to. I really believe women are leading the way in creativity, leadership, artevery discipline. Theyre breaking boundaries, changing stereotypes.\n",
      "How did that sentiment translate into the clothes? Laurens women always look powerful in their army drabs and rumpled suits, and there were plenty of those here. But an expanded evening range gave the designer the chance to inject a little more sex appeal: An ivory body-skimming silk gown looked 90s-era minimal at first, but there were billowing swaths of parachute fabric spliced into the back. I wanted there to be flow, he explained. There were also subtle dance references, like a champagne dress with hand-placed strips of silk on the bodice, which mimicked the casual but intentional way a dancer laces up her pointe shoes. The final look was Laurens most experiential to date: The halter neckline of a fluid jet-black silk dress was sculpted, cast in resin, and then plated with gunmetal. He described it as part relic, part liquid metal, but on a simple, beautiful silhouette. It would make an interesting red carpet choice, but our moneys also on the silk lounge pants and robe coat, which offered a softer spin on the tuxedo.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Gucci,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"The incoming march of a new generation in Italy has begun, and the fashion world finds itself standing back spectating on the sudden arrival of a multicolored, sparkly, life-affirming parade. Alessandro Michele is in the spotlight as the Pied Piper of changea risk-taker and revolutionary who has not so much wiped the slate clean at Gucci as doodled all over it, colored it in, stuck sequins on it, and tied it up with a grosgrain bow. His Spring lineup was a very much amplified, filled-in, decorated, and dazzling accessorized extension of the girly, geeky, vintage-like collection that he launched last season in the incongruously dark nightclubby surroundings of the show space the company had been using since the 90s, when Tom Ford was grooving the disco 70s at the brand. As Michele said backstage, surrounded by a visual kaleidoscope of glittery, flower-embroidered satin, chiffon, Lurex knits, brocades, and trimmings, Its a big trip! Of course I am interested in personal style and quirkiness. There are things here that look vintage, but dont really exist as vintageits the illusion of it. Im not nostalgic! Id like to shake it up again.\n",
      "Michele is having none of the slick Gucci aesthetic that descended down through the tenure of his predecessor and former boss, Frida Giannini. This time, he led his army of Gucci girls into the open air and constructed an aristo-domestic set, with a printed carpet against the backdrop of a disused train depota plot of broken-down, old industrial Milan which, if we are to be romantic about it, seemed something like a metaphor for Italian regeneration. \n",
      "What Michele is doing is certainly very Italian, in its references, which (if we are to be geeky about history) run the gamut from Missonis Lurex knits to Roberta di Camerino to Walter Albini and generally use the wonderful era of expressively luxe postwar dressmaking fabrics as a playground. Michele said he has been thinking about the Renaissance and the 1970sboth great eras for Italy in their own waysbut that his whole point is to express personality and emotion through his clothes. Fashion is close to tenderness, he declared, apologizing for his English. I havent slept for two days! \n",
      "No wonder. Apart from his sweeping in of a whole new aesthetic, the vast variety of components in the collection must have kept Michele and his teamsand the shoe, bag, hat, eyewear, and trimmings communities of Italyworking around the clock for months. The results are mesmerizing close-up: Gucci loafers that get pearl-studded heels, damask slip-ons with ridged soccer soles, green boots with flared heels and ghillie laces in rococo blue satin, a pair of Mary Janes with studs made of bullet casings. Thats just for starters. If Gucci manages to supply even a fraction of all this stuff to its stores worldwide, it could have riotous demands on its hands.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Guy Laroche,Dan Thawley,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"The heritage of Guy Laroche reads blurry at best in our collective consciousness, so when London-based designer Adam Andrascik took the reins of the storied house earlier this year, it was his turn to write a new set of rules. From that first outing, it was already clear his vision dramatically overstepped the Parisienne tropes of Monsieur Laroches couture past, driving a more youthful, urban sensibility that returned in his second collection for Spring. \n",
      "Stretching a tall tale of tropical dystopia to describe his sophomore effort, Central Saint Martinstrained Andrascik showed an upbeat cross-section of ladylike daywear collaged with wartime references, such as the khaki jacquards traced with palm fronds that occasionally returned as mirrored appliqus for evening. Swinging between touches of military detailing and ultra-feminine froufrou, his barely there shirting, off-the-shoulder jackets, and miniskirts benefited from the strictness he employed via brass button symmetry, yet faltered into unnecessary complication when ruching and knotted hemlines took center stage. \n",
      "Among the complex slice-and-dice of dvor jacquards and muddy striped separates, Andrasciks talent with a biker jacket rose once again to the fore, with that Laroche staple energized in multiple permutations today. In leather, it featured a daring cutout shoulder and chain details (perhaps a sultry choice for Jada Pinkett Smith, who sat front row in Falls gold-dipped sweaterdress), yet for Andrascik it seems the more streamlined, the better. Cases in point: a Perfecto lapel folding down a straight, double-collar coatdress and a series of scooped-back shirts. They channeled that same millennial grunge that his double-waistband denim captured in spades.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Haider Ackermann,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"The timing couldnt have been better. Just as the models streamed out together for Haider Ackermanns finale, the clouds broke outside the Palais de Chaillot and sunshine poured in through the giant Eiffel Towerfacing windows, lighting up a parade of gorgeous pastel panne velvet. Ackermann has a reputation as Pariss broodiest artiste, known for a dark, moody palette and a penchant for draping that sometimes errs on the droopy side. He was up to something a bit different today, and it started with his dreamily hued velvetin lemon yellow, blush pink, pale blue, and lilacwith punk-but-pretty mohawks to match. Weve seen color play a starring role at other shows this week, notably Dries Van Noten and Lanvin, but here it was an authentic surprise. Its likely nobody walked in wanting a pair of green chartreuse satin pants with a dusty pink and faded blue waistband, but some of us walked out that way. \n",
      "The other virtue of this collection was its diversity. Jacket-wise, Ackermann put a lot of options on the runway, from shrunken leather motos to languid mens dressing gowns to a double-breasted blazer trim enough to tuck into trousers. Pant styles, meanwhile, ranged from Friday night at the club (black leathers) to Sunday morning at Les Puces (frayed and patched cargos). Only laser-cut leggings stood out as a mistake in a lineup that was otherwise pretty free of them. The lacy pantyhose peeking out from under waistbands was a styling effect, strictly runway only. Dresses werent the focus, but the ones he did show scored high on the wearability meter, especially a bias-cut black velvet number worn with a matching jacket.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Halston Heritage,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Everything old is new again at Halston Heritage. For Pre-Fall an archival feather hat designed by the late, legendary Roy Frowick set the gears turning, and for Spring it was a vintage Halston silk scarf in a macro orchid print that inspired creative director Marie Mazelis. At todays preview she also namechecked Cuba, specifically referring to the candy-colored, crumbling splendor captured in photographer Robert Polidoris images of Havana. The jetsetting appeal of recent seasonsinspirations have lately included Halstons jaunts to China and Acapulcohas done plenty to increase the glamour quotient at the brand, and it did so here, too, if subtly. That orchid scarf led to larger-than-life prints (Halston was known to spend around six figures a year to keep his studio full of his favorite blooms), which were used on blouses and diaphanous caftans. The Polidori pictures informed Mazeliss palette of aquamarine, coral, and tangerine. \n",
      "Movement was central here, whether in the accordion-pleated chiffon overlay that topped one simple sheath, or the fistfuls of jangling paillettes on the shoulders of another. At times it felt like the HH team stuck too literally to the shapes of Halstons seventies salad days with their one-shouldered frocks, plunging halter dresses, and wide-leg glamour-puss jumpsuits. Next season it might be worth adding a bit of that eras gleeful hedonism into the mix.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Hellessy,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"The woman for whom Hellessy is designed does not wear short shorts, said Sylvie Millstein during the presentation of her latest collection, and she certainly wont have to. Long, fluid gowns in striped cotton-linen and ochre-colored silk commingled with easy, blush-toned pajama suiting and tuxedo-tailed strapless bodices worn over wide-leg trousers, promoting a different kind of cool entirely. An off-the-shoulder blouse with a thick black band across the chest and creamy white poet sleeves gathered at the cuffs, a light silk trench in that same shade of ochre boasting a literal twist of fabric at the back: It was a vision of summer in the city where the frayed hems come on the edges of a boxy, tailored T-shirt-style topnot your cutoffs. \n",
      "The presentation took place in Chelsea at Lori Bookstein Fine Art, where fate would have it that the current showHiroyuki Hamada: Paintings, opening September 10served as a kind of underlining to Millsteins aesthetic philosophy: an artful approach to a certain elegant restraint. Its about not doing too much, said the designer, who looked to colors found in a city summer and primarily relied on all-natural fibers (linen, cotton, silkand really, what more do you need in the sultriest of seasons?). She found her inspiration in the rooftop parties that absorb New Yorkers social lives from June through September, with all of the skylines sparkle (here seen in a V-neck cocktail-ready cotton lam shift, its Art Deco silhouette echoing the era of some of Manhattans most lauded skyscrapers) and upward thrust (represented by the bold vertical stripe of a column dress and mid-calf-length extended pajama shirt tunic) implied therein.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Heohwan Simulation,Tiziana Cardini,NEW YORK,\" October 15, 2015\",\"Fashion history is Hwan Heos obsession. The Korean designer has a quite nerdy approach, considering his almost scholarly zeal in referencing a precise fashion decade for each collection: I call it the Critique Collection Project because the process is close to a research or a study, he said during a presentation of his Spring lineup. Every Critique Collection is numbered, like chapters in a fashion history book. He has already reached Critique Collection Project n.9, which was dedicated to the Great Depression. Not a very lighthearted subject, but the designer was undeterred. He found a picture from the 30s of a little girl working in a factory, imagining her dreaming of being free and playful instead of having to face such a harsh reality. Hence a collection where the severe tailoring of masculine workwear (in pursuit of historical truth, real cutting patterns of that era were used as references) was softened by the use of fun, feminine colors. Ribbons and strings added a gentle yet playful touch, allowing the outfits to be transformed in a constellation of diverse silhouettes, following the personal mood of the wearer. In another literal nod to the prohibitions of that time, not a bit of fabric was wasted. Instead of trimming the excess material, the ingenious Hwan Heo made it into a multitude of inventive shapes, leaving the ends loose and un-hemmed. Case in point was a voluminous coat in black-and-white houndstooth jacquard with an orange belt; apparently it was cut as a geometric square, but on closer inspection it revealed hidden wings made from uncut fabric, folding and cascading on the sides for a graceful ruffled effect.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Herms,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Trying to describe Herms is an exquisite form of torture to a non-French person. Somehow, the foreign tongue (I mean English) simply cannot find words to explain the ingeniously crafted, superfine fabrics and leather it uses without sounding pretentious (a well-known Anglophone phobia). Even worse, the values of the house are so restrained and so coded as to be next to undetectable to the uninitiated. Being in on them involves far more than being alert to the occasional H logo on top of a bag strap, or congratulating oneself for recognizing that Herms silk scarves are being incorporated into clothing, as Nadge Vanhee-Cybulski did (again) this season. \n",
      "In a nutshell, Herms is the essence of the cultivated, inbred French point of view that if you have wealth, it must be spent so that it doesnt show except to those of your class. And by the way, a woman must never blunder by trying to be sexy, appear to wear makeup, or have done hair. Foreign women are half-blind to all these nuances, as they run counter to most of our instincts, yet still we are obsessed with cracking the secret codes. Both Kris Jenner and Janet Jackson are apparently amongst the intrigued: They were onhand at the show to view how Vanhee-Cybulski would set out the Herms principles for Spring. \n",
      "She did it with a simplified sequence of blue-black tailoring and grid-patterned black-on-cream tops and pants, and mustard-color dresses in cotton and leather, accessorized with large quartz and clear resin cuffs. Something of Vanhee-Cybulskis background as a former design director for The Row figures in here: Shes brought a sense of relaxed city-sportiness to the picture, showing Herms trainers with many looks and dialing back on the horsey heritage for the moment. Its not showy fashion that is being sold here; more a carefully calibrated sense of a lifestyle which consciously rises above trendiness. For those who want to belong to it, the quality of the materials will be explained in the ritual of buying at Herms, where the quiet mystique of all this Frenchness is fully laid out.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Herv Lger by Max Azria,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Today was the 30th anniversary of Herv Lger, and show-going lovers of the label shuffled in wearing none other than the houses perennial frock: the bandage dress. The attire was predictable, but creative officer Lubov Azria threw onlookers for a loop when it came to the runway: There wasnt a bandage dress in sight. We were thinking, How do we evolve this line on the runway, where we didnt do one bandage technique?  said Azria backstage.\n",
      "Sure, the decision not to include the popular, body-skimming piece synonymous with the house seemed risky, but Azria managed to keep the DNA of Herv Lger alive in other ways. First, from afar, many of the minidresses looked like bandage dresses and moved like bandage dresses (they barely moved at all). Those features were enough to keep the die-hard lovers of the staple happy. For instance, there were still those hourglass-hugging silhouettes, this time seen in jacquard fit-and-flare frocks, which came in black and cream with crisscross netting dipping down into the dcolletage. But Azria was also able to infuse some new techniques, like floral appliqus on tank dresses, which nicely traced the body to emphasize the waist. There were also some woven cords on a sleeveless dress, slightly curved for a slenderizing trompe l'oeil effect. \n",
      "But it was Azrias introduction of trousers on the catwalk (before, she had only showed leggings) which provided a true dose of cool. Jacquard pants were striped or patterned, flaring out at the kneean effect that seemingly elongated the legsor were woven into slouchy or fitted jumpsuits. The new direction still contained that bold va va voom factor of a bandage dress, but it wasn't as forwardand with it, Azria could potentially gain a new set of fans.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Holly Fulton,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"To witness a designer evolve, improve, and flourish is one of the greatest pleasures of regular show attendance. Today Holly Fulton hit that career-narrative uplift with a collection that put away some of the childish (albeit diverting) tics she had previously favored for a focused yet imaginatively soaring kaleidoscope of clothing. Her inspiration was the artist Eileen Agara name shamefully new to this reviewerwho collaged repetitive patterns taken from nature.\n",
      "Hence the calligraphic ruffles on the starfish-studded opening dresses that echoed the languidly spiraling tail of a seahorse. Or the injection-molded abstract floral silicon appliqus and glinting Swarovski, protoChaos Theory myriads that danced across these carefully proportioned silhouettes. Fultons feel for harmonic color combinations was in tune, and she paid rewarding diligence to often-overlooked categories that included an exactly precise denim and chambray section.\n",
      "Previously, Fulton was lovable for the walk-of-shame, tousled fiercenessvery Londonthat so often inflected itself in her collections. Today that was eclipsed by unapologetic virtuosity. Backstage Fulton said: We were trying to use repetition to create cohesion that reflected the almost psychedelic eccentricity of Agar. My favorite quote from her is Ive enjoyed life and it shows through, like a transparent skirtshe basically spent many of her latter years being semi-naked in translucent garmentsand we tried to incorporate that idea of something strong, feminine, and light.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Hood By Air,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"It was all about childhood in the Caribbean. And growing up around uniforms. We had such high education, and we couldnt do anything with ithigh education and low living quarters. So it was about cutting up and altering that school uniform, as we did. \n",
      "Shayne Oliver was wearing a long, striped knitted column dress as he gave his articulate coda to Hood By Airs radically chopped-up schoolyard collection, after a show to which the notes had been printed on a detention card registering many misdemeanors. A journalist earnestly asked Oliver for his position on gender-neutral clothes, as there had been equal numbers of men and women wearing spliced and suspended skirts and dresses on the runway. Which is meant for which? To Oliver, thats hardly a burning issue anymore. At this point, he replied, patiently, we are wearing Hood By Air, just as part of the family.\n",
      "Its odd how things come around. There was a fashion movement in the 90s called deconstructionism, which mainly came from then-marginalized and poor young designers who bonded in basements in Antwerp and London. In some ways, Hood By Air is their 21st-century successor, working to take apart conventional garments, shrinking the components, and making something new and unrecognizable out of them, using zippers and the language of bondage paraphernalia.\n",
      "Still, Hood By Airs collective way of working is different, and in many ways more successfully social revolutionary than those who went before, many of whom eventually became absorbed into the commercial style of mainstream minimalism. For one thing, HBAs expression is far more exuberantly sexual, fun, and democratic than the intellectually exclusive 90s crew. For another, the HBA ethos is genuinely at the leading edge of a social change that has swept through legislation this year, in ways former generations never have dreamed would come to pass. And for a third: Hood By Air is a brand that actually sells. It doesnt look like highfalutin fashion, butand this would never have happened before eitherits welcomed as part of Fashion Week, recognized as a now-unmissable draw for international buyers and press. One up for the credibility of New York fashion.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,House of Holland,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. Thus begins Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, gonzo maestro Hunter S. Thompsons ever-entertaining account of how not to be a reliable journalist, and the source material for this evenings almost-as-diverting House of Holland show. Strictly, Holland was inspired by the labor-of-love Johnny Depp flick from 1998. So the sometimes jeweled, sometimes embroidered insects that oozed down his clothes were approximations of the hallucinatory special effects mustered for that production, while the bulging ostrich feather shoes and appliqus were nods to the abysmal 70s motel decor Depps Thompson bugged out on in the movie. \n",
      "The first look featured a crazily patched field jacket on a model styled to approximate Thompson himself, and the bucket hats that ran through the collection were more hat-tips to the reprobate author. Head-fry colorful cactus-print shirtdresses, nerd-chic pulled-high sports socks, queasy abstract jacquards and you-really-shouldn't-mix-those color combinations including lime green and orange added to the maximalist overdose. Thompson and Holland, although separated by decades and disciplines, made for intoxicating bedfellows.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Hunter Original,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"If you can remember them afterwards, British music festivals can often be wonderful. Trouble is, they are almost always extremely wet: Forget Burning Man, think Soaked Everyone. Today Alasdhair Willis evoked these dubious delights by creating a runway of trodden mud on which he relived the three stages of typical Brit Festival experience via the medium of clothes.\n",
      "First, optimistic anticipation: In they bounded, wearing ripstop fishtail parkas in sunny dgrad pastels under a deludedly light layer of deconstructed outerwear. This included a powerful remix of the trucker jacket in shades of olive and camo. The shoes, a key category for Hunter, included an interesting hybrid of desert boot and the specially-made Vibram sole used on the labels heaviest-duty Wellingtonhere rendered in pastel panels for fashion consumption.\n",
      "Next, postinevitable downpour, came adaptation: Rubberized coats peppered with drawstring ringlets and botanical flecked semitransparent parkas wreathed in guy rope ribbons were meant, said Willis, to give the impression they had been hastily assembled to fend off the rain. Wellingtons appeared, in more dgrad pastel. Camo parkas in crunchy-to-the-touch treated nylon obscured, rather unfortunately, a fine section of colorful patched gingham shirting.\n",
      "By the end, sheer abandon had set in: Its still raining, but Hell Yeah. A medley of oversized baseball jackets-meet-ponchos came variously peppered with patches (including the Beatles Yellow Submarine) or with suspended fringes of more ribboning.\n",
      "Hunters metamorphosis from farmers favorite to front row draw (Salma Hayek and Luke Evans were among the attendees today) began when Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, and other It Brits started wearing the companys Wellingtons at Glastonbury a decade or so ago. So riffing on that transformative moment seems a fair way to advance Williss ambition to further Hunter as a youthful lifestyle brand. Backstage he recalled his own first festival: Glastonbury, 1985. I saw Echo & the Bunnymen. And it didnt rain! Some guys have all the luck.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,ICB,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Since debuting his first collection for ICB earlier this year, Makoto Takada has carefully cultivated the seeds planted by his predecessor, Prabal Gurung. As he settles in for his third season as design director, Takada is revealing a bit more of his own playful sensibility while still filtering it through the brands working-woman narrative. \n",
      "The starting point for the collection was the photography of Vivian Maier, a Chicago nanny who found success posthumously when undeveloped rolls of film, shot by her in the 50s through the 70s, were discovered and published. But instead of riffing on the retro styles seen in her work, Takada translated the inspiration into a witty exploration of hidden talent and secret fulfillment.\n",
      "Takada liked the idea that Maier, who toiled undiscovered for decades, didnt need anyones affirmation to value herself. So sprinkled through the collection are tiny surprises that only the wearer might notice: a structured blazer pleated so that, in motion, a flash of nude crepe is revealed; a pinstripe constructed from raffia; and black wool trousers with a sheer grid, created using dvor, which revealed a minuscule square of skin. For the woman who buys this, its something she can enjoy just for herself, said Takada.\n",
      "Shirting remains the brands bread and butter, and this seasons pice de rsistance, according to Takada, is a whimsical take on the classic: a blue oxford shirt with a fountain of delicate feathers sprouting from the chest. The feathers had been carefully hand-stitched in India so that they would hover over the fabric like a little cloud. I had this idea of someone who works in the corporate world showing up in this shirtits in the dress code, but also not in the dress code, said Takada. Its that rebellion and irony. It reminds me of how Vivian took photos of regular people, but there was always a narrative.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Iceberg,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Iceberg has seen a long list of designers come and go over the years. Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Marc Jacobs, the Dsquared2 brothers, and Giambattista Valli have all held the top post. Alexis Martial was the most recent recruit until he graduated to Carven earlier this year. Now Arthur Arbesser, who launched his own label a few seasons ago, has assumed the role, and its a sign of his buzz factor, and Milans growing enthusiasm for nurturing local talent, that the turnout in the front row was the best it has been at Iceberg in recent memory.\n",
      "I feel quite honored and happy to be here, Arbesser said backstage, but at the same time I feel [the line] needs a good injection of fun and energy. And a clear message. He certainly brought zest to the endeavor this afternoon, embracing the brands heritage in knits and not skimping on color or pattern either. The bonkers work of the Italian artist Enrico Baj was a jumping-off point, informing the bold print on a silk dress and the plastic badges pinned to the chest of some pieces, creating a loose, sort of military vibe. But the knits are what really resonated. With their preppy-psychedelic sensibility and body-conscious fit, theyll be catnip for the street style posse. Theyll also be a pleasure to wear, which will make them attractive to more restrained types, too. It will be interesting to see what Arbesser does for Fall, when he can really have a go at sweater dressing. We expect to see an even bigger crowd at round two.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Iris van Herpen,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"In the center of Iris van Herpens venue today, lying flat on a plinth, was the actress Gwendoline Christie. The Game of Thrones star remained there motionless for the whole show, even as the trio of animatronic trees surrounding her began to move, as if they were weaving the soft, fishnet-like dress that spread out in a circle around her. Quaquaversal is the name Van Herpen gave her new collection: It means going off in all directions, and backstage she said thats how she approaches her work, collaborating with scientists, artists, biologists, and now performers. \n",
      "Van Herpen is one of contemporary fashions few true conceptual thinkers, one for whom process is as integral as the finished product. Indeed, like Hussein Chalayan this season with his disintegrating dresses, she asked us to reconsider the very notion of a finished product with her growing one. Beyond the performance piece, there was much of interest on Van Herpens runway, where the designer worked hard to combine craftsmanship and technology.\n",
      "She started with sportswear: skirts, tops, a leanly cut little dress. It was normal stuff but for the laser-cutting and hand-weaving. The silhouettes were pure and simple so the materials could shine, and shine they did on crystal-studded chain-link dresses of the Paco Rabanne variety. Only here the chain wasnt chain at all, but a clear synthetic material that made the crystals look as if they were floating without a tether. The most exceptional work came toward the end of the show on a pair of looks as delicate as a fine tracery, with so much negative space they were more not there than there. Laser-cut fishnet gowns appeared to have been made from a weightless silvery metal. With their futuristic aspects, these pieces of Van Herpens will be fitting for Christie when she hits the red carpet for her two holiday blockbusters: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 and Star Wars: Episode VII. This relationship could be very good for both of them.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Iro,Tina Isaac-Goiz,PARIS,\" October 27, 2015\",\"She will always be a rock chick at heart, but its clear that the Iro girl is going placesshe has a real job now, for one, and so does her guy, so they need more daywear options to make it all work.\n",
      "Of course, theyre most likely to be in a field where slim-cut cropped leather trousers and destroy-chic jeans are the norm. When not worn with basic fine-gauge cotton tanks, these might be paired with a breezy popover with openwork details or a multicolored pink print; only the most daringor laid-backwill don the striped shirts with deliberate mothy perforations during office hours. Other pieces, especially the jackets, will go just about everywhere: These included a salt and pepper tweed number with frayed edges, and textured wrap jackets in khaki, ecru, and black, with or without sleeves, cinched by an obi-inspired belt. (For him, spring heralds slim-cut suits, too).\n",
      "Since its inception, Iros biggest star has been the leather bomber, in iterations with cool names like the Ashville, the Zefir, and the Jone. The gangs still all here in neutral colors, although theyre being upstaged by offerings in silver, gold, and saffron that, with a tunic or printed maxi dress swapped in, move easily from the office to a holiday by the beach.\n",
      "Speaking of city and shore, an ever expanding repertoire of flats presented a number of hybrid ideas, from a pointy boot-meets-slide style to a lace-up-as-thong; rounding out the offering were gladiator styles and tennis shoes, this season with an iridescent finish.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Isa Arfen,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Isa Arfen collections never lack for charm. This season, though, designer Serafina Sama laid it on even thicker than usual. Taking her cues from vintage photos of Balinese women, 70s-era exoticism, and rave culture in the 90s, Sama conjured a rather ladylike trip to the tropicsone of the acid variety, perhaps.\n",
      "Sama wasnt particularly literal with her references. The sarong-style wrapping and tops, skirts, and dresses layered with ruffles were one type of nod to Indonesia; the collections copious black-and-white check, it turned out, was another. (Apparently checked textiles are popular in Bali; who knew?) The 70s homage was more abstract, reflected in the airy, hothouse-appropriate shapes of button-downs, coats, and jackets, and in the emphasis on olive drab in the palette. Samas decision to steer away from styles plainly associated with the 70s was cannythere have been umpteen versions of the safari jacket since that legendary collection by YSL, but none like Samas, which came A-line shaped and embellished with graphic grosgrain appliqu. Nor were there any flares here, or, for that matter, any Isa Arfensignature culottes. Samas trouser message this season was crystal clear: capris, capris, capris.\n",
      "Rave culture, meanwhile, was the most abstracted reference of all. Mainly, it contributed to the mix of, as Sama put it, poisonous colors in stripes and a silk-screened tropical floral print. So far, so charming, but the collections real grace notes were to be found in its fabrications, an Isa Arfen specialty. The PVC-coated linen of a printed kimono coat was one standout; another was the crispy cotton blend of the checks. Sama also made a concerted effort to use materials that looked crushed or crumpled, as though theyd been packed into a suitcase. That choice helped to give this rather dressy collection its atmosphere of informality. Ditto the way Sama layered her ruffles all askew. Ditto, too, the fact that this collection, as a whole, came off deeply impractical. Individual pieces could easily be worked into a womans everyday wardrobe, but they seemed aimed more at the woman for whom every day is an adventure. A charmed life, to be sure.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Isabel Marant,Chioma Nnadi,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Isabel Marant pulled together a thumping 80s hip-hop soundtrack for her show today, even though the influences on her new collection skewed more North India than South Bronx. The Parisian designer has made a name for herself by filtering that elusive French girl cool through a distinctly global lens: She was a seasoned traveler from an early age, thanks to her bohemian upbringing, and has a knack for cherry-picking, and then deftly reconfiguring, dress codes and traditions from all four corners of the planet. For Spring, Marants divining stick led her to the rich, colorful textiles of Rajasthan. Its a place the designer has visited for inspiration in the past, but given the free-spirited, eccentric 70s moods that seems to be lingering in the air on the runways, that milieu still feels relevant.\n",
      "That being said, the silhouettes recalled the rounded, billowy shapes of the 80s overall. Style-conscious festival girls who have spent the summer in breezy, vintage-inspired peasant blouses will be swapping out their skinny jeans for harem pants come spring if Marant has her way. The MC Hammer favorite isnt exactly the easiest look to pull off, but in this case the styling was right: Layered up with sequined leggings and elevated with Gorky-style heels, the look took on a new vibe.\n",
      "What with all the sparkling textiles that have been around in the collections, somehow a Lurex gold jumpsuit gathered at the ankle, rolled down to the waist, and worn with a lightweight sweater felt right for now. The global nomad hand of the clothes might have been familiar territory for Marant, but its still likely to give her fans a reason to revisit her store.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Issa,Dan Thawley,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"The pulsing strains of Die Antwoord reverberated through Issas London show space today, the first indication that creative director Jamie OHare was looking at his nature girl through a somewhat twisted lens for Spring, only his second runway outing for the label. Name-checking films like District 9 and Tron backstage, he described the blown-up details lavished across cocktail dresses and Resort separates as both futuristic and organican altogether chilly segue for a brand built on graphic eveningwear, yet one he tempers with swathes of delicate texture and shine.\n",
      "A slew of opening looks paired flat planes of white silk crepe against an encrusted latticework of metallic embroidery, transforming the designers abstract research of stem cell structures into glistening cocktail fare. Later, body-con knits came tiered in black and white bands of lacing and plastic eyelets, creating eye-catching frills and multilayered contours that hugged in all the right places. Balancing that stricter offering, flattering tank dresses fell into handkerchief hems that matched the delicate butterfly effect of lace jersey caftans in cerulean and optic white fractalstheir swirling, architectural prints later morphing into an unfortunate trippy tie-dye that slowed the momentum of an otherwise appealing minimalist streak. It preceded the monotony of slinky wrap dresses that followeddraped concoctions in sheer self-stripe silk, space doughnut prints, and bands of aquarelles that will slip easily into the summer party circuit, though with little fanfare. Pieces like Lily Donaldsons floor-length gown, however (its circuit of jacquard trailed with white lozenges), spoke a little louder of Issas raison dtre: no-nonsense glamour with a bold, feminine allure.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Issey Miyake,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have been experiencing a runway renaissance of late. One place you wont find a straightforward take on the house signature, though, is at Issey Miyake itself: At the brands show, designer Yoshiyuki Miyamae continued to test the horizons of what a pleat can be and do, introducing a new baked stretch technique that molds pleats into the body of a fabric. The most compelling looks in the collection were the ones that featured wavy baked stretch pleats, with contrasting colors printed into the curves; as the sculptural garments moved, they had a spring action, a little like that of a Slinky. The motion was surprising but subtleyou could easily imagine wearing these pieces.\n",
      "The looks with the most instantaneous appeal, however, were the bright, color-blocked ones punctuated with touches of fringe. Miyamae and his team had a tropical theme going here, witnessed in the collections palette, but the raffia textures of the fringed pieces nicely underlined the hothouse atmosphere. There were also net tops with a similarly earthy charman unusual tone for Miyake, a house that hews to a synthetic aesthetic as a rule, but a welcome addition to the brand vocabulary. Pleats remain the star at Issey Miyake, but there are new supporting players.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,J Brand,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" October 22, 2015\",\"The vintage Levis revival currently under way has got premium denim-makers in a bit of a pickle. Do you try to propose an alternative look or offer new jeans that accord with the vintage vibe? J Brand did a bit of both this season, in a collection of denim and ready-to-wear that emphasized time-tested silhouettes. Most of the innovation was in the materials: Head of design Mary Bruno did yeomans work developing ultra-lightweight denims and dyeing and distressing  gossamer cotton-linen blends to look like denim, such that J Brand may indeed find itself with a monopoly on jeans suitable for the dog days of summer. Brunos other key proposals were to offer a trouser jean, which looked particularly natty in optical white, and indigo-dyed stretch denim made in vaguely 70s-ish swimwear shapes. She wasnt trying to reset anyones denim agenda here; this collection was more about proposing solutions for women who want to keep wearing the denim they already like when it gets really hot. Thats enough to make a market, not so much to make news.\"\n",

      "Lee has taken her collection away from its beginnings in rather structured tailoring in neutral colors toward something more fluid and airy, withsurprise!pops of color, bold stripes, and a few dappled black-and-white prints.

      "2016,Spring,J. Mendel,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"The J. Mendel customer has long been a certain type of Madison Avenue grande dame, one who comes for the furs from the incomparable atelier and sticks around for the romantic frocks to tuck under them. But the designers recent red carpet successes with a younger crowdTaylor Swift, Maria Sharapova, and the Sports Illustrated model Hannah Davis among themhave opened up a new demographic, one just as attuned to major red carpet moments as self-styled Instagram snaps. And who can blame Giles Mendel for wanting to be there for both?\n",
      "The day looks he had designed for Spring seemed crafted with this crew in mind, with urban-minded accents such as graphic prints, grommets, straps, and slits. Asymmetrical micro-pleated skirts were either made micro-length or cut to the ankle, paired with roomy tunics or boxy tees. In what felt like a more-is-more take on what the kids are wearing, bandeau tops were paired with snakeskin wrap skirts or light-as-air organza ballroom styles that, while masterfully renderedThe pleats open up and blossom like petals, said Mendel, and they didultimately missed the mark. (Skin may be in, and snakeskin, too, but the kids who love you for old-school romance wont necessarily love you for their going-out-clubbing looks.)\n",
      "As the glamour level rose, things loosened up. A narrow micro-pleated column dress with a built-in bandeau had massive appeal on and off the hanger, while a black-and-white abstract-print silk chiffon gown with cutout bodice was its own wind machine, moving with extreme graceit could be just the thing for next awards season. A creamy textured silk crepe anorak patterned with graphic black abstractions inspired by Japanese woodblock prints hit just the right note: charmingly sporty, even when paired with a matching intarsia cropped mink that Mendel explained was intended to disappear into the pattern when popped on top. And as for those furs, a pair of long, vividly patterned yagasuri intarsia mink vests For the plane? Mendel said with a winkwill prove just the thing to tide over the J. Mendel client, old and new, until fall, when the big coats come out.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,J.Crew,Chioma Nnadi,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"For a brand in times of transition, figuring out the best way to trigger the reset button is often the most pressing challenge. Thats perhaps why, this season, J.Crew was going back to its roots, or, as president and executive creative director Jenna Lyons put it, Pulling from the things that feel undeniably like us. Gingham, nautical stripes, tomboy favorites such as the shrunken military jacket: Its easy to distinguish the moving parts to the J.Crew look, one that Lyons herself has made so appealing to women the world over in the last decade.\n",
      "All those classics made an appearance in the presentation today, only often they were tweaked in subtle ways. One sun-bleached menswear-inspired plaid shirt was paired with a matching bias-cut skirt that was covered in glittering sequins, while another was recast as an off-the-shoulder peasant blousewhat is fast becoming the answer to the crisp white button-down. The brands knack for preppy print-on-print combos came through particularly well in a graphic blue-on-blue gingham shirt and pants ensemble. With new womenswear designer Somsack Sikhounmuong set to make his official debut next season, it will be interesting to see which way those familiar J.Crewisms will go.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,J.W.Anderson,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Gargantuan 80s leg-of-mutton sleeves. Galactic knitted pantsuits. Ruched body-con dresses. Keith HaringcumVivienne Westwood squiggle prints. Gold metal chokers. Square-toed metallic spike heels of the kind that havent been seen since the 90s. Lets put it this way: There is a lot to process at J.W.Anderson. A womans odyssey was what Jonathan Anderson was calling it backstage. The idea that if you took a date in time and sliced it through and looked at what everyone was doing at that timewould it mean anything? And would it matter if it didnt?\n",
      "But lets shelve the intellectual parsing of that complicated quote for a moment. Perhaps only Anderson knows what it means, and it doesnt matter if we never do. But to state it plainly from another angle, the thing about Anderson, at this very moment, is that he is someone possessed of the ability to jumble together unexpected ideas, and make a new sentence of them. It is the sentence that reads: You didnt know you wanted this beforebut now you will! That, of course, is the essence of fashionsomething that makes you feel a bit queasy and puzzled for a few seconds, but then, just as quickly shoots into the bloodstream as desire.\n",
      "Jonathan Anderson classifies as an experimental avant-garde designer in that sense, a leader. But at another just as crucial level, hes a clear-headed maker of product. Break down this collection, and its full of items to take away just as they are: many ribbed knits as tunics and pants, neat pantsuits in compact jersey, fluid printed midi skirts, a frill-fronted A-line dress, and a tracksuit covered in net. Then, bags, worn two at a time, cross-body, like panniers.\n",
      "But back to what the man said: A clue was in the audioa mix of Fran Lebowitzs words about Andy Warhol and his manipulation of fame, and Rihannas Only Girl (In the World). I was watching Martin Scorseses documentary about Fran Lebowitz and liked what she said, her commentary on a moment. She spoke about creativity. What does it mean? Maybe it only means something to me, said Anderson. Then he paused and shrugged, as if something Lebowitz said chimed with him on the level of being a designer in an industry that is constantly running at high speed and, of course, whose work is instantly exposed at every turn. Obviously, he said, Theres always another show. Not that he should worry about that today: This was a moment that is certain to keep people talkingand buying their Spring trophies for plenty of time to come.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jacquemus,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"A gigantic red ball of fabric was pushed across an open expanse of concrete floor by a tiny barefoot child in a mans white shirt. Models, walking in ones and twos, followed him, dressed in fractured tailored pieces, sliced half-jackets in navy and gray cloth dresses, overlaid and underlaid with white shirts cut on the diagonal or worn back-to-front and tied on with cotton tape. Halfway through the show, to add to the oddness, the designer himself appeared, seemingly an adult version of the boy, leading a white horse across the stage in an interlude before more models came on.\n",
      "What was this? A surreal symbolic dream or a fashion nightmare where clothes are to be bought in asymmetrical fractions? Backstage, Simon Porte Jacquemus, who recently won an LVMH Prize in its young designer competition, tried to explain the state of mind he was in when he plotted this oddly trancelike and unsettling parade. His emotions seemed raw and vulnerable. The collection was called Le Nez Rouge, he said, because he had been sick, afflicted with a red nose and personal troubles as he was designing. You know, my collections are normally about the South of France and the beach and happy things? Well, now the Jacquemus girl is not smiling, he said. Without spelling out what had happened, he added, My friends, my family knows.\n",
      "It is harsh to call judgment on a very young designer who is clearly under stressas are they allas he tries to make his way, with feeling, in the hard world of fashion commerce. Though his narrative, held in a huge arena of a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris, didnt quite hold up in the space, it didnt obfuscate everything Jacquemus has going for him. Backstage, his navy pants, long narrow skirts, and white shirts looked crisply cut and as attractive as they always do in stores.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jason Wu,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"With his recent turn toward tailoring and a more minimalist point of view, its easy to forget that Jason Wu got his start as a dressmaker. This season, he seemed eager to remind us of his origins. Glamour was the one-word description his show notes proffered. The first look out was a trenchcoat, sure, but its edges were softly frayed and its storm flap was ruffled. Ruffles were the big story. Cascading down the sides of a halter dress in a bright, blurry floral print and fluttering at the neckline of the shows best look, a gorgeous coral pink cocktail number, they evoked Yves Saint Laurent. Even a python-skin dress got the flounce treatment.\n",
      "Here and there on the shoulders of a blouse and the sides of a somewhat too-stiff woven raffia dress, those frills got the better of him. Hes no YSL (heck, probably not even Saint Laurent himself could live up to his legend now), but Wus output continues to mature. The work that went into the bodices of a camisole and a T-shirt dress, among other pieces, was so intricate it looked more like a print than a patchwork of five different kinds of lace. Otherwise, there was a healthy amount of the sportswear hes come to favor lately. Wu's tailoring is confident, and a pair of black suits with delicate lace underpinnings looked great with flat, strappy sandals. Also tempting: clingy knits in a mlange tweed for day, and, for evening, in fine-ribbed silk with more of that saucy fraying.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jean-Pierre Braganza,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"Jean-Pierre Braganza invited some serious toe-tapping this afternoon in London. The British-born Canadian designer spent his summer between the research rooms of the British Library and the blank canvas of his studio, listening to jazz greats from Charles Mingus to John Coltrane. But their freewheeling musical influence found its form not in the brightly-lit looks that made their way down the runway, but in Braganzas improvisational approach to designing them. I never liked jazz when I was growing up, he said backstage. But now, the fact that its so structured and yet so chaotic really fascinates me. That frenetic spirit translated into endless draping and deconstruction: Hems were left undone and suits were radically reconfigured with entire panels left to hang loose. This may all sound wildly experimental, but, in fact, these clothes will do nothing to alienate Braganzas eternal muse, that all-powerful female who, on this front row lineup, was embodied by the spiral-curled British songstress Ella Eyre.\n",
      "The show found its headiest form in digital print dresses that drew on the visual style of the Bauhaus. But, come next spring, the real standouts will be the series of white zip-skirted coats and crepe trench coats worn over diaphanous duchesse satin dresses. All were subtle, understated, and executed with a lighter-than-air finesse. As an aside, there was a message in the fact that Braganza had eschewed his usually extensive show notes this time around. You guys are going to hate me, he said with a smile to the gaggle of journalists waiting backstage. I want you to use your cerebral abilities to see the story for yourselves.  Well, perhaps because of the show's title, Whiplashed, which was taken from the Oscar-winning Miles Teller movie (tap, tap, tap), there's one word that immediately springs to mind: upbeat.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jenny Packham,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Click through Jenny Packhams past 10 or so collections and youll notice a common theme: Each one opened with an embellished dress. So when the first look at todays show was a black and red floral-printed suit, you had to wonder how Packham got there. When she rattled off a few of her favorite musicians backstageMick Jagger, Nick Cave, and David Bowieit all started to make sense. Packham was inspired by rock n roll legends who resisted gender strictures and werent afraid to indulge the more feminine aspects of their personalities. Packham herself was dressed in an oversize blazer, cropped pants, and creeper brogues: After decades in business, it was only a matter of time before she started taking a page from her own personal style.\n",
      "While the new emphasis on day-to-night dressing was promising, the androgynous concept didnt quite translate for many of the looks. The suits were a bit too boxy, and Packhams clientele relies on her for glitzy embellishments, not wildflower prints. Perhaps it was just muscle memory, but the glittering, red carpetworthy dresses were the ones that stood out. Consider Packhams most visible customer, Kate Middleton: Youd be hard-pressed to get her in a mannish blazer, but the jade georgette gown with draping at the hip would work perfectly.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jeremy Scott,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"This is your brain. This is your brain on screens. If Jeremy Scotts latest collection had a subtextand its not clear that it didit was that our brains are going a little screwy due to overexposure to screens. Check out the insane-looking cartoon faces on Scotts new intarsia knits: Isnt that kind of how your mind feels after several consecutive hours of binge-watching UnREAL while simultaneously answering emails on your laptop and glossing Instagram on your phone?\n",
      "Anyway. The screen thing was very much an ur-text of Scotts latest effort, with its digital television prints and trippy sweaters knit to look the way old television screens did when they went a little wonky. That was all part of Scotts larger theme, which was an homage to sixties era B-movies and sci-fi that he interpreted with his typical heaping of club-kid flash. The eras tropes were rehearsed in everything from abbreviated A-line silhouettes to ray-gun prints to the paillette mesh that was an overt tip-of-the-hat to Cardin. As usual, Scott seemed to be having more fun making fashion than anyone else on the scene these days, but the lineups buoyant tone didnt disguise the fact that this was a pretty disciplined collection. The mens looks were eye-popping, but they hewed to classic shapesguys with some daring in the fashion department might be swayed by a button down in Scotts scribble print, or a leather biker spotted with white polka dots. Lots of the womens looks, meanwhile, could appeal to customers outside the Jeremy cult, to wit, the tulle pieces with high-contrast sequin stripes, or summery short sheaths covered in the scribble or raygun prints. A cocktail dress, black on top, with a ribbon at the waist and a bouffant pink and silver brocade skirt, was downright homecoming queen mainstream.\n",
      "Scotts rigor was also demonstrated in his materials and his technique. The paillettes on the opening look worn by Gigi Hadid, for instance, were bordered by seed pearl embroidery. And Scotts deftness with textiles was witnessed best in the very simplest of his ensembles, a matching cropped sweater and miniskirt set down in a cool spongy knit. Nothing looked tossed-off here, in other words, just as nothing looked really, truly nuts. Scotts experience at Moschino seems to have convinced him theres some fun to be had, too, in selling tons of clothes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ji Oh,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Shes not too pretty, but dressed well. That was Ji Ohs summation of her Spring woman, who had a kind of haphazard, jolie laide, and faintly aggressive quality. The designers muse was tough, and her presentation backdrop was a construction sitelike mishmash of signage. Despite the streetwise jumping-off point, the clothes bore all the hallmarks of Ohs signature pared-back polish. Basics with a twist are the labels bread and butter (landing the line in doors like Barneys, Harvey Nichols, and Intermix), and this season offered them up in spades. There were pinstriped jumpsuits and a plunging silk slip dress; a cropped, cowl-neck sweatshirt; and easy wide-leg trousers. Change is incremental in Ohs world of modern staples: This season an eye for utilitarian hardware (snaps and zippers and buttons, oh my!) and a somber palette grounded in navy and white lent things a more androgynous edge, in contrast to the punched-up reds, cobalt, and metallic silver of seasons gone by.\n",
      "The real news here was denim. It was the first time Oh had taken on the textile, and she whipped a single wash into contrasting patch-pocket jackets (using the reverse), pull-on trousers, skinny jeans, and more. Dressed well, indeed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jil Sander Navy,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Its no secret that Jil Sander Navy knows its way around a clean pattern. But this season the labels variations on layering added a kick of cool to what could otherwise have been a buy-it-anywhere basic. Silhouettes were enhanced by skirts and shirts with peplums (not the teeny-bopping, out-to-brunch kind, but rather, smarterwith texture) that mushroomed out from under button-ups to create volume and a cinched waist. There were also puffed ruffles, which made for a pepped-up take on sleeves, and pointed hems on skirts that resembled a mans waistcoat.\n",
      "References to Henri Matisses cutouts came in jagged floral patterns that covered shirt and tank dresses in blue and white, as well as in hot pink and citrus orange. In a nod to Piet Mondrian, a perforated shirt and tank dress were tiered into green, yellow, and blue primary colorsa well-suited complement to the classic linear silhouettes. But it was the riff on athleticwear that turned basics into must-haves: Dresses were reminiscent of deconstructed parkas, fastened with horizontal elastic cording that cleverly created curves. A white skirt in the same outerwear style had a strip of fabric that acted like a belt, creating an unfinished empire waist that elegantly tufted out above the hipsa piece that could easily become a closet staple or a street style standout.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jil Sander,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Disciplined. Rigorous. Precise. Google Jil Sander and those three adjectives come up more than any others. Fashion, at this moment, is moving in a different direction; Spring is looking decidedly deshabille. Whats Rodolfo Paglialunga, installed at Jil Sander one year ago, to do? Remain faithful to the house codes, even as memories of the founder grow fuzzy? Go with the current flow? Its a conundrum that all designers charged with heading up old labels must face. After a couple runway shows that hewed to Sanders clean lines, Paglialunga tried option two. \n",
      "An otherwise straightforward two-button blazer was sliced at the shoulder seams, another jacket was cut away in the back, and a third was deconstructed to look more like a pinafore than your standard double-breasted fare, but the tailoring wasnt so radical as to be alienating. The Sander-classic crisp white shirt got a revamp, too, in crinkly, slinky sky blue silk with an au courant cutout at the midriff. Rounding things out were the sort of slip dresses and wispy bits of silk that have been multiplying on other runways this season. Straps spilled off shoulders, and asymmetric necklines dipped to reveal the upper arm. Cutouts proliferated, not just at the waist, but near the hem of a sheath, or sliced vertically front and back on looser-fitting dresses. Paglialunga is a talented guy, but this collection gave you a twinge of the familiar. It made you miss Sanders hard edges a bit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jill Stuart,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Jill Stuart designs wearable, hyper-feminine clothes with a woman in mind, rather than a particular reference point. From the first look, it was clear Spring was all about an exuberant, hip-shaking party girl. There were yards of flowing satin, from a languid slip to the designers new take on the voluminous, high-neck blouse thats still trending right now. It was easy to envision Studio 54 when a pair of superwide flares hit the runway, but Stuart wasnt really that focused on the past. I think this is just how girls are dressing today, she explained backstage. She used adjectives like vibrant, dancy, and magneticthe same words you could use to describe Solange Knowles, who was sitting in the front row.\n",
      "Stuarts following is a loyal one, so the suede skirts and tiered floral gowns will no doubt generate long wish lists. But a few of the pieces wont be as easy to pull off, like high-rise satin culottes that spotlight your hips or a truly miniature ruffled bandeau. The best looks emphasized texture, but would still flatter a wide range of women, like a shimmery, ankle-length floral dress with a cropped sweater layered on top.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,John Galliano,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Bill Gaytten indulged in some Anglophilia at his John Galliano show this evening. His was a gloss on the contradictions of British 20th-century style, rather than a straightforward homage to any particular erathere was, for instance, a hint of a country gentleman out for a shooting weekend in Gayttens checked tailoring, and meanwhile more than a hint of the punks who sneered at such men in his looks embellished with safety pins and studs. \n",
      "Rave-era anoraks and dress-for-dinner frock-coats also got a look-in on the Galliano runway. But the standouts in this collection were indubitably Gayttens frothy dresses. These came in various romantic, barely there versions, some bedazzled in sequins, others paneled in lace, and still more boasting tiers of demure ruffles. The most eye-catching, though, were Gayttens polka-dot numbersthe graphic black-on-white pattern made for a nice counterpoint to the looks diaphanous cuts. They seemed well suited to some modern-day Lady Mary, of Downton famealthough, the Lady Marys of today would likely be inclined to throw Gayttens spongy dun-color parka on over that dress before heading out for the evening. British style is nothing if not eclectic. Gaytten captured that quality well.\"\n",

As the great divide between high fashion and real women remains very present, collections like Joie are becoming more relevant than ever, thanks to their ability to tap into the little comfortable luxuries that women of all ages want to wear, without the forage of vintage shopping nor the conceptual trappings that can often plague runway brands.\n",
      "Its the little details that set us apart, continues Wilder-Hill, explaining the floral print on a braided silk slip dress. This motif came from a scrap of wallpaper I found at a Paris flea market and had repainted by our incredible in-house artist. While Joie began as a jeans brand in 2001, its evident that denim has taken a backseat to the expansive range of sundresses, floaty shirting, and peasant blouses that emphasize soft cotton fabrications for Springas gauzy voiles, topstitched embroideries, and broderie anglaise details instill a sense of decorative nostalgia in the dolman-sleeve silhouettes cinched with drawstrings, and skinny plaited belts. Some of the prettiest looks within the Spring lineup feature inserts of Victorian-inspired lacework, their delicacy balanced by stonewashed denim or light suede, keeping their historical leanings within Joies contemporary, feminine frame.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jonathan Saunders,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"In a light-drenched tent at noon on a sunny Sunday, Jonathan Saunders set out to show his audience his true colorsas a designer of effortless, breezy, sensuous clothes. Most of the collection was spun out of the success hes had with a certain bias-cut slip-dress design of a few seasons agoits paneled structure lends itself ideally to color-blocking and to matching and clashing prints that can be continually switched up. So, yes, there was a lot of that in his Spring show, but he also noted that it was the attitude of the bias cut he was trying to transmit by using trailing ribbon ties and shapes like wrap-over blouses and bathrobe coats.\n",
      "Essentially, of course, Saunders is a colorist and print and pattern specialist of long standing in London, and having acquired a new investor, this showwith its expensively purpose-built venuerepresents a turn of the page on the business front. He has acquired a new CEO and employees, which he says is freeing him up to concentrate on being creative and on the detail of luxury finishings on the inside of his clothes. Thats all good news for his following of grown-up women in the business, political, art, and fashion worlds.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Jonathan Simkhai,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"I think that women come to me when they want to get dressed up and feel strong, said Jonathan Simkhai before his Spring 2016 show: This collection proved that they could feel romantic, too. Technical lace, embroidered macram, and bonded burnout were rendered into figure-hugging cocktail frocks inspired by the tropes city-dwellers overlook every dayskyscrapers, subway grates, and scaffolding. But it wasnt purely urban-minded. The designer had spent several weeks this summer in Lake Como researching fabrics and developing a taste for country life, as evidenced most winningly by the loosened-up cotton voile dress worn with low-top white sneakers (and, less convincingly, in a pair of embroidered basketball shorts). I think its one of those grass-is-greener things, said Simkhai, referring to the seasonal exodus of Manhattanites who repair to various country escapes during the warmer months. Youre here and you want to be there, or youre there and want to be here. His idea seemed to be that with enough flounce and a little wiggle room (the type not necessarily encouraged by an embroidered macram trumpet skirt), one can manage both.\n",
      "Simkhai, a 2015 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist, has developed a following for his figure-skimming silhouettes among those who vote with their Instagram likesbright, young, and often photographed things like DJ Mia Moretti, who provided the shows soundtrack, and model Devon Windsor, who sat front row in something lacy, black, and body-con. And happily for Simkhai, thats the thing about bright young things: They always need more party dresses.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Joseph,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"It's become a bit cliched to talk about masculine/feminine now: Everyone's talking about it, observed an endorphin-pumped Louise Trotter after this interesting overload of a show. I wanted to play more with the role models of a male and a female, she said. Almost uniquely, this is a subject upon which fashion can be more explicit than words, for clothes are our most potent codifiers of gender.\n",
      "But lets try and keep up. We started with classically-for-Joseph neutral menswear-touched womenswear: Monochrome T-shirts, skirts, and sweats both held together and defined by twist and turn. There were plenty of unexpected rips and twists, whorls of construction. There were bengal stripe versus pencil stripe viscose silk shirtdresses and skirts, plus the odd drop of conventional feminized suiting teamed with sheer tailored mens shirts with girlishly ribboned cuffs. Then a shot of acid yellow and patent shine black leather signaled what Trotter saw as a break phase in the narrative from girl dressed as boy toand please bear with me heregirl dressed as boy dressed like girl.\n",
      "This allowed Trotter to blend pretty, gleaming vintage brocades into monkish, military-touched pieces trailed by nylon webbingthis second movements equivalent to the knots and bows wed just seen in the first. Her expression of this mood became less gilded and more repressedyou know, manlyuntil a last look that took us back, near full-circle, to the first. To see some of the still-shifting ground Trotter was attempting to survey here, see the Fall collections from Gucci or Craig Green. As an overviewand a point of viewthis Joseph collection was both dizzying and fascinating.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Josie Natori,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"For Fall, Josie Natori mined Istanbul for inspiration. For Spring, she trained her eye a little farther east. The whole collection is inspired by Asian painting, said the designer at todays presentationher first eveningwear-only outing.\n",
      "Natori said she was fascinated by calligraphy, and wanted to experiment with brushstrokes. To that end, an asymmetrical dress featured a straightforward black-and-white brushstroke, but Natori also used crystal embellishments to create the same effect on a white column dress and a black basket-weave gown (one of the strongest looks). You really cant go wrong with black and white, she remarked, dressed in a chic black shift dress.\n",
      "But color wasnt off the table entirely. The designer honored the season by playing with vibrant, slightly off-kilter color combinations. An expertly tailored fuchsia strapless tunic layered over orange stovepipe pants was a memorable look. Some of the kimono-inspired ensembles verged on being too literal, but Natori hit her stride when she incorporated elements of the traditional garb in subtler ways, as in the case of a pea green raw silk strapless number with an embellished obi-inspired neckline. That, said Natori, almost shyly, is one of my favorites.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Juan Carlos Obando,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Fashion shows, with all of their required hustle and flow, can actually prove to be something of an obstacle for smaller design houses, as the average Fashion Week affair has become more like a performance piece (or a gesture of how much money a given brand has the ability to shell out) and less about its actual purpose, which is, you know, to show the clothes. Environmental worries (seating charts! The music! The lights! The lack of heat! The oppressive heat! The location!) are the immediate concerns, and the details of a given collection often get lost in the shuffle. So when it came to his Spring 2016 show, Juan Carlos Obando wasnt taking any chances. I want you to turn this jacket inside out, he said at one of many private appointments he is holding today in a small space near Saint-Germain, proffering a cropped waxed organza version with generous bell sleeves. Look at what weve done!\n",
      "The piece felt as smooth and as light as cotton, and yes, the details (stitches, seams, lines) were perfect. This perfection is a sticking point with Obando, who has leaned hard into the technical aspects of his manufacturing this season: Hes employed exclusive Italian mills; hes hired more hands on deck to supervise the construction. Count the stitches! I am so proud of these details, he said, highlighting the bias-cut trim of a silk tank top, the corners at the edge of a scarf tie. I never want to be a brand that looks or feels cheap. I hear enough from my friends about how clothes look one way on Instagram, and then entirely another in a store. And as Obando has realized, the chasm between an Instagram like and an actual purchase lies in the physical here and now: How does it feel, how does it look, and, most important, is it worth it?\n",
      "Obando launched with Neiman Marcus and Net-a-Porter last season, and a plethora of trunk shows has made him increasingly aware of what women want: less gowns, more separates. Things that can be worn to work and then adjusted (either by adding a skirt or a heel) for evening engagements. Comfort, a sense of romance, a hint at a vibrant inner life. Its not about an impossible, inspirational womanits about how the clothes make them feel, he said, in what has become a bit of a refrain among designers this season. These were elegant, easy looks based around decadently heavy silk separates (those Italian mills!), like a camisole with a tie-waist and furls of fabric below the shoulders (the addition of a skirt slit on the bias turns it red-carpet-ready), a slip dress that loops and ties around the wrists, striped fishermans pants (those perfect seams again!). Deceptively simple pieces were worked with subtle details: shirtdresses with scarf-tied necklines that trail behind you as you walk, a column skirt slit in the front and back to move like trousers, with the stitching (the yarn the same as those used in baseballs, the designers nod to a recent trip to Cuba) picked out. Its about courtship, Obando said. Im obsessed with courtshipthe whole thing, my designs, seeing them on a hanger in the store, trying it on, I am courting the women, trying to convince them to fall in love. Judging by these clothes, hes going to have a very full dance card come spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Juicy Couture,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Its probably been a while since youve wornor thought aboutJuicy Couture. But after years of bad news for the brand, a glimpse at its Spring collection reveals that business is boomingjust probably not where you live. There arent any Juicy stores left in the United States, but China has nearly 100. Los Angeles and Dallas are important cities for Juicy, too, but its clear that the real money is way east.\n",
      "As such, it was admittedly difficult to parse the sprawling Spring lineup, since it was designed with a different market in mind. The collection was separated into several delivery groups, each one driven by an of-the-moment trend. There were boho florals, a longtime Juicy signature, as well as graphic, 80s-inspired logo tees, and neon tweed jackets, which felt vaguely reminiscent of Jeremy Scotts recent collections for Moschino. Here in New York, designers have been embracing a more natural, crafty approach to dressing, but Juicy was all about the opposite: bright colors, short hemlines, and graphic prints. Still, there were a few straightforward, well-constructed pieces that would fit into even the most edited wardrobes, like the crisp ponte jackets, high-rise flared jeans, and foulard-print pants, which read like elevated pajamas. As for Juicys infamous velour track suits, theyre still aroundthey even inspired Juicy Sport, a brand-new, equally colorful new label of athletic wear.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Julien David,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"This was the 10th Paris womenswear show in the cutely unique Julien David narrative: His is a label conceived in France but entirely manufactured in Japan, where he lived for a decade. Seven years after launching, he has 100 stockists and says that 40 percent of his sales hail from the country in which his clothes are made.\n",
      "So it seemed right and proper that todays collection was a gentle exploration of the similarities and differences between his two home nations. The differences were articulated most clearly in his contrasting  use of sunflower and cherry blossom prints or workwear-lean jackets and carpenter coats and pants. The panniers on asymmetrical-pleat skirts could have been sourced from Marie Antoinettes wedding dress or Diors Bar suit and servedif you stretched it a bitto produce a Gallic version of the ornamental exaggeration ohashori.\n",
      "There was plenty of denimin dungaree dresses, more carpenter coats, topstitched jeans, and appealingly curve-leg, four-button pants. Nmes, France, is where legend has it this most ubiquitous cotton twill originated, and despite the role of North American teenage culture in ubiquitizing denim, it is (arguably) Japan where some of todays finest quality is milled. Davids is from Okayama.\n",
      "Vinyl laminated over embroidery on elastic-cinched, flute-hipped T-shirts, fleur-de-lis fil coupes, undone Brigitte Bardot bustiers as outerwear, and resin-backed cotton crop tops were among the further passing pleasures here. The soundtrack was a willfully strange collision of Needle in the Hay and Brush Your Teeth, while the mustachioed gentleman on a silk jacquard romper worn beneath a full black skirt and bustier was Henri, the designers grandfather. This was Jean de Florette meets Swept Away, marinated in Davids personal preoccupations. Together these ingredients made for an interesting and quietly progressive pot-au-feu. Or nikujaga.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Julien Macdonald,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"There were whoops and cheers even before the crowd caught sight of the first look at todays Julien Macdonald show, held at the centuries-old Smithfield Market. In a fashion world where trends rotate on an ever faster axis, theres something comforting about a designer who holds fast to familiar terraineven when thats as revealing as the spangly, flapper-age dress that opened proceedings. Though you wouldnt have guessed it until a ways through this mammoth 52-look collection, this past summer Macdonald traded the club podiums of the Balearic Isles for the black-sanded beaches of Bali. I properly chilled out for the first time in my life, he said post-show. There was so much inspiration to be found in the tranquility and raw natural beautyand all the traditional textiles. \n",
      "When Macdonald started sketching out Spring 2016, it was these Balinese batiks that he drew on. They provided the collections biggest moment: the designers main-line menswear debut. Tropical prints showed up on beach-y tunic tops and silk shorts that Macdonald says he has been trying to get around to creating for the past 20 years. But I didnt want to just do camp menswear, he said, counting Puff Daddy and Kanye West amongst those whod have a taste for this kind of directional dressing. Yet, Macdonald being Macdonald, he couldnt resist adding sparkles even here. Forget the finale gowns and the intricately woven web knits that remained his mainstayin the mind of this Welshman, its always going to be all about the rhinestones, even for the boys.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Junya Watanabe,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Junya Watanabe set his show in the National Museum of Immigration History in Paris, an immense Art Deco place, built to celebrate the cultural benefits of French colonialism, when that sort of thing was thought to accrue to the glory of the republic. On the way in, guests passed a piece of contemporary art which gave some people pause: a wooden boat, filled to heaving point with bundles wrapped in African fabric. It took but a small leap to associate that with another scene at Dismaland, where Banksy's boats filled with miniature models of immigrants floated on a disused Weston-super-Mare holiday pond. \n",
      "An uncomfortable choice of surroundings, then, for Watanabe to show us a collection themed around African fabric patterns, on a cast of white models whose faces were decorated with pale fleshcolor globules, mimicking tribal scarification marks. It was hard to know which way to react. Watanabe is as known for his quiet pacifism and his silent rebellious streak as he is for never giving explanatory quotes. Was it a commentary on fashion's long record of annexing the dress, art, and religious artifacts of other peoples? Should he be criticized for doing that? And how does he view that from Tokyo, living in a country whose culture is constantly appropriated by Western fashion (as seen only this week in John Galliano's geisha-themed show)?\n",
      "Anyway: There was no denying the anxiety of watching Watanabe's show through the prism of all these contextual and moral questions. A pity, because at the beginning, there was a clear view to beautiful, loose smocks and shirtdresses, some with draped belled sleeves, and semi-sheer fabrics, some of which involved black matte lace constructed in a pattern which merged a sense of camouflage with animal pattern. After that came two looks with a knitted tiger amid leopard pelts thrown over the shoulders as wraps; also great. No doubt the African wax-print looks, which followed, will be prove as easy and commercial summerwear in stores; but at the same time, they will leave some feeling uneasy.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Kaelen,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"When presented with the opportunity from the WCFDA (an initiative from the CFDA and W Hotels) to take a research trip, rather than going abroad, Kaelen Haworth struck out on an all-American road trip. Stopping in New Orleans, as well as Austin, Marfa, and Dallas, Texas, the designer was struck by the various landscapes, particularly the harshness and graphic appeal of the desert. And so came a collection sparer and more sophisticated than some of seasons gone by. Shapes skewed toward a certain utility, even at the dressiest: A floor-skimming T-shirt dress was boxy and came with patch pockets, though its generous slit and fantastic chartreuse hue added plenty in the way of appeal. Likewise, the versatility of a sleeveless jumpsuit in elephant-gray suede didnt need to be explainedit fairly cried out to be teamed with your everyday kicks, or sky-high wedges and a clutch. Haworth continued last seasons explorations with knitwear, and while you wont find much in the way of the slouchy or the oversize, her clingy ribbed knits are top-notch.\n",
      "The sparseness of these pieces was a promising development for the label; still, it wasnt all minimalism and no play. Shimmering silver linen culottes and a cowl-back metallic rose gold slip nodded to the labels more feminine proclivities of the past in a soign new way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Karen Walker,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Karen Walker has a thing for the esoteric. Last season she was inspired by obscure British sci-fi series Sapphire and Steel, and this season it was a remote town in Russia that provided her jumping-off pointand the only link between the two is that youve probably never heard of either.\n",
      "Backstage before her show, Walker explained her inspiration: We came across these photos, taken in the 80s, of this unmarked town just north of Moscow called Star City, that was a secret military training base for the Soviet Unions space program. And there were all these photos of these funny, folksy, chintzy Russian sitting rooms but with space suits and space gloves. Walker, always a fan of intriguing juxtapositions, said she wanted to contrast the folksy, domestic, and ordinary with high-tech, cutting-edge utility. And, she continued, a shot of glam. Because it was quite an elite, glamorous city. It was difficult to make heads or tails of the idea.\n",
      "But then the show started. If Walker is a little bonkers for using such bizarre, obscure reference points, there is certainly a method to her madness: She was able to suffuse elements of her inspiration into an utterly wearable collection. A small detail like an extended exposed zipper on high-waisted pants recalled the training jumpsuits astronauts might wear, without hitting the viewer over the head with the revelation. You wouldnt think that space suits and peasant blouses go together, but Walker somehow made it work: Supple gold leather pieces (a nod to the Mercury space suit) were styled with Edwardian blouses and ribbed sweaters (and sometimes topped with a jaunty necktie).\n",
      "There was an 80s vibe to the whole collection, which exerted itself most boldly in the acid-washed denim pieces. Walker also ingeniously added a horizontal zipper to two floaty white dresses, allowing the wearer to zip off the bottom and create a shorter dress or top. It proved that utility neednt be slick or complicated to be effective.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Kate Spade New York,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Outside the Kate Spade New York presentation, a balmy scent of flowers seemed to douse the surrounding sidewalks: Chief creative officer Deborah Lloyd had partnered with the floral company FTD, placing almost 30,000 flowers in the space. After a harsh winter, when that first day of spring breaks, how relieved we all are to buy our first flowers at the bodega, she said of the inspiration. And that feeling was evident in the clothes: Flowers were everywhere, mostly in patterns. There were florets in grayscale shades splattered onto an A-line skirt, and in abstract black and white on a shift dress; delicate daisies dotted a slouchy jumpsuit. \n",
      "But it was the more pared-back use of floral printsand springtime colorsthat hit home. The subtle outline of blossoms was charmingly laser-cut onto the hem and neckline of a daffodil yellow fit-and-flare frock, and the same pattern was smartly infused into a polished skirt set. Reminiscent of a stylish stroll to the corner store, there was a charming white sequin shift dress, striped in candied tones of pastel rose, sunflower, royal blue, and apricot. But the real winner? A black strapless cocktail dress covered in petal appliqus was the freshest and most perennial piece.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Katie Ermilio,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Katie Ermilios designs have quickly become staples of the red carpet, trotted out by celebrities like Jessica Alba, Taylor Swift, and Selena Gomez. With the designer's Spring collection, which emphasized curve-skimming silhouettes and self-created luxe fabrics, it was obvious that her focus hasnt wavered from occasion-dressing. Taking tennis as a theme, Ermilio translated the aerial views of center court into sleek strapless gowns, empire-waist jumpsuits, and fitted double-faced silk skirts, converting the fresh palette of the racquet grounds into a smooth color wheel of Pepto pinks and sage greens. \n",
      "Ermilios use of linear patterns smartly complemented her body-hugging fits. A pinstripe duchesse dress mirrored the grids on the court, while the tonal checks in emerald gave a high-waisted trumpet skirt less of a froufrou effect and more structure. But Ermilio also put a pointed spin on her eveningwear specialty by creating separates that could easily become elevated daytime pieces. For example, there was pair of Betty Drapertype, pink checked high-waisted trousers that could just as easily be worn with a classic white tee or Ermilios matching crop top in four-ply silk. Not just for cocktail hour, the designer seemed to say, and we couldnt agree more.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Katie Gallagher,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"A collection titled Chinatown might conjure up images of girls in silk qipao dresses and embroidered pajamas. But the New York City neighborhoods mash-up of Chinese traditions, crowded streets, and diverse residents has been a constant source of inspiration for Katie Gallagher throughout her career. The designer has lived and worked in the area for nearly a decade, and for Spring she translated its singular energy into clothes that were easy, minimal, and just a touch charming. Its really just about my take on Chinatown, and what I smell, feel, and see when Im there, Gallagher said. That came through in the color palette, which was predominantly black and white with pops of red and goldlike Chinese gold, or a taxibut it was also felt in the delicate textures. Still, the stone-washed silk slip dresses would no doubt stand up to the Mott Street hustle; some of them had a vaguely Eastern influence with apron necklines. Gallagher also whipped up a slouchy cherry red tote as a nod to the plastic shopping bags you pick up at Chinatown markets. That tongue-in-cheek accessory lent a softer, more playful element to the collection: It felt fresh for Gallagher, whose oeuvre is characteristically more edgy and conceptual.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Kenzo,Chioma Nnadi,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon love a far-flung, unexpected destination for their Kenzo shows. Those who made it out to the Nineteenth Arrondissement this morning, though, were transported to a different milieu in more ways than one: Gigantic white arches were stacked on the runway, and painted with the shades of pink and peach that recalled the sun-washed architecture of Mediterranean towns, such as Portofino in Italy.  \n",
      "Kenzo is a brand that's global and nomadic at its core, so having endless summer vacation vibes built into the set was a nice touch. And with their new collection, the New York duo addressed how a well-traveled, modern woman can put some of that feeling into her everyday wardrobe. The word swimtimates will sound unfamiliar to some, but essentially it takes the traditional idea of a bathing suit into your lingerie drawer, an approach to summer dressing that cool young things on the festival circuit will understand. There were compelling renditions on the runway that were worth flaunting: knit, geometric pieces that peeked from under spaghetti utilitarian minidresses and updates on the 90s bodysuits that were paired with printed miniskirts. \n",
      "The fanny pack, that other 90s favorite, got a makeover too, and the best example was fashioned military style, with three small pouches on a waist-cinching belt. Lim and Leon have a knack for making practical and Instagrammable accessories like this, though the ornate chandelier earrings and bold necklaces were a little misplaced within the sporty, graphic context of the collection. The sensible, ankle-strap gladiator sandals that came with spiky reflexology footbeds put the skin-baring, printed looks on a fresh footing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,KLS Kimora Lee Simmons,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"The last time Kimora Lee Simmons formally presented her KLS collection, it was back in December, when her label made its debut. In the meantime, Simmons has been busyshe gave birth to a son and opened up the KLS Kimora Lee Simmons flagship in Beverly Hills, in a jewel-box space, as Simmons described it today.\n",
      "The new KLS collection also demonstrated that Simmons has spent the intervening months evolving her labels point of view, if only slightly. There was the same emphasis on graphic pencil dresses, executed in flattering ponte blends, and a similar smattering of sporty pieces, like a pair of slouchy trousers with a track-pant stripe down each leg. But Simmons included a broader range of silhouettes this time aroundfull skirts and minis, Grecian-draped dresses and gowns, boxy blazers, and a fairly broad array of trouser shapes. The best of the latter was the mannish pair of slacks done in a slightly shiny pinstripe, which the designer showed with a matching halter-neck vest. It was a sexy, feminine take on a classic menswear look. Another new development here was Simmonss expanded range of separates, of which the standouts were her crisp shirts with sheer panels and leather biker jackets with sleeves that zipped off to three-quarter-length. All in all, the collection felt more rounded than the debut, and it had a lot more spark. Onward and upward.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Koch,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 29, 2015\",\"For the runway debut of her year-old label, Koch, Christelle Kocher turned the lower concourse of Les Halles into her venue and set the showtime for 9:00 p.m. With all the mall shops closed and commuters dispersedand with no actual runway save for the orderly clustering of gueststhe cavernous, brutalist space gave many clues to her brand positioning. Kocher pointed out how the show space was non-elitist yet in the heart of Paris; within five minutes of the Louvre yet adjacent to the citys busiest public transport station; accessible yet unpredictable. Her casting ranged from Soo Joo Park and Charlotte Free to a girl handpicked off the street to her neighbor in the 20th arrondissement.\n",
      "But even without a single auxiliary aid, the clothes broadcast how the intersection of couture detailing and streetwear styling could lead to a kinetic, distinctively contemporary collection. Kocher also serves as the artistic director for Maison Lemari, one of the specialist ateliers (in this case, feathers) owned by Chanel subsidiary Paraffection. Embroideries undertaken by sister ateliers Montex and Lesage embellished sports bras, basketball shorts, T-shirts, and parkas, showing how craftsmanship remains a designers ultimate power play. The tank bedecked in feathers and bling, the tracksuit encrusted with tulle, and the bodysuit paved in iridescent paillettesif these pieces arent destined for performers known by their acronym aliases (M.I.A. and FKA twigs, were looking at you), then they demand personalities with comparable moxie. Still, its too early to tell whether Kocher is trying to degrade flashy or elevate trashy. Likely both. At least that was the impression made by the earrings and rings she created with Goossens, the couture jewelry atelier. They spread across fingers and crawled up ears like mangled marvels.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Kolor,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Junichi Abe launched Kolor more than a decade ago as a mens line, one aimed at a certain type of stylish man, the kind for whom a sweatshirt is never just a sweatshirt, and whose sneaker selection is not necessarily a reflection of his athleticism. Abes comparatively fledgling womens collection, now in its second official season, has a markedly similar aesthetic in mind: military touches on parkas and vest pockets, narrow-cut cotton trousers topped with netted tulle, and of course, sweatshirts, though here they boast jersey backs or pleated tulle trimmings, along with the occasional frilled, high collarVictoriana meets Champion. Abe develops all of his textiles himself, and they are unique to the house, so what might feel de rigeurhammered silver and gold lace, metallic-stamped organzaupon close inspection is subtly spectacular, the lace here pleated, miraculously, to show its shiny underside. Layered oversize polka-dot T-shirts were worn loose off the body and over houndstooth printed shorts, an exploration of what a brand representative (Abe was not present at the presentation) called where good taste meets bad taste. Ballooning skirts appeared to be made of parachutes, if parachutes were also made of tutus. Abe has never been afraid of a little color, and bold stripes reigned supreme, with flashes of fluorescent tones put to good use on trims, like that of a standout bomber jacket, slim and olive and just the type of layering piece any person needs in their wardrobe for an unpredictable spring.\n",
      "Shoes, a new undertaking for the designer, came in three styles: a thick, ridge-soled kitten-heel pump, a platform brogue, and a platform sandal inspired by one from the men's collection, the top rendered in richly earth-toned suede. The aim of this collection, an aide explained, is in step with much of this season: not to dress some impossible woman, but rather, real women, specifically, the Kolor Man's girlfriend. At least they're in good company.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,KTZ,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"KTZ designer Marjan Pejoski and partner Sasko Bezovski decamped to New York Fashion Week last season, saying at the time that they werent sure where theyd be unveiling future collections because they liked the idea of going where the spirit moved them. As it turned out, they wound up back in London this season, and it seems that Pejoski was seeing his hometown with fresh eyes. If theres one inescapable sight in London these days, its the construction site: This town is evolving at speed. The new KTZ collection seized on both the imagery of the construction site and its augury of a remapped cityscape; signs at the club space where the KTZ show was held tonight blinked the phrase The World to Come.\n",
      "These clothes had a very different tone from the ones shown by KTZ in recent seasons. The labels signature club kid vibe remained in place, but Pejoski cashed in the nomadic vibe of previous collections and conjured a gritty urban feeling in its place. Out with the tribal motifs and heavy mirror embroidery, in with chain-link patterns, paint spatter, and wordy patches redolent of pasted-up flyers. This seasons most intriguing evolution, meanwhile, was found in the tailored looks, like a sculptural trench coat made out of a fabric that resembled a crumpled brown paper bag. The suggestion was made explicit by Pejoskis fluttering handle embellishments, which he also used on looks in black leather.\n",
      "There was a menacing quality to this collection. Nothing too overt, though there was a gothic note to some of the looks. What read as dark was Pejoskis way of spotlighting the visual elements of the city we generally try not to seethe blur of litter and temporary fencing around the lots where shiny skyscrapers are going up. You got the feeling that the club kids who comprise the cult of KTZ number among the things unseen that will be swept away when the new city emerges. Pejoski proffered the optimistic The World to Come tonight. He might equally well have opted for The Last Rave.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lacoste,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"The French sportswear label founded almost a century ago by tennis champ Ren Lacoste had the good sense in 2010 to install Felipe Oliveira Baptista at the creative helm. If they were looking to jazz up the brand with youthful verve and crisp urbanism, for which the Portuguese designer was then becoming known, thats exactly what they got. Which is to say, at the mens and womens Spring collection today, tellingly few polo shirts could be spotted, and there was little croc insignia.\n",
      "We may see some Olympic inspiration as the rest of the collections play out, but not every brand can lay claim to it the way Lacoste can. The label will once again dress the French Olympic delegation as the athletes in Rio make their way around the opening ceremony next year. And there is a historical link: Lacoste himself was an Olympic medalist back in 1924.\n",
      "Thats how Baptista arrived at the theme of flags for Spring, channeling the victorious moment an Olympian is draped in his or her countrys flag upon winning gold. He abstracted, fragmented, and recombined any number of national bannersFrench, Swiss, Japanese, Americanany number of ways, across shirts, tanks, shorts, jackets (often tied around the waist), ponchos, and otherwise simple suits. Against that kind of kaleidoscope, an all-silver jumpsuitalluding to those shiny blankets athletes wear for warmthstood out all the more. The closing looks, with their jumble of stars and stripes all jostling for attention, couldnt have made a more provocative statement without crossing over into trite rainbow territory. Ultimately, said Baptista, its about peace and diversity.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lanvin,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"And, bringing the heart, soul, and attitude back to Paris fashion, please welcome . . . Mr. Alber Elbaz!\n",
      "Theres a little bit of a fightback against one-note, compliantly market-obedient fashion going on at the moment, and how nice it was to see Alber Elbaz putting Lanvin out there on the front line tonight. He staged his Spring collection literally as theater, placing the Lanvin name up in glittering lights at one end of the runway and sending out a show he said was a manifesto.\n",
      "More on Elbazs underlying thoughts later. In the moment, it was the fast pace of his girls and their almost fierce range of character that turned this into a hit Lanvin variety performance. The show moved swiftly through acts. First, black and white daywearpants and blouses with balloon sleeves or rippling flounces were followed by chic-simple silk dresses and sculptural cocktail numbers. Parodies of body-exposing draped jersey red carpet gowns, underpinned with nude corsetry, gave way to madly glittery party things with a wacky finaleof busy Lanvin souvenir prints featuring patterns of shoes and bags, and funny graffitied handbags.\n",
      "But back to the manifesto. Elbaz described in a preview how hed been struggling to work through the puzzles confronting designers in a digital age. What is relevant today? Is it need or provocation? Can fashion and theater coexist? He concluded that he should try to show all-encompassingextremes, and, just as importantly, leave evidence of his work in progress. We saw that human touch in the black dresses that were collaged from several types of lace and the lines of white basting stitches left in the folds of a black gazar skirt. Still, there is little need for backstory explanations when the transcendent desirability of clothes speaks as directly to an audience as it did tonight.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lela Rose,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Lela Rose did a lot of hiking this past year, and this season she wanted to bring the overgrown fields of wildflowers she stumbled upon during her rambling walks onto the runway. The challenge, then, was how to incorporate floralsa done-to-death spring motifin a new way. Rose was more interested in the endless variations  present in nature than anything else, so she injected her blooms with surprising hits of metallic and neon pink and yellow for a twist on the classic pattern. She also played around with texture and embellishments. In addition to her signature fil coupe, there were metallic tweed dresses hemmed with fringe, jacquard stamped with metallic, and even a blush skirt and shell top combination that made a case for crochet after dark. \n",
      "Rose is perhaps best known for her feminine and romantic dresses, and while those were on full display, the designer also showed shes willing to forgo some of the sweetness for a little freshness. A blush jumpsuit would have been saccharine with a full bow at the waistinstead, Rose left the knot slightly undone. A white shirt and short combo, which almost appeared to be made from a sporty mesh, turned out to be made from a perfectly country clubappropriate white eyelet. Her willingness to get outside of her comfort zone worked in her favor for the most part, but it also led to a few missteps. A gray knit dress felt a bit out of place, and some of the crystal embellishment verged into tween territory. \n",
      "But Roses customer is not necessarily after anything groundbreaking, and there were plenty of looks that were just plain pretty. A white organza gown embroidered with white flowers would make a stunning wedding dress, while a cotton poplin shirtdress with a wide metallic hem proved that Roses grown-up elegance can indeed be artfully translated for day.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lemaire,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"The Uniqlo and Lemaire collection goes on sale Friday at Uniqlo stores, including the one here in Paris near the Palais Garnier. We spied at least one editor plotting her purchases on her phone; Im planning on spending a thousand dollars, another confided. Christophe Lemaire and his partner, Sarah-Linh Tran, have been instrumental in setting the current vogue for a covered-up, calm, yet alluring silhouette. For women who crave the look (and men; theyve also done a mens range with a restrained, uniform-like sensibility), the chance to get it at Uniqlo prices is too good to pass up. \n",
      "Back at their own label, Lemaire and Tran continued to work within their familiar framework. Fringed scarves tied high on the neck and leather boots with woven espadrille soles gave the collection a slightly Spanish flavor. Otherwise, the tailoring was away from the body, perhaps more than usual, with side seams curving around the legs of pants, causing them to bell at the hem. Lengths were midi and longer, and aside from a single off-the-shoulder top, there was little in the way of skin. Skin is something this show could have used more of. A couple of the models were swimming in their artist smocks, and the dress-over-pants situation felt heavy for a Spring collection. Were not calling for a volte-face here, just recognition that the collection tilted a touch too austere. That said, there was romance if you looked hard enough. Je suis belle on me la dit (Someone told me Im beautiful) was printed in lilting script at the bottom of a soft white blouse. Indeed, the model who wore it was.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Leonard,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"A brazenly colorful Leonard show took place just steps from the Andy Warholwallpapered faade of the Muse dArt Moderne, where a new retrospective on the artist opened last week. Whether sheer coincidence or timely homage, the collection, which remains overseen by Parisian designer Yiqing Yin, stayed loyal to the Leonard archivesno soup cans, bananas, or hibiscus flowers. But the saturation of hues, dynamic pattern arrangements, integration of graphic text, and repetition of screened images all traced back to an unmistakable source.\n",
      "Yin cited an urgency for what she called a livelier look when describing how the filmy printed organza, lacquered eel skin, and woven leather sneakers and sandals all appeared triple-dipped in primary pigments. But the show introduced these elements gradually; the opening grouping featured faint rainbow crosshatching, with the diaphanous skirt prettiest of all. As the lineup transitioned from white as its anchor, to red, and then to cobalt blue, Yin applied increasing creative license to the heritage; slick Windbreakers and color-blocked dresses with deep draping and frisky cutouts were the most street-influenced shes gone so far. In some cases, too much print mixing turned chaotic. Backstage and off the runway, however, these same pieces proved rather refined.\n",
      "The museum retrospective happens to be called Warhol Unlimited. Leonard can pursue this same artistic intensity and distinctive vision as long as it accepts that some of its longtime customers might not be willing to come along for the ride.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Les Copains,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"The Far East has been exerting an influence on some of this seasons catwalks. China and Japan are obviously more than booming markets; paying homage to their cultural heritage while enticing a massive customer base with a huge spending potential is on every brands radar. At todays Les Copains show, creative director Stefania Bandiera was following the already ripe trend. Backstage she mentioned a muse who was a modern Madame Butterfly, a contemporary geisha, an educated traveler, an art lover. Being a contemporary geisha might seem like something of an oxymoron, but Bandiera appeared positively unfazed. Kimonos and samurais, cherry blossoms and peonies, exotic birds and birch forests, Ming porcelains and lacquered reds, camellias and Silk Roads: With the exception of Marco Polo, all the obvious references were present.\n",
      "The collection was built around the elaborate jacquard and knitwear techniques for which Les Copains is known: Circle skirts with asymmetrical hems were paired with folded bustiers cinched at the waist with elasticated obis or worn with thick hand-knitted micro tops; short peplum dresses were cut with an elegant origami draping effect. High-waisted trousers were elongated and fluid; they were topped by short, sporty blousons made with what Bandiera called virtual, illusory knitwear, a sort of virtuoso technique of weaving an extremely thin yarn to achieve a delicate, barely there look. They added a modern, energetic spin to a collection that, despite all the overly literal, hypercharged references, looked quite balanced and wearable.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Libertine,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Every designers worst nightmare? Johnson Hartig just lived it when UPS lost a pair of boxes in transit to New York City containing not a couple, but 20 to 30 of Libertines key garments for their Spring show. Fortunately this seasons offering was a larger one than usual for the label, but Hartigs team still had to scramble for 48 hours to make tonights show come to pass. A punkish, DIY ethos has always characterized the designers work, and on tonights runway there it was, writ large. (Its also the subject of a forthcoming Rizzoli coffee-table book about the label, out later this month.)\n",
      "Had the show notes not told of the calamity, youd never have guessed it had occurred. Here was a collection as deliciously profuse as any of Libertines past efforts, with inspirations that included fluorescence cell research and Staffordshire dogs. The latter came after a World of Interiors spread on Hartigs home decreed that Johnson Hartig is making Staffordshire dogs cool again. And so the traditional porcelain pooches came to be one of the collections reigning motifs, seen sparkling on the front of the killer opening coat, or printed all over a caftan.\n",
      "The fluoro cells lent the clothes a goodly dose of Day-Glo, and appeared as electric-looking microbes on a mens sweatshirt; microscopes could be spotted among the eyes. There were also Buddhas, beakers, and perfume bottles on various toppers. Speaking of outerwear (a Hartig forte), among Springs highlights were a cream-color trench with ambiguous, drippy-looking blobs rendered in pink studs, and a stunning brocade coat with the wordswhat else?Joie de Vivre emblazoned across the back. More references, more fabrications, more fun. Look at the great Bergdorf Goodman exclusive hand-painted clutches from illustrator Donald Robertson, who sat front row alongside one of the loftiest iconoclasts of them all, Iris Apfel. On the bags youll find Morticia and Gomez Addams, a crimson pout, a forkful of spaghetti, and God knows what else. Heels, meanwhile, came tricked out with Day-Glo plastic chains. How does the Libertine woman walk with all those chains clacking at her feet, you ask? As she does all things: unapologetically.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lisa Perry,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Theres no doubt that Lisa Perry knows how to create a summer-ready wardrobe, and today, with temperatures surging up into the 90s, her light dresses in punchy shades could not have been more appropriate. The collection was a direct response to the artist Robert Irwin's series of paintings Whos Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue? And Perry was evidently not afraid, with pieces like a shift dress in bold Piet Mondrian tiers of black, white, red, yellow, and blue, and a swing dress dotted with geometric shapes in the same color palette. Perry also used jewel tones in a set of cocktail looks: a royal blue dcolletage-diving dress and a high-neck crimson frock.\n",
      "For those who prefer more toned-down hues rather than the standout color wheel, there was a charming set of little black dresses, including one with spliced sleeves and a dickey collar, and a midi dress with patent-leather piping. Minimalist adornments elevated the more pared-back pieces: A black linen tunic had large grommets on bell sleeves, while a white halter dress used the grommet as a loophole for the neck strap.  \n",
      "In addition to the muted and primary color palettes, Perry didnt forget her signature shock of hot pink. It was there in a long T-shirt dressa perfect piece for anyone who fears nothing beyond the red, yellow, and blue.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Loewe,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Im interested in leather techniques and innovation, said Jonathan Anderson. I want to work with that, and to sharpen the edge. He was speaking at the conclusion of a Loewe presentation that threw out hard-to-define imagerya bit spacey, a bit 80s, but in another sense, totally grounded in a house reality. Give or take a couple pairs of plastic-wrap trousers and transparent pants, the show Anderson pulled together was essentially a brilliant walking exhibition of accessories. He is a curator with an eye for placing multiple products in an interesting context and making them wantable from many angles.\n",
      "Take the jewelry. Once youd seen the gold bracelets with their gold fringes pouring down the hand, the eye was inevitably drawn to the bags and the variety of things that were happening with the signature Puzzle shape. I wanted the bags to articulate the look, to electrify it, said Anderson. The house of Loewe is an old, established Spanish fine leather company, but Anderson understands that nothing could be duller than to dutifully put a luxurious leather coat with a matching bag. His project is to de-bourgeois-ify the context, and thats how he came up with the device of using man-made materialsPVC, injection-molded syntheticsnext to the traditional: I thought, what else could be like a second skin?\n",
      "Whats really clever is the way every look can be parsed down to desirable components. Where there are impossibly wearable plastic wrap pants, there is also a regular sweater with a sheer yoke destined to go straight to retail. Where theres a showpiece tunic, covered in smashed mirror pieces, so are there dozens of buyable shard earrings. Alongside the avant-garde Puzzles there are just as many made in beautiful leather and suede. Equally as smart is the placement of the wholly normal within this new hyper-styled arrangement. There was nothing at all outrageous about the superfine, patchworked suede tracksuit in this showits the sort of leisure purchase Loewe has been selling to its existing customers for decades. Now maybe a fashion-bent trophy hunter will be looking for that sort of thing, too. In that way, Anderson is keeping everyone happy: editors and photographers wholl want to shoot the extreme image, as well as fashion-conscious shoppers and the people whove been buying Loewe as part of a lifestyle for years. Not to mention the brands owner, LVMH, which must be standing back and admiring what Anderson is doing for the bottom line by now.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Longchamp,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"And here are the handbags, in the back, if youd like to see them, too? Ah, yes, the handbags! Longchamp sells a great many of those. Since 1993, more than 32 million examples of one model aloneLe Pliage, its signature nylon or all-leather totehave dangled from tasteful wrists around the world. Which made Sophie Delafontaines question a telling one, for by placing this ready-to-wear collection at the front of her presentation and tucking that core product away at the back, Longchamps artistic director was making a statement: Were not just all about about the bags, capisce?\n",
      "Which is kind of true. With great restraint, Delafontaine resisted any urge to garland her RTW-clad lookbook models with too many of her handbags. But when she didand once you had seen both front of presentation and backit became apparent how closely the design notes of the two categories aligned. So a sweet, simple, graphic, and slightly oversize T-shirt of soft pink cut by thick black lines at the waist and sleeves matched exactly the colorways of a leather reversible tote next door. That pink brushstroke print featured on the clothes (most successfully on a summer-night white zip-up coat) as well as the bags, as did the stripes in monochrome and two shades of green. Ditto the interestingly shimmery metallic finish that was rippled with orange and yellow. The standout pieces were the most straightforward; the contra-color popper-pocket shorts and skirts were supercute, as were the raw cut, fabric-lined leather bombers. Depending on what you wear under it, the transparent hooded mini trench could look pretty good, too. And that solar flareeffect leather in a little ripcord hoodie would make fine music festival outerwear. This collection is a rather literal exercise in brand extension, truebut it contains some attractive and wearable pieces that could serve as usefully in a summer wardrobe as a Le Pliage does in your hand.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Louis Vuitton,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 7, 2015\",\"We exist on the digital frontier, at the dawn of a virtual age in which all experience will be filtered through screens. Nicolas Ghesquire, long one of fashions most intrepid designers, isnt looking back. Since he arrived at Louis Vuitton in early 2014, the idea of travel has propelled him; Vuitton has been in the business of making luggage since 1854, after all. But this season he took a different kind of journey. We are all living with this new dimension, he said afterward. We are all managing how to integrate these new notions of digital, virtual, and cyber with our real life.\n",
      "A conversation between technology and nature animated the new collection, his most audacious yet for the house, and one that had his fans chiming, The old Nicolas is back. The old Nicolas was a sci-fi obsessive and an experimentalist, qualities he subsumed early on during his tenure at LV that came rocketing to the fore here. His reference points were many: Wong Kar Wais 2046 and the anime series Evangelion came up backstage. The show itself started with an introduction to the video game Minecraft, which will be familiar to anyone with young children. Later, a sound clip from Tron: Legacy, the original of which was a favorite movie from Ghesquires own childhood, played. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer, Jeff Bridges intoned. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought Id never see, and then one day . . . I got in. \n",
      "Ghesquires cyberpunks wore moto jackets and metal-embroidered skirts, laser-cut leathers and beaded knits that coded like armor, and spaceship-print pants. Leather gauntlets keyed a tough, aggressive attitude, but the designers vision was not a dystopic one. On the contrary. He was quick to point out that his materials looked high-tech but were actually not synthetics at all. What with the nailhead-embroidered peasant dresses, the crafty sweaters, and the festival-girl crop tops and shorts, Vuitton Spring looked a lot like a digital bohemia.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Luisa Beccaria,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema meets Marisa Berenson: As far as inspiration goes, thats a daring match. But for Luisa Beccaria, it was a successful one, at least in the garden, where the action for her Spring collection took place. It was a quite literal celebration of flower poweror an homage to a horticultural obsession. Billowy dresses bloomed with a lavish abundance of lilacs, roses, carnations, irises, hydrangeas, tulips, violets, cornflowers, periwinkles, cyclamens. Printed or embroidered in exquisite appliqus, they called to mind From Marie Antoinette's Garden, a recently published tome that praised the encyclopedic love that the French queen had for all the flowery specimens she tried to grow at the Petit Trianon, her pastoral retreat.\n",
      "Ever the romantic, Beccaria indulged her passion for long, ethereal gowns in wispy organza, lace, and chiffon: They had a prairie-chic spirit spiced up with a hint of folklore. Seventies bohemian silhouettes added a fresh spin to an ultrafeminine lineup of Empire-waisted frothy dresses with bouffant sleeves and coquette dcolletages. Wide-brimmed straw hats and languid floral scarves completed the bucolic look. The crowd of posh mothers and daughters, part of Beccarias loyal family-and-friends audience, looked very pleased, ready to order dresses that would be perfect for weddings in historical Tuscan villas, or tea parties in manicured gardens.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lutz Huelle,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 12, 2015\",\"To hear Lutz Huelle speak about his clothes is to be on the receiving end of all sorts of mini revelations. To wit: I like that something appears sexy because the person inside it decides it is going to be sexy. The supporting evidence: a trench coat or gray jersey tunic that could be unzipped from the shoulder down the arm. Or else hell consider how a garment might exist in a fixed seductive state of sliding off the body; this he did by suspending the core of black parka from diamant straps, flipping its raison dtre from outerwear to evening attire. Huelle operates from the premise that his designs need to end up being worn; otherwise, as he puts it, Whats the point? But his application of elasticized seaming to alter volumes, or the flapper fringing spilling forth from a boxy blazer also backed up his belief in eccentric simplicity.\n",
      "There were other indications throughout the Spring collection that this under-the-radar Paris-based designer studies construction without overthinking it. A dress pleated from neckline to hemline was bookended with circular denim sleeves; the result was slouchy yet flattering. If the pliant meshakin to citrus-fruit nettingseemed less essential than other pieces, it also layered the looks with unexpected edge. Speaking of unexpected, Huelle arrived at his final looks by accident upon realizing that the sheer perimeter of an embroidered sample made for a dynamic overleaf. He loved the idea so much that he tacked an oversize square of black silk onto the front of a white T-shirt dress. How easy, how right.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Lyn Devon,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"In the age of diffusion lines and fast-fashion collaborations, where designers are brands and celebrities in their own right, Lyn Devon is a breath of fresh air. Despite having been in business for 10 years (an accomplishment in and of itself) and enjoying a loyal customer base, Devon is far from a household name. And thats just fine. She prefers to stay small, focusing on longtime private clients, whom she often hosts in her atelier, housed in a cozy Upper East Side town house. It suits me, she said during an appointment. I like having a mom-and-pop vibe.\n",
      "Devons design aestheticwhich she describes as elegant, put-together clothes her clients, who tend to fall between the ages of 35 and 65, can throw on and then forget aboutis as quietly powerful as her business strategy. This season she took inspiration from origami and traditional Japanese dress to surprising, if subtle, effect. Paper-thin dresses and tunics were hand-painted by Japanese artist Ken-Ichi Takahashi with botanical and pastoral scenes, and the designer introduced a gorgeous pleated hakama pant in khaki and dusty pink. Most items in the collection were unlined, to emphasize a certain weightlessness and ease of dress. For Spring, Devon said, she thought the idea of tying yourself in felt romantic, and so several of her dresses and coats came with a long ropelike belt that could be left off or wrapped around the waist. It gives the wearer some autonomy, she noted. A washed silk coatsomewhere between a robe and a trenchwas a prime example of Devons sweet spot, the kind of effortlessly chic piece women on either end of her core age spectrum will fall in love with.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,M Missoni,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"The unrelenting pace of fashion can make it feel a bit like a circus, so why not channel that into a collection inspired by trapeze artists, tightrope walkers, and other high-flying acts? M Missoni is one of the few brands that would go for such playful inspiration; its signatures include Lurex, unexpected color combinations, and ribbed knitswhich, taken together, can lend itself to circus iconography. Plus, M loves a theme: Last season it was all about Texas, while other past references have ranged from Shanghai to Little Red Riding Hood, done with a wink and plenty of sparkle every time.\n",
      "Some of this seasons updates were bold and exaggerated, like high ruffled collars (evoking Pierrot clown costumes), lion prints, and graphic, swirling shapes inspired by big-top tents. Elsewhere, the whimsical theme was a bit more subduedsee the rainbow-striped jumpsuit, bow tie details, and color-blocked macram skirt. For those who cant quite get behind the ringmaster connotations, though, you cant beat M Missonis classic knits. Clingy sweater dresses and ribbed wide-leg pants in shades of lime, fuchsia, and lavender would make familiar yet fresh wardrobe additionsespecially if you buy the star-printed sneakers to match.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,M.Patmos,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"For Marcia Patmos, everything always goes back to travel: The ability to seamlessly unpack ones life in a different place is a central concept of the brand. Her past collections have referenced far-flung locales like Uzbekistan and Japan, but this season Patmos trained her eye a little closer to home, drawing upon summer nights spent in the Hamptons and Montauk.\n",
      "Imagining the kind of thing youd want to pull on as the air grows cooler at the beach, Patmos created an array of cozy transitional pieces, like a chunky cardigan scarf worn around the shoulders with two deep pockets, and a poncho-like contraption that read as a dress and could be worn over a bathing suit or a full outfit. Patmos is not a girly girl, but she wanted to incorporate ruffles into the collection, partially because she had let her imagination stray slightly to Cuba. She did so in the least twee way possible: on a slouchy gray cardigan and the sleeves of a white T-shirt. She also made a good case for knitwear for eveningan open-knit metallic tank with a fringed hem was a standout. Its the kind of thing that will work even if the only island you inhabit next summer is Manhattan.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Madewell,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 27, 2015\",\"Why mess with success? Under the direction of Somsack Sikhounmuong, Madewell has proven itself to be J.Crews most solid bet in the face of financial troubles. With the designer shifted over to improve the fortunes of the big sister brand this summer, new Madewell creative director Joyce Lee has stayed his winning course in her first outing for the label (a Madewell vet of seven years, she worked closely with Sikhounmuong before his decampment to J.Crew). It was a little sweeter, perhaps, but whats arguably most remarkable about Madewell is its knack for conjuring up a convincingly familiar quality in spanking-new, mass-market clothing. Plenty of the styles here looked as if they had seen a road trip or two, or at the very least were ready-made for making memories in. Consider unexpected vintage touches, like custom embroidery (Springs high-waisted flares plus cheeky cherry-red script is a combo that will be hard to beat) or the cosmic cowboyesque stitching on the back of a fatigue jacket. All that 70s-hued bohemia found a foil in girlish pieces such as striped rompers and frocks edged in broderie anglaise. But perhaps most charming (and savvy) of all was Lees choice to introduce collaborative styles, including price-friendly patchworked jeans in partnership with insider-y favorite B-Sides.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maison Kitsun,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"You can take the Kitsun girl out of Parisdrop her down in Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Manhattan, saybut you cant take Paris out of the Kitsun girl. The Spring images suggest she has ended up in some sort of Dadaist dream, a desert locale care of Pierpaolo Ferrari, where mountains of gold foil rise from the sand and red doors lead to nowhere. In Look 9, in which she is eclipsed by a pair of enormous lips, the grid-printed dress-parka combo reads unquestionably Kitsun. Ditto the floral-brocade bandeau and high-waisted shorts. The womenswear is reliably gamine that way. A jersey Teddy jacket and pochette bearing familiar block lettering are true to character; the mini empire of Maison Kitsun has risen off the backs (and fronts) of those eager to sport sweatshirts that spread the word. But the generously proportioned dress, midi skirt, and white suit in Looks 6, 18, and 20, respectively, are evidence that the brand understands it must grow up if it is to grow out.\n",
      "If eternally youthful cocreator Gildas Loac speaks as confidently about the overall directionincluding international customers and store expansionsas he does fabrications, he can also cherry-pick pieces that show off how far Maison Kitsuns clothes have come. Mixed-knit gauges and sweatshirts shaved down to create a mesh-like pattern, for example, represent ideas that will continue to be developed. Desert theme or not, the collarless utility jacket in slubbed cotton, Japanese indigo leisurewear, and patterned tie-front sundresses are instantly likable items that refresh a wardrobe without going to extremes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maison Margiela,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"A girl in a giant green beehive with silver petalpainted eyes, wearing a 50s three-quarter-sleeved clutch coat and a pair of pointy white pumps with bulbous molded heels and toting a capacious white bag was the opener. She marked the takeoff point for John Gallianos most rounded and product-filled Maison Margiela collection so far. Lo-fi, sci-fi was his tagline for it: words that came via email rather than straight from the designers mouth, as he doesnt appear at the end of his shows nowone of Margielas house traditions he surely values.\n",
      "But this was a wholly Galliano trip, not an old-school Margiela one. He made a delightful merge of vintage-y eccentricity, Japanese geisha styling, and colorthemes that have constantly been part of Gallianos design territory from the beginning, of course. The good news was that, despite the extreme teased updos and his casting of several androgynous boys to wear dresses, this was not one of his excursions into a fantasia of old: He had grounded it in a slew of believably wearable clothes, for the first time since he arrived at Margiela. At one end of the spectrum, there was crystal embroidery resembling dangly earrings smothering a mint green 50s coat; at the other, a pragmatic tailored grass green suit with skinny trousers and a body jacket. In between, plenty of skirts that might make us think differently about narrow, just-above-the-ankle proportions, maybe worn with fitted peplumed tops. And then, for evening and events, numerous dresses in extraordinarily subtle combinations of kimono-inspired prints and tintsas well as a glimpse of a gold satin bias-cut slip dress of the kind the designer brought into fashion in the 90s. Galliano is back on his game againa relief for those who supported him in the first place and a thrill for another generation whove grown up to see him through new eyes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maison Rabih Kayrouz,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Imagine you could temporarily step away from your life and escape to some far-flung corner of the world where a lover awaits; what would you want to wear? Rabih Kayrouz offered this as the narrative for a wholly desirable lineup that did not require a backstory to leave a lingering impression. He bookended the collection with two very different dresses in the same papery, ribbed white organza. To start, a generous caftan punctuated with placket and side pockets just barely tacked down; to finish, a floor-grazing gown free of finery. In between were traces of tailoring that imbued the looks with assured grace, from a jumpsuit that folded and flushed around the body to smoking jackets furnished with a fluted overlay offering hands a place to hide. \n",
      "The seductive touches were just as tacit: slender slits, extended arm openings that converged at the waist, or a double set of dress straps framing the dcolletage. Similarly, the djellaba-inspired robes and fluid draping transmitted the weightlessness of a consummated love affairthe frisson of the body at its freest. Suddenly, theres nothing to restrict, said Kayrouz backstage. Its very pure this time. Arguably, it was also expressivea motif of rainbow ribbons projected pure optimism, while a green hue that evoked antique banker lamps suggested his muse wasnt all that concerned about staying inconspicuous.\n",
      "The fact that the collection unfurled to the soulful songs of Millie Jackson struck a chord; in the absence of the actual escape, these clothes were channeling the longing. They almost made the heart achein a good way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maiyet,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Resort was Declan Kearneys first outing as the new creative director of Maiyet. It was a breakthrough moment for the brand. A veteran of Alexander Wang and Jason Wu, Kearney injected Maiyet with a fresh vitality, turning out clothes with a high desirability factor. The pea coat in particular made the top of a few editors wish lists, but there were plenty of other great pieces to wear, too. Today marked Kearneys debut runway show, as well as Maiyets first in New York after a few years in Paris, and retailer turnout was high. \n",
      "The brainchild of Kristy Caylor, Paul Van Zyl, and Daniel Lubetzky, Maiyet is an American-born company with a global perspective, one that enlists artisans from around the world to weave silk or do beadwork and reinvests in the artisans communities. Its a noble mission. The thing is, women shop with their heart, not their conscience. Kearneys Resort clothes appealed to both.\n",
      "He aimed high for Spring. Amelia Earhart and NASAs unsung mathematician Katherine Johnson gave the collection a utilitarian backbone. Arizonas Antelope Canyon inspired the striated swoosh motif that appeared on a few loose shifts. Knits were a highlight, especially a chunky ribbed T-shirt dress that was accessorized by a Bolivian macram scarf and a tunic-length plaid knit sweater worn over a hammered silk slip dress, one of the shows dominant silhouettes. The burnout velvet numbers at the end were luminous. But overall the collection suffered a bit for its washed-out palette and felt a bit flat. If Kearney failed to raise pulses quite as high as he did with his first effort, he has the time and, more importantly, the talent to raise the bar.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maki Oh,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" October 19, 2015\",\"Eh, whats the point? That, in a nutshell, was the thought galvanizing Maki Ohs latest collection. Lagos-based designer Amaka Osakwe likes to draw on unexpected themes, but a tribute to human futility may be her most far-fetched yet. Osakwe was thinking about Sisyphus, she said, and Camuss quote, Our life is built on the hope for tomorrow, yet tomorrow brings us closer to death, and the Yoruban trick, among parents, of sending their bored kids around to nearby homes in search of arodan, a thing that doesnt actually exist. The Almodvar film Talk to Her and the karuwai courtesans of northern Nigeria were bouncing around Osakwes headspace as well, making for a rich brew. Which, in the end, was the point: Life may be futile, Osakwes collection posited, but it is also deliciously full.\n",
      "Osakwes engagement with existential absurdism freed her up. There was a new sense of looseness in the silhouettes, witnessed particularly in Osakwes terrific, fluid trousers, and a refreshing playfulness found in the collections rather daffy approach to embellishment and print. Scalloped edges, thread embroidery, a dash of distressed denim, graphic appliqu, feathers, fringe, Lurex meshOsakwe had at it, coercing coherence from the mix with her innate sense of discipline. She gave herself permission to experiment, in other words, but the overall effect was far from slapdash. And a few of her flourishes had a philosophical weight one doesnt often discover in clothes: Note, for instance, the indigo teardrop print, which, when you peered inside the tears, revealed an underprint of delicate flowers. Osakwe is a designer with an urgent need for her clothes to mean something; this time out she encompassed that meaning in looks that were her most wearable yet. Why wear a relaxed, ruffled dress of geometric black broderie anglaise? Why not? Life is short. We take our pleasures where we find them.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Manish Arora,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"Backstage before his show, Manish Arora introduced Bunnyla, a floppy-eared fashionista who would be making several appearances on the catwalk, in some cases enrobed just like her model chaperones. The designer then revealed Bunnylas belly ring and the condoms tucked into her bejeweled briefs. For writers accustomed to finding young women in a state of undress, the sight of Arora enthusiastically lifting a stuffed toys skirt might have been a first. But he did this by way of explaining how the Spring collection marked a departure into adult territory. Why be pigeonholed into couture tracksuits for raver girls when he could stretch his wings with glamorous gypsy dresses for disco queens? Most noticeably, Arora swapped the moon boots for metallic platforms by Terry de Havilland and kept his lineup light on pants (the handful of mens looks notwithstanding). In turn, he went extra-heavy on full skirts in highlighter hues, shoulder- and midriff-bearing tops trimmed with laser-cut filmy fringes, and minidresses exploding with plastic flowers. \n",
      "When asked why he pushed into a more feminine, arguably costumey register at exactly the moment that people are gravitating toward sport clothes, Arora joked, How much more could I do?, adding that he wasnt so much concerned about his customers maturing as elevating his psychedelic aesthetic to a new level of luxe. But by now youd think he might realize how easy it is to overdose, and past a certain point in the show, the groovy, folkloric buzz wore off. Luckily, he was saved by veteran model Debra Shaw, who brought a welcome dash of diva to his decadence. Bunnyla, meanwhile, will be multiplied many times over for retail.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Mara Hoffman,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Mara Hoffman isnt afraid to take her inspirations literally. Willie Nelson was the starting point for her Spring collection, and you could sense it from the first look: Nelsons beloved song Blue Skies was playing, and the set was decorated with a bright sky backdrop that mirrored the models own sky-print suit. The girls even sported Nelsons signature waist-length braids, in case you didnt pick up on the reference. But the musician has a very particular take on Americana, which presented a new challenge for Hoffman, whose print-heavy collections are known for being exotic. She updated Levi's by embroidering them with cornstalks and experimented with classic shirting silhouettes, but she also made a point of casting diverse models to represent Americas rich blend of cultures.\n",
      "What really felt new for Hoffman, though, were the tomboy looks. Slouchy overalls, boxy suits with bolo ties, and button-down shirts with popped collars were some of the most masculine clothes shes done, but she was drawing from her own personal style: My collections are really feminine, but more often than not Im in vintage jeans and a shirt buttoned all the way up, she said. Of course, that can be really sexy: Even Hoffmans most covered-up propositions, like the closing looka sheer, star-embroidered shirtdress layered over matching wide-leg pantsfelt alluring in an unexpected way.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marc Jacobs,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"New York Fashion Week began and ended with giant spectacles. Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy show was contemplative, or at least set out to be; Marc Jacobss tonight was a clamorous, exuberant affair. Both got the public involved: Its still hard to score access, but the shows are less and less an insular, insiders-only experience. \n",
      "Circumstance forced Jacobs out of his usual venuesometimes the Army needs the Lexington Avenue Armory. He said he jumped at the chance to show in the Ziegfeldas a native New Yorker, he grew up seeing movies at the famous theaterand that the innovative setup was custom-fit to the special location. Marc Jacobs: One Night Only! blazed the marquee. Inside, there was popcorn and fountain drinks; cigarette girls offered candy; and ushers dispensed Playbills (not a mixed metaphor, the original Ziegfeld showed musicals, not movies) as they led celebrities like Bette Midler, Winona Ryder, Sandra Bernhard, and Sofia Coppola to their seats. Outside, models including Bella Hadid, Guinevere van Seenus, Emily Ratajkowski, and the singer Beth Ditto walked the length of a red carpet that stretched for half a block, stopping for a picture at the Marc Jacobs step-and-repeat, before they made their way up the stairs and into the theater, where we watched the street-side happenings on the Ziegfelds giant screen. \n",
      "The show was a love letter to the movies, Americas greatest invention; to America itself; and to a New York City thats all but vanished. The Ziegfeld is the largest surviving single-screen theater in Manhattan, and trumpeter Brian Newman and his band played punk progenitors the New York Dollss 1973 song Trash. Nostalgia is the most powerful force in Jacobss work. This season he indulged his insatiable, catholic tendencies: High culture (Maria Callas as Medea), low (showgirls), and things in between (Janet Leigh in Psycho) mingled on the runway. You couldnt help but think that Andy Warhol would have appreciated it, not least of all because some of the prints were suggestive of the Pop artists silkscreens. \n",
      "Its the kind of collection that will reward an up-close lookdense with detail and hidden meanings, and totally irresistible.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marcelo Burlon County of Milan,Kerry Olsen,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"The entertainment multi-hyphenate Marcelo Burlon naturally didnt opt for a static presentation to showcase his burgeoning brand, County of Milan. Having sprouted from a T-shirt line into a label stocked in hundreds of global stores, his womenswear now includes leather outerwear, Italian embroidery, and allover printed tailoring. And for Spring, the show producer, events planner, musician, artist, and social media magnet channeled his disparate skills into the evenings artistic pursuita dance performance choreographed by Kirikoo Des.\n",
      "His tribe of dancers (which included a voguing champion from the House of Ninja and a French Lido dancer) were clad in County of Milan garb and writhed to a soundtrack composed by Burlon and Davide Squillace. It was an arresting sight, especially in a darkened theater, one the Argentine creative director said he used to frequent when he dreamed of becoming a dancer.\n",
      "The collections motifseagles, snakes, and graphics taken from a Lamborghini and Burlon collaboration moved to the beat, with a 3-D projection playing in the foreground. It was at times awkward when some of the dancers yelled out, but still such a welcome change from the usual show format. Also unusual: Despite the fact that the Milan designer has captured an Instagram following and the fact that many well-known photographers were in attendance, few showgoers were unable to take their eyes off the choreography and the clothes. Applause instead of phone photography at a runway show? A rare sight these days, indeed.\n",
      "Afterward, flicking through his lookbook, Burlon said he specifically chose to incorporate the poncho into his Spring collection. While elsewhere it may be considered a winter garment, in his native country the blanket-like cloak is used to fend off the sun; in gold-embossed silk, it is bound to appeal, as are his new buyer-friendly denim separates (the line sells at Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue). Motifs such as wings were taken up a notch from allover prints to metallic embroidery on the back of leather jackets, silk tops, and even slides. It was a smart act to follow for the casual crowd.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marchesa Notte,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 18, 2015\",\"As any department store shopper can attest, the biggest problem with designers lower-priced labels is that many fail to capture the magic you see on the runway of their main line. For Marchesa Notte, the sister collection of Marchesa, that usually isn't the case. Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig launched Notte back in 2007 to give their couture customers slightly less-fantastical options for garden parties, weddings, and other nonred carpet affairs. With a more approachable price point to matchdresses range from $800 to $1,000Notte has also become a go-to for high school proms. Girls who are still dreaming about the bird-inspired, Jordan almondcolored fairy-tale gowns that hit the Marchesa runway a few days ago will delight in the fact that Notte pulled inspiration from the same places.\n",
      "The big difference was in the silhouettes, which were just a bit simpler. They lent themselves equally well to Marchesa propers rose gold embroideries, petal appliqus, and tasteful cutouts. An added bonus: Most of these dresses were relatively ageless, save for a blush A-line minidress with tulle overlay and life-size flower embellishments, which would look particularly sweet on younger girls with sneakers or gladiator sandals.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marchesa,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"They dont refer to fashions flock for nothing: Keren Craig and Georgina Chapman looked to the skies for inspiration for their Spring collection and found it slightly closer to earth in a botanical menagerie of caged birds. These were represented by fluffy feathered skirts, 3-D embroideries of flora and fauna, artfully arched modesty-preserving wings, and colorful dcollet accents poking out from the bodice of sleek corsets on red carpetready gowns. \n",
      "Sheer boudoir-inspired evening looks in black and nude Chantilly lace provoked further rumination on the caged bird concept. The sweeping, ombr-dyed tiered tulle trains in shades of sorbet caused a riot of Instagram snaps among a front row section occupied by a gaggle of Disney Channel starlets, eager to scrum for their debut in the larger celebrity ecosystem. (On the other end of the spectrum and the runway was Bette Midler, to whom a thickly jeweled, sheer-shouldered gown in deep navy was of significantly more interest.) And what else is Marchesa for, if not exquisitely rendered red carpet moments for ones own inner Disney princess? That a few of the dresses left some runway detritus (a fistful of feathers here, petals of tulle there)turning a devoted Harvey Weinstein into a quick one-man clean-up crewonly proved that even the brightest peacocks among us have to return to reality now and again. And you know what they say about birds of a feather.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marco de Vincenzo,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Since his earliest days on the Milan runway, Marco de Vincenzo has distinguished himself by his use of embellishments. He has a fine eye for the way color, pattern, and texture can highlight and accentuate a womans body. Up until now hes taken inspiration, when it was obvious at all, from his base in Rome, but a recent trip to Japan inspired todays exploration of Eastern motifs. The red disc of Japans flag appeared on a couple of tops, and Mt. Fuji featured on one or two others. De Vincenzo used silken kimono fabrics for a handful of coats that did a nice job of straddling the day-night divide. \n",
      "Owing to his decorative tendencies, De Vincenzos eveningwear has received the lions share of the presss attention. Picking up where his Fall collection left off, he made a strong effort here to broaden his before-dark offerings. A fanciful kind of girl will appreciate the outfit that combined an over-printed silver leather jean jacket, a rainbow-striped collared shirt, and a lavender pencil skirt in a squiggle motif that was echoed on the metal heels of strappy sandals. De Vincenzo was fairly brazen about mismatching patterns here, and it totally paid off. \n",
      "It was with some of the eveningwear that he stumbled. A wisp of a dress with a single breast in ruffle-swathed optic lace probably shouldnt have made it out of the atelier. The underwire detailing on other dresses proved almost as distracting. Elsewhere though, the tinkering paid off. Chiffon shredded like confetti read like fur from a distance; in the hand it was almost preternaturally light. In a bid for the minimalists in the room, De Vincenzo showed midi-length gilets and flared pants in the fabric, in monochrome black and white, but it was a true marvel on a coat that shaded from black at the shoulders through white, red, and blue to a deep yellow band at the hem.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marissa Webb,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"No matter what the latest trends are dictating, the concept of high-low juxtaposition will always be in style. Marissa Webb has built her business around contrasts like masculine and feminine, hard and soft, edgy and sweet. For Spring, Webb didnt veer too far from those signatures, but her inspiration lent a fresh, genuinely new angle. After flipping through old 1950s photographs of her grandfather Albert decked out in military fatigues beside her grandmother, who favored prim dresses, she realized how great those uniforms would look mixed together. The result was a collection rich with texture, color, and volume. \n",
      "Instead of adhering to one specific vibe, Webb tends to play with mini themes throughout her collections; here, there were neon orange lace dresses, grungy plaids, and a pale pink skinny suit, which offered a slicker take on Le Smoking. But the best looks featured some kind of vest: a plaid-and-lace dress with a leather pinafore-style vest, or a swishy floral gown topped with an abbreviated army jacket. From a distance, the vests and dresses appeared to be fused together for one easy piece, but shoppers will be able to buy them separately come next year. That kind of styling trick calls to mind Webbs career-defining stint at J.Crewarguably the harbinger of the modern mash-up lookbut perhaps well see more of those mixed references at her Banana Republic presentation this Saturday.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Markus Lupfer,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"As fashion formulas go, heaping playful decorative motifs onto a template of featherlight streetwear seems promising. And it certainly succeeded for Markus Lupfer, who this season presented a confident, tight variation of his it-just-works recipe. His theme was so out of left field as to seem arbitrary: flowers and Mexican wrestlers. As he explained it, I envisaged this hard desert land. Then it starts raining and fields of flowers bloom. Chrysanthemum embroideries rustled around illustrations of ham-thighed, colorfully masked wrestlers on T-shirts and sweatshirts made of French lace, or black organza skirts, shorts, and bombers. Chokers and vulcanized skater shoes were garlanded with more blooms in beads, pins, and sequins. An appliqu wave rippled across more organza, while Lupfers strongest traditional evening proposal was a rose-gold flower-heaped fil coupe shift with a layered underskirt. Printed drawstring silk-mix track pants, shorts, and tees, meanwhile, were the pieces you could imagine buying and wearing straight out of the store. Imposing sometimes-borderline OTT decorations onto elevated versions of pieces that so many young women wear every day is a pretty sweet niche, and Lupfer has clearly made it his own.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marni,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Mentally undressing models is not the usual activity of a fashion reviewer. Were here to evaluate clothes, not bodies. But at Marni, the mind couldnt help inquiring: What was happening under all those triangular, asymmetrical layers? The suspicionhope, evenwas that it might be a simple, anchoring slip, as the back views of some of Consuelo Castiglionis looks gave a glimpse of satin and straps. From the front, the rigid leather and ponyskin camisole-like aprons and tunics of her first outfits seemed a clue that she was presenting an abstracted thought about the key garment of the season. Later on, the shape reappearedat times as long dresses in oversize sport mesh, other times as plain wool structures with geometric chunks cut out of the skirtsand always amongst assemblages of other garments. That adds up to a lot to put on, all at once.\n",
      "Marni is a brand with a woman-friendly reputation for color and print, and this collection did have plenty of it. Castiglioni proved her eye for the right orange red, tobacco brown, and bottle green, which few designers would dare place in the same collection as egg yolk yellow, primary blue, and shell pink. But it was with her giant leaf prints on graceful elongated tunics over fluid trousers that the collection really hit its stride. It was then that the anxious viewer stopped worrying about what it would feel like to manage all those semi-garments and began to appreciate the chic neo-moderne metal and dangly acetate earrings and chunky lacquer bracelets that are such a Marni draw. No one will ever want this brand to go minimalist, but when Castiglioni shows a little less, she makes her customers want her more.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Marques ' Almeida,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida arent abrasive, rebellious-seeming people at allif anything, they seem pleasantly down-to-earth (Marta) and almost shy (Paulo). But these two, apart from being incredibly hard-working, are also quietly obstinate about going their own way.  From the beginning, they took what seemed an extreme path with their super-shredded denim, in direct opposition to what some young Londoners call Downing Street fashion (i.e., the tendency toward a pretty party dress), and kept their sights on doing clothes for real street. As Marta Marques often says, the benchmark they always use is whether her 22-year-old sister Sofia finds their clothes acceptable, and whether normal girls can find the prices within the realms of affordability.\n",
      "Well, the extent to which that stubborn luxury-resistant policy has paid off can be seen not just in the innumerable Marques  Almeida pieces in evidence on the Fashion Week crowds, but also in the influence of this Portuguese couples work has had on mainstream manufacturing. If 2015 is the year a pair of ripped-knee jeans made its way into every girls wardrobe, thats thanks to Marta and Paulo.\n",
      "Which is why the great and the good of the fashion firmaments of many nations battled through torrential rain to a north London warehouse to witness what Marques  Almeida is offering this spring. Answer: more of the same destroyed-yet-practical glamour for street, bar, festival, and pub. Maybe its the combination of the designers Latin genes and their 90s-revering generational taste that made them come up with ruffles (that wave thats rippling across fashion right now) and transparency. In their book, though, the ruffle-fronted shirt has gone wild and raw-edged, roughly chopped into dense halter-bibs, while the flounces run across sheer chiffon or down into shaggy-fringed denim skirts.\n",
      "If at times the deconstructionism got a bit too skimpy, things took a turn for the far more interesting when the couple started taking on new fabricsslubby-beige linen and burlapand working in a crackly-surfaced patent leather and chocolate brown suede. There was a traily grunge-by-way-of-Galliano feeling and a tinge of 90s romanticism going on as well, butrememberthese designers are not the kind of people who spend their nights partaking of any louche party scene. As realists, they are carefully deepening their brand by simply reproducing their most-liked shapes (jeans, oversize biker jackets, halters) in different fabrics. Clever.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Martin Grant,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Post-show, Martin Grants supporters congratulated him on what they felt was his best collection yet. Not that they were wrong, but it prompts the question: based on what? Heres one theory: It felt thoughtfully composed. Grant picked up where his pre-collection left off by reintroducing the linen-wool blend that he uses in place of denim, as well as the silk organza feathery tinsel, aka his summer fur. And once again, he barely left the confines of black, warm white, and navy. The printsa paint splotch and a medley of stripeswere created by hand and counterbalanced the rough-hewn silk and double-face cotton with rhythmic lift.\n",
      "Theres a chance that Grants women offered such unanimous praise because he left out the pieces that, in previous seasons, existed to attract younger customers to the label. Instead, he seems to have realized that neckline emphasis is good, waistline emphasis is better, and slimming emphasis is best of allno matter the age. Furthermore, the eveningwear optionsfrom chemise and ball skirt to elongating jumpsuitoozed urbane chic.\n",
      "Ultimately, Grant doesnt leave a writer with much to reportno theme, inspiration, muse, or talking pointswhich might give the false impression that the collection was light on ideas. Was it his best? Perhaps only Grant is equipped to judge. But judging against his recent endeavors, it was right up there.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Mary Katrantzou,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"It is weirda sort of barely conceivable telescoping of timeto realize that Mary Katrantzou graduated from Central Saint Martins, M.A., in 2008 with precisely 10 shift dresses, each of them digitally printed with oversize images of jewelry (the evidence is in the archives of Vogue Runway). Well, look at her now, seven years on, filling the atrium on the Central Saint Martins campus with a large, immensely intricate body of work framed around Roma gypsy dress and cosmic stargazingall of it visible in a vast mirror that reflected the lineup into infinity.\n",
      "The G-forces exerted on any designer whose business has taken off so rapidlyKatrantzou sells around the world noware extreme. But the remarkable thing about her is how she has adapted over that time, always carefully paying attention to critical feedback as she speeds forward. After breaking new territory with digital trompe loeil prints, which all too swiftly became a widespread style throughout the fashion world, she turned away from her computer and went into handcrafted embellishment. When people criticized her for being a decorator, she moved on to experimenting with sculpted shape. And when the response to that hinted that her experiments might be getting too cumbersome, she came back with what she presented tonight: a collection that combined tiny flower prints, micro sequins, and metallic quilting in weightlessly fluttery forms.\n",
      "It is interestingmaybe even disturbingto wonder why so many designers in Europe have been thinking about the folkloric costume traditions of the peoples of the Balkans, Romania, Hungary, and farther east. Can it be that the consciousness of mass migrations in the daily news is ending up processed into floral prints and collaged patchworks on pretty, fashionable dresses? If so, then Katrantzou is not the only designer or label that has become porous to those subconscious influences. Mini-rose prints on a black background even turned up on the Topshop runway four hours before Katrantzous show and, before that, in many variations, in the British designer Stuart Veverss Coach collection in New York City last week.\n",
      "But Katrantzou, in her intelligent way, senses the danger of being boxed into a trend. In this outing, she also showed she can take on the challenge of proving shes able to design without print, without color, and without embroidery or texture. Her passage of pieces involving solid black material, cut with couture-like exactitude into A-line skirts and fit-and-flare coat silhouettes, was surprising yet instantly desirable. Compared with the clothes she was making when she came out of CSM, this collection bore almost no relation stylistically. The only link between the two is lodged in Katrantzous constantly self-challenging brain. And the intellectual result, whatever it might be, elevated this season to another plane.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Maryam Nassir Zadeh,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 22, 2015\",\"Summer may feel like a distant memory now, obscured by the fracas of fashion month, but the season came to vivid life in Maryam Nassir Zadehs latest offering. The designer imagined it as a series of distinct, personal chapters. The first was bright, open, and inspirational, colored by the time she spent traveling with her family in Italy; a heady vision of days in Palermo, Rome, Puglia, and Capri. But vacations always enda second chapter told the story of returning to New Yorks harsher, often tumultuous realities. Zadehs denouement lands somewhere in the middle: grounded in a life at home, and informed by the perspective of time abroad. \n",
      "The designers Spring lineup was an organic expression of those ideas, not too beholden to plot. There is a certain intimacy that seems to mark Zadehs clothestheyre both familiar and uncanny. Take the gentle volume of a sculptural metallic organza bomber or crisp poplin dresses, which came unexpectedly tied, halterlike, at the neck. Ensembles were alternate strokes retro-beachy and rustic; likewise in palette, pops of lime and cherry red drew a sharp contrast to shades of blush and gold that recalled the gessoed walls of Zadehs summer travelsa lovely dissonance. \n",
      "Still, for many MNZ shoppers, the biggest news here will be the exciting trials in reworked denim. A pair of pants, patchworked in varying washes from cornflower on up to indigo, will be a sure sellout, ditto a softly fraying jacket made from a pair of jeans.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Max Mara,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Nautical has been in style in summer at least since Coco Chanel set sail around the Mediterranean with her lover, the Duke of Westminster, in the 20sand even she cant claim to have invented it, since earlier examples of sailor collars and boaters go back to Edwardian times. Why else would we automatically call a certain shade of dark blue navy? So for a purveyor of classics such as Max Mara, the theme is a natural and obvious one. And theres nothing wrong with obvious! Faced with the oceans of mucked-about and difficult clothes that are proffered as fashion, how astonishingly nice would it be to know there was one store where perfectly cut sailor pants, striped Breton T-shirts and jerseys, peacoats, and the like are reliably available?\n",
      "Max Maras creative director, Ian Griffiths, should not fear that this could be a boring missionthe fact is that non-bonkers, non-branded classics can actually also be synonymous with cool. In his presentation, there were plenty of garments that might fall under the classification of great genericsthe sort of clothes that could live with you for years. He threw in a couple of novelty notesthe star-pattern knits (no doubt inspired by officers epaulets) and prints of ropes on silk piecesand he couldnt hold back on some quirky styling, extending the sleeves of stripy tees and doing up jackets and coats on the wrong button,  la 80s John Galliano. As a matter of fact, Griffiths really doesnt need to try to dress up Max Maras classics in that sort of way at all. One day, he should see what happens if the company simply marches out 30 variations of a single garmentfar from narrowing his audience, he might just convince the young as well as the middle-aged and senior among us. After all, the democracy of chic has no age limit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,McQ Alexander McQueen,Nick Remsen,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"One thing you may not have known until now: Sarah Burton, in addition to her role as creative director of Alexander McQueen, is also in charge of McQ, the labels contemporary line. McQ was brought back from the licensing world five years ago, and has steadily smoothened and shaped itself as McQueens sportier complement, with an underlying war cry of corrupting the everyday.\n",
      "With a focus on New York in the late 70s to the mid-80sthe no wave art movement, especiallyBurton and her team came up with a collection that was both kitschy and hard, invigorated by graphic elements like polka dots, silvery metallic leathers (even in dress form), and chain accents. As for the latter, Burton suggests wearing them as suspenders, belts, or necklaces, or all at the same time, and layering them with abandoneven over something as lo-fi as an outsize white T-shirt and an ivory-hued skirt. The strongest pieces here were the polka-dot numbers, namely so in the form of a silk georgette long-sleeved, floor-scraping dress, punked out with yet another chain. Likewise with rose lace options, these all held a touch of the macabre romanticism that Burton has woven into McQueen proper. It would be nice, actually, to see more of this element as McQ continues to develop.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Melitta Baumeister,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"New Yorkbased Melitta Baumeister considered scrawling legible writingcatchphrases, evenacross her glossy vinyl bonded garments before settling on black spray-paint tagging and white chalk paint. I like the illegal aspectthat something beautiful can be defaced and appear destroyed, she said from a rental apartment in the east stretch of Paris. Surface patterning, no matter how unruly, marks new territory for the young designer, who has become best known for using slick, stiff, and spongy materials that arent traditionally wearable. On that count, shes progressed, too: For Spring, Baumeister used second-skin viscose Lycra to offset her exaggerated volumes. But lest this sound like shes conceding to retail imperatives, the details were as fetishist as everthe bodysuits zippers ran from nape of neck all the way around to the front of the crotch. And she figured out how to affix nipple ringtype hardware to a top (and elsewhere, to coat closures) so that people can experience the shock value sans pain or permanence. Simply by keeping strict about her silhouettes (hey, its all relative), Baumeister is showing maturity. But for all the checks, there remain a few imbalances. The back of a padded apron dress consisted only of a harness. Add a pair of pants or skirt and the front becomes maternity wear.\n",
      "In a perfect world, Baumeister would prefer her looks be worn in full, an admission thats equal parts understandable and unrealistic. In February, one or two of them will be featured in BeautyCooper Hewitt Design Triennial.  Her work will fit right into an exhibition setting. But its clear that fitting in has never been her goal.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Michael Kors Collection,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"At Michael Kors Collection, Spring 2016 had a curious but possibly telling dichotomy running through itminimal androgyny in neutrals on the one hand and flowery womanliness in pretty colors on the other. In a way, it looked as if two collections had been chopped up and merged together, so that, to quote from the show notes, you had, for example, Lisa wearing Look 13, white linen gauze duster, white tissue linen tank, white linen gauze utility pant, followed by Lindsey in Look 14, a lapis poppy-print georgette dress with frayed floral embroidery.\n",
      "Michael Kors is one of the great American storytellers of New York fashion, and it scarcely needs to be reiterated that his narrative about a serene, discreetly moneyed, and always optimistic lifestyle is enthusiastically (and lucratively) received far beyond the United States. Would those followers be puzzled by the two strands running through this show? Unlikely, for both come from the traditional American playbookstripped-down-90s, utilitarian, go-to-work tailoring, and decorative dresses for entertaining and special occasions. In other words, this was a collection that covered the social waterfront, with everything from Korss classic tan suede trenches and billowy poet-sleeved blouses with drawstring necklines to an evening shirtdress with vertically inserted strips of sheer Chantilly lace, all of which looked good.\n",
      "But perhaps the underlying contrasts between those two aesthetics is also an unconscious reflection of two rival themes that have emerged this week at the New York showsthe celebration of cleaned-up grunge-era style, which is everywhere, and the newer backlash toward sophisticated, pulled-together feminine dressing weve seen from Peter Copping at Oscar de la Renta. As it happens, with his poppy prints and fil coupe fabrics, Kors was on almost exactly the same page as Copping, so no matter how his customer feels like playing it come next season, Kors has her covered.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Milly,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"A return to nature is already a big theme for Spring 16, but Millys Michelle Smith was perhaps the least likely designer to go there. Over the past few years, her collections have been all about sporty fabrics, graphic colors, and structured silhouettes, so Spring was almost free-spirited in comparison. Smith said she wanted to capture the ephemeral feeling of a summer romance, but not in a clich way (read: no billowing chiffon or girly florals). Instead, she relied on texture to give familiar, minimal garments a new sense of ease. \n",
      "Denim linen felt particularly fresh for Milly. A strapless, no-frills gown would be just as chic with flat mules or strappy stilettos, and thats exactly the kind of versatility women are looking for these days. Asymmetrical skirts in fluttery silk cady also fit the day-to-night bill, as did a range of crispy poplin shirts and dresses. When you really stopped to think about it, though, this collection was more about an attitude than anything else. Sure, you could see a beach sunset in the rich papaya-and-gold jacquard pieces, and plunging necklines exposed a sensual flash of skin. But it was also interesting to see the way Smith layered a miniskirt over an extra-long shirtdress or how a bias-cut slip dress floated around the body just so. Its those quieter details that added up to the chicest real-life looksthey left room for interpretation. \n",
      "Backstage before the show, Smith said it all felt like entirely new territory for her. But what designer doesnt love a challenge? With sport references on the sharp decline, this looked like a promising new direction for Milly.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Mira Mikati,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 22, 2015\",\"Mira Mikati set the bar high at her debut last season, thanks, in part, to a cameo collaboration with artist Darcel Disappoints (Craig Redman). For her follow-up, she recruited Kaws (Brian Donnelly). The three special-edition, multicolored varsity jackets they did together favor Mikatis buoyant vibe more than the grayscale angst of Kawss Companion character. Zoom out to the full collection and theres no escaping the fact that fun is her driving forceand, for Spring, a fantasy road trip across America. At a presentation space filled with cactus balloons and bold city signage, she showed off how workmanship and a personalized touch elevated her ideas beyond the realm of camp. Do not disturb me appeared laser cut and outlined in embroidery on the back of a cotton linen car coat, rather than simply printed. A comic cityscape pattern inspired by a coloring book featured crayon contributions from her children. \n",
      "If drawing from Santa Fe and New York in equal measure risks a disparate representation of styling souvenirs (from bohemian suede and a crochet poncho to a shrunken blazer and sleeveless trench), the predominance of whiteright down to the sneakersbalanced all of the layering like a gallery backdrop. Indeed, the progression of the narrativefrom Wake up for Fall to Sleep all day for Springsuggests an outward expression of Mikatis inner dialogue. But as much as the text sounds refreshingly unfiltered, design is a creative exercise in filtering, and to her credit, she creates clothes, not wearable art. Of course, at the rate shes going, she might just convince the likes of Murakami or Space Invader to join in on the fun. Shes certainly sparked the desire to collect.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Misha Nonoo,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"For Spring 2016, Misha Nonoo presented a series of eminently wearable, tomboyish coveralls, flirty A-line skirts and culottes in all shades of rusty poppy and chalk white denim, and breezy and bright pajama-style suiting. There were baby blue cropped T-shirts embroidered with in-jokes (Darling, Naughty Square, So Real Surreal); breezy white summer separates, and swinging bell-sleeved knit frocks, and all took inspiration from no less than the Bauhaus movement, minimalism by way of Donald Judd, and what Nonoo called a 1960s, 1970s cool girl vibe. \n",
      "Honestly, everyone does the same thing in our industry, so how do you stand out? asked Nonoo, who chose to opt out of the New York show schedule and instead debut her designs in a one-two wallop of a freshly created Instagram account as well as on the backs of a bevy of handpicked fashion influencers, from Lena Dunham and Olivia Palermo to New York City Ballet principal dancer Sara Mearns and Linda Rodin, who will post selfies in ensembles from the collection on their own accounts today.\n",
      "When you have most of your front row built out of people with huge social media followings and what you really want is for them to go to your show, take a picture, and share it with their followers, why dont you just get to that point first? asked Nonoo, who shot her parochial schoolinspired box-pleat pinafores, graph-paper-checked shirtdresses, and grosgrain-trimmed jacquard sundresses at Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn, orienting the results to a horizontal, wallpaper-style scroll (users will be directed to flip their iPhones) for the new account, and who estimates that the cumulative followers of her international band of influencers total somewhere around 8 million. (And without a single seating chart!) The thought, Nonoo explained, is that rather than have everyone come to her, shell go to where the action isin the steady grips and handbags of fashion editors, fans, and her customers. Ultimately its all about the asset in the first place, so if you can create even better assets, even more stylized assets, said Nonoo, then why not just do that?\n",
      "Its worth noting that she has recently found success going her own way, with the December launch of an in-house e-commerce site proving both fruitful and educational, insofar as connecting with the Misha Nonoo customer. Things are changing, the designer explained, doing this beautiful, very art-directed shoot in a space that I love, that I feel super-comfortable in, for me, its showing more about my brand and my collection and the environment and the ethos and the philosophy than 15 minutes on a runway. Only time will tell if her followers earn that designationbut its a heck of a start.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Missoni,Alessandra Codinha,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Turns out, you really can go home again. For Spring 2016, Angela Missoni took her brand back to its roots: Sportswear! exclaimed the designer backstage before the show. Her boards were full of photographs of Maasai tribespeople (Africa being, as Missoni noted, the roots of humanity) and the graphic, street-centric work of the Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez, whose colorful, kinetic crosswalks inspired the runway. Yet the show was full of the bright, breezy, vibrant type of jet setready attire that has made the house iconic for decades. \n",
      "The silhouette was long and lean, with narrow, sweeping cardigans paired with hot pants, fete-ready halter-neck dresses in vibrant metallic pleats, and open-collared tunics paired with flowing trousers. Swimwear boasted generous looping ties or thick, layered Maasai-inspired collars. Fitted, striped polo shirtsthe type of thing Missoni fans have long scoured vintage stores forfelt like a slam dunk. Before we were a zigzag, we were a stripe, said Missoni backstage, and for a house with an innately bohemian attitude (and during a season full of splashy, occasionally bewildering debuts), you cant get more straightforwardor more comfortingthan that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Miu Miu,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 7, 2015\",\"Miuccia Prada is interested in the political and the pervy. Always has beenbut especially now. Todays Miu Miu show had kitschy nylon-looking negligees layered over sweaters and gingham shirts; it involved wintry purple and green lozenge-patterned narrow coats and midi pencil skirts, fur stoles and boxy Deco-patterned cardigans. Anxious that this doesnt make sense? Dont be. That is exactly Pradas point. Though the outrageous glam rockmeets-Kiss multicolored patchwork platform boots are her other point, obviously: They might as well have had Buy Me Now picked out in the glitter on their heels.\n",
      "It all came out in an end-of-season conversation in the dark at the conclusion of the Miu Miu presentationthe show at which the audience is always stir-crazy after looking at clothes for 28 days in four cities and not exactly feeling entirely compos mentis. Neither is Prada, who talked about how she had to put together both the  mainline Prada collection and Miu Miu in the midst of dealing with the passing of her 103-year-old aunt, Nana, whom she described as a second mother. The designer wasnt at the Prada show, so this was the first time she surfaced in public this season. Really, Miu Miu was about irrationality, she began. The times we are in are extreme. Theres conservatism on both the right and left in politics. And then, people look for escapes from it, attracted to strange religious beliefs or underground clubs and music. One of the underground clubs shes thinking of is definitely kinkya sexy salon, she quipped, laughing as she indicated those see-through negligees, which were caught up in quite a few looks.\n",
      "As so often was the case this season, the assemblages on this runway seemed made to be pulled apart, layer by layer, and absorbed into a womans wardrobe in whatever manner makes sense to her. The ways of high-fashion styling are indeed extreme, but surely even the most ambitious blogger wont be daring enough to parade herself in the full Miu Miu rig in front of next seasons street photographers. Ladies suffering from dementia may be seen going out shopping thus attired, forgetting in which order the nightie goes on, but mimicking them in full may be a few steps too far down the road toward kooky delirium for most.\n",
      "On the other hand, there were the aforementioned boots, a major draw in a season of loudly decorative footwork, not to mention more conservatively sweet ballet slippers (again with a touch of the confused in their mismatched ribbon ankle ties), tiaras, ruffle-neck blouses,aSwan Laketutuand within it all, goth black-and-white silk pieces printed with candles and cigarette lighters, surely a mini collection unto itself. Theres a method to Miu Mius madness after all.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,MM6 Maison Margiela,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Todays gritty MM6 Maison Margiela runway presentation was a flashback to the industrial techno dens of Londons subterranean club scene. In a cavernous corner east of the city, representatives of the MM6 collective wore anonymous white lab coats. The disruptive mood was cemented by the huge bank of analog recording equipmenta wall of sound, if you willthat formed the backdrop to this retro-futuristic warehouse party. As models took to the stage, they stopped to tinker with the equipment as if to create their own soundtrack to what was a hypnotic display. These club kids came well prepared for a long nightpacking Coke cans, beers, and even plastic banana holders in their Perspex cross-body bags (how else to stylishly sustain an all-nighter?).\n",
      "MM6 mainlined the chaos and creativity of post-gender club kids beautifully. This was an idea-packed show with more than one standout moment: There were eagle and equestrian prints, glitter-bombed fanny packs retooled as tops, and plastic bin liners fashioned into everything from a surprisingly elegant blouson to detachable pouf sleeves and a cerulean sundress. Ideas were pulled from not-so-distant eras, then reappropriated and repeated. There was also a prettiness here (for both boys and girls) in the pink metallic Ziggy Stardust two-pieces, and sheer dresses in khaki and pale blue that tied at the neck with pussy bows. MM6, surely, is a place for its group of designers to have fun mining the dress-up box of recent history. But the models, with determinedly blank stares and hunched posture, resembled androids, giving fun a far-off feel.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Molly Goddard,Lynn Yaeger,LONDON,\" September 18, 2015\",\"When you are grown-up, its easy to long for the carefree, entirely fictional days of youth, and forget the reality of dreary schoolbooks and even drearier summer jobs. Is it any wonder that as you take your first steps into the adult world, you so often arm yourself with powerful fashion fantasies? \n",
      "Molly Goddard, in her latest presentation, had her real girl models working at a replica of a sandwich factory, but they were going about their soul-numbing tasks in clouds of tulle and smocked raw silk ivory frocks. Is the designer telling us that this is the way life should be, that we must assert our fierce conviction that inside we are all fairy princesses! All ballerinas!regardless of what life holds for us at the moment?\n",
      "Certainly, this young designer is striking a chordduring recent Fashion Weeks in London and New York, numerous fashion editors (including this author) could be seen squeezing into tiny show seats swathed in billowing Goddard tulle. In this latest outing, Goddard offered her classic outsize silhouette with a few new embellishmentsa lovely acid green tutu featured hand embroideries; tiny pink skirts were awash in burgundy ruffles; and there were tartan dresses that seemed like the fantasy version of a school uniform that some little girl, who cant wait to grow up, is dreaming of.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Moncler Gamme Rouge,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 7, 2015\",\"The program notes described this latest Moncler Gamme Rouge collection as Versailles meets Abstraction, which doesnt immediately call to mind luxe sportswear but does suggest something rather rarefied. And perhaps this has been the modus operandi of the Gamme Rouge range all alongyet it was never more apparent than today, when a mass of maidens ambled up and down a garden path (more enchantingly English than formal French) in looks that married haute couture with high performance.\n",
      "After a tender exchange with Lee Radziwill, creative director Giambattista Valli explained how a plumped-up slicker in technical lace, flounced dresses in embroidered PVC, a gray sweatsuit embellished with lilies of the valley, and a leotard in red jacquard all expressed varying degrees of the same elite inspirations: fencing and French chteaus. Indeed, when the bar is set this elegant, a parka is no longer a parkaits a rococo confection in guipure that happens to be rain resistant. Moncler gives me the technical fabrications and the support, and I do it in an atelier way, Valli noted as Bianca Brandolini dAdda planted a kiss on his cheek.\n",
      "The designer conceded that the Spring offering always poses a greater point-of-view challenge than Fall because outerwear isnt the customers priority. With this one, he plucked more elements from historical dress than usual; yet the floral-embroidered sneakers (and sneaker boots) kept the feeling decidedly fresh. Though there were quite a few dashing black looks for evening in the mix, such a predominantly white collection might send another message to his gilded lilies. Said Valli, I love the idea that Gamme Rouge is sporty but you can get married in it.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Monique Lhuillier,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Monique Lhuilliers front row was an apt description of where her brand is headed these days. Bella Thorne, Ashley Madekwe, and nearly a dozen other pretty young things were decked out in the velvet floral dresses and tea-length party frocks that defined the designers latest Fall and Resort collections. Considering that youth was one of the themes Lhuillier name-checked at a preview last week, those are just the girls who will want to wear Springs super-bold looks on the red carpet.\n",
      "Lhuillier has certainly never been afraid of color, but in this collection she turned the vibrancy up to the max. Bright poppy, lipstick pink, electric blue, and tangerine silk gazar made for sweet, sculptural shift dresses as well as more directional looks, like an emerald tunic over skinny jacquard flares or a turquoise bustier top with a trailing sash. Either of those pant-centric ensembles would be an unexpected choice for, say, a New York movie premiere or press call. Structure was a big message, but a parade of feather-light gowns in paint-splatter prints (and minimal embellishment) lent a more ethereal, artsier tone. The accessories were also hard to miss; its still a new category for Lhuillier, and here she made the case for matching your shoes to your outfit with jewel-like Lucite wedges and embellished sandals. It felt as though she designed them specifically with the red carpet in mind.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Monse,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Aspiring young designers have two new role models to look up to: Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, who presented their first collection for Monse on Saturday afternoon. The duo met during stints at Oscar de la Renta, where they discovered their own strengthsKim as design studio director, Garcia as a top designerwhile learning from a beloved industry legend. \n",
      "For their buzzy debut, which saw Prabal Gurung, Domenico De Sole, and Ruth Wilson sitting front row, Kim and Garcia presented an original yet approachable vision. We like the idea of relaxed glamour, Garcia said before the show. A classic shirt was the starting point for everything. We realized its something that a lot of people can relate towe just looked at it in a different way. The first dress out was a cotton poplin mini that mimicked an oversize shirt wrapped artfully around the shoulders. It checked all the right boxes: There was texture, a fresh silhouette, and just a hint of charmall in one youthful and wearable garment. It was followed by a billowing maxi dress with a similar wrapped-and-knotted effect. Of course, the construction likely wasnt as easy as tying a bowbreaking down an item as familiar as the button-down shirt wouldnt work unless the craftsmanship was meticulous and a bit restrained. Those white cotton pieces were naturally relaxed, but even the grander propositions in silk faille, taffeta, and duchesse satin felt effortless. We wanted it to look like you just buttoned it up and were done, Kim said. Were inspired by real girls today who wear jeans, flats . . . They want something easy. \n",
      "Its a concept that mirrored de la Rentas own passion for ready-to-wearclothes that make women feel beautiful, without being complicated. You could sense his influence in the rich jewel tones and luxe fabrics, too, and in the 3-D cotton flowers and oversize bows. Prepare to hear a lot more from Monse in the coming months.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Moschino,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Nobody, but nobody is having more fun than Jeremy Scott at Moschino. Season by season, the ideas get zanier, but the productions just keep getting bigger. And why not, when his clothes and accessories are selling so well? True to silly form, tonights theme was car-wash couture. Traffic cones, barricades, and a genuine car wash that sprayed bubbles instead of water were installed on the runway. No Parking, Couture Zone, one sign read; another: Dangerous Couture Ahead.\n",
      "Also true to form, this was not a show about subtext. But if it was all out there on the waxed and polished surface, that doesnt mean it wasnt smart. Take the full-skirted trench coat with a warning sign on the backOpen Trench, it reador the little black dress with the iconic red octagon on the chest printed Shop, not Stop. In a he-thinks-of-everything moment, Scott had none other than Lapo Elkann, international playboy and heir to the Fiat automobile fortune, in the front row. \n",
      "The accessories served up one visual pun after another. None other than Stephen Jones, milliner to fashion royals and royal royals, did the veiled hard hats and traffic cone chapeaux. There were toolbox and lunch-box bags, tail-fin sunglasses, and caution-tape sandals. As for the clothes, they were the tony uptown answer to last seasons below-14th-Street streetwear. Chanel-style skirt suits came in flashy neons with flashier reflective-tape edging; others had Cristbal Balenciagaworthy volumes. Scott played fast and loose with Chanel-isms, most literally and perhaps dangerously with a print of interlocking C clamps. A pair of petticoated satin party dresses with taillights lifted off a 57 Chevy looked like a subtler (if you can call it that) reference to Thierry Muglers iconic corset. \n",
      "An extended evening section that riffed on the rotating brushes of drive-through car washes was capped off by a long column dress with a neon sign slung over one shoulder. Scotts got fans just crazy enough to take it for a spin IRL.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Mother of Pearl,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"There was a quiet confidence this morning at Mother of Pearl. Maybe the self-assured mood was helped along by the historic surroundings of the Caf Royal, but for her sophomore solo show, creative director Amy Powney embraced her pretty pioneer theme with gusto. It all started with Victoriana then took a Midwestern turn, she said backstage. But the real cues came from Laura Wilsons photographs of the Hutterites of Montana, a closed community whove farmed the land of the American West since the turn of the century. These settlers may eschew the technological trappings of modern life, but they sure know their way around a smock dress. And as Bon Ivers Holocene was plucked out on the banjo (what else?), Powney evoked those prairie pastures with a series of piecrust collar shirts, pinafore dresses, and pantsuitssome in decorative sequined ginghams and checks, and others in botanical prints of her own design. It was these trippy patternswhich up close revealed scenes of lobsters carrying combs and narcissistic birds gazing into Alice looking glassesthat were arguably the high point of the collection.\n",
      "In line with MOP founder Maia Normans signature sporty vision, all this was punctuated by some cleaner, sleeker looks. The black bonded leather and neoprene coats worn over scholarly mustard-toned tops and track-y pants were supremely wearable. But Powney never strayed too far from the frills and the flourisheseven athletic sweatshirts were embellished with ruffles and embroidered roses. Add playful footwear to this mixsneaker-soled Mary Janes that were carried through from Resort and pointy-toed 80s bootiesand youve got a collection that is seriously rich in box set inspiration. Pull out those copies of Little House on the Prairie and St. Elmos Fire now.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,MSGM,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Massimo Giorgetti quickly found an audience for his upbeat contemporary brand MSGM, launched four years ago. Street style types scooped it upits bright colors and loud prints are irresistible to photographersand now the label is found in hundreds of stores across the globe. His success landed him the plum assignment of creative director at Emilio Pucci.\n",
      "At home at MSGM today, he tried something new, swapping much of the quirky sweetness of previous seasons for a more tomboyish, wannabe badass spirit. His notes mentioned Catherine Hardwickes skateboard movie Lords of Dogtown, but he couldve just as easily been channeling another subculture turned mass culture, like grunge or punk, thanks to the shredded plaid separates, an oversize hoodie, and long knit pants that pooled at the soles of high-top sneaks. But Giorgetti didnt fully commit, and heavy silver chains wrestled with bows as the shows dominant decorative motif. They first dripped from long tunics and laced up the would-be seams of chain-mail tees and skirts. (MSGMs full-body collars could make 50 Shades of Greys Anastasia Steele blush.) Bows, meanwhile, adorned waistlines and hips, trailing ribbons past the knees. Ruffles were supersized, too. Up until now, the magic at MSGM has been in the mix, but this season Giorgetti's usual irreverence came off more like indecision.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Mugler,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"The ships propeller backdrop and aircraft carrier runway semaphored David Komas theme at Mugler today: military. What, again? The frequency with which the uniform of war is press-ganged by designers intent on crafting clothes to love can seem counterintuitive in an industry based on generating innovation.\n",
      "Donatella Versace just launched her martial-themed Spring 16 collectiona campaign for gender empowermentwhile Chalayans was a typically dense take inspired by the end of Cubas isolation. Every season, for either gender, you can expect a significant military presence. Why? Its not complicated. When done well, military collections can make the utilitarian seem sexy via universally recognizable signifiers.\n",
      "Komas casus belli seemed straightforward, too: Half-hiding behind a mirror to evade well-wishers after this show, the designer said, We have such incredible girls here, and its about being inspired by them. Wanting them to look cool, to look fresh, and to enjoy clothes.\n",
      "He rattled through pretty much every military service. The first wave was naval, an interplay of navy and white with decorative insignia buttons on looks that included an angled peak-lapel, three-button, double-breasted jacket and minidresses that rearranged the fold and contrast of traditional sailor suits. One dress featured a lovely helter-skelter twist of white that twined around the body above a four-button accent. Softer items included an asymmetrical-hemmed pliss dress with half-zip details at the waist. Next into the field came the army; the olive section included a cutaway backless dress in leatherthe top and bottom half linked by a clasp of three gleaming officer stripes. Soft kicky trousers were topped with deconstructed bodices, while the classic field jacket was turned into a sleeveless minidress with silk poacher pocketsa skinny belt peppered with eyelets cinched the waist.\n",
      "A dress decorated with a grid of angular metal openings and dresses crisscrossed with metal-piped slashes were harder to link to Komas theme, although the former did demand the wearer go commando: She must NOT wear underwear, ordered the look-board backstage. Komas body-con brigade kept coming; some in hefty-heeled, pointy-toed, monk-strap flats, some with the straps of their handbags looped through the epaulets at their shoulder. A burst of burnt orange looks ran contrary to the camouflage agenda of real militarywear but had the explosive impact that Muglers customers enjoy. The final push was Doutzen Kroes, looking invincible in a backless navy jumpsuit. This was a deceptively simple but cleverly executed take on military, and it won.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Naeem Khan,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"The seed for Naeem Khans Spring 2016 collection was first sowed in Mexico, where the designer hosted his wifes 60th birthday party. The theme of the three-day event was centered around Frida Kahlo, and guests were encouraged to come dressed the part, flower headdresses and all. That idea carried him on a trip to the Mediterranean, where his fascination with flowers bloomed. Dresses in bougainvillea pink, lilac, and marigold floated down the runway, and some of the most successful looks referenced that influence, including a gorgeous lemon floral-beaded caftan gown.\n",
      "Khan was also thinking of muses like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren; echoes of styles worn by both could be seen in the wasp-waist, full-skirted ball gowns. A lilac gazar number with rolled bateau neckline particularly recalled Kellywell surely be seeing that one on the red carpet soon. Princess gowns have their place, as Kelly more than proved in her lifetime, but Khan would do well to curb his appetite for embellishment here. A dress with a bustier emblazoned with a large glittering heart, for instance, verged into Disney heroine territory. \n",
      "That embellishment worked best when its design wasnt so overt. Backstage, Khan said that 600 people worked on the collection; up close, each gown was clearly a masterpiece, so it was disappointing when the message became slightly muddled on the runway. The sky-high platform heels seemed another misstep, particularly as models struggled not to trip over the delicate skirts. Khan has already proven his skill at creating gorgeous, red carpetworthy gowns; the designer doesnt need to dress it up so much. In fact, as happened with a few looks, the extra fixings detracted from the main course.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nanette Lepore,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"Nanette Lepore always manages to inject a swipe of playfulness into her clothes. Take this season, when the designer introduced her collection at her downtown store, transforming the presentation space into a full-on bash. Ive always threatened to have a big party! said Lepore. And then I made fun clothes that people would want to go out in. The attire matched the carefree scene, ranging from cocktail pieces to daywear, all with references that hovered between the late 60s and 70s (Time periods when everything was happening, said Lepore). That feel-good, let-loose attitude was evoked in an off-the-shoulder black eyelet dress, while a floral-print frock in groovy neon blues and purples had a bohemian swing to it. Cool retro separates came in a multi-patterned jacket with ruffled kimono sleeves and a polished pair of cropped flares. \n",
      "One infusion, however, brought the party into the here and now: that was the segment of the show devoted to select pieces from Lepores collaboration with Eddie Eddie by Billy Tommy, a line of shirts featuring cheeky statements and graphics, worn by Miley Cyrus and Kendrick Lamar. Lepore translated the statement-making text nicely into body-skimming silhouettes, like a Pepto-pink slip dress that was emblazoned with Slippery When Wet and a bubblegum-lacquered midi skirt with a thigh-high slit that had This Is My Favorite Mini Skirt Duh! printed on it. But it was the Tie Me Up Please Thank You tube top, cleverly paired with empire-waist pin-striped gaucho pants, thats guaranteed to keep both Lepores grown-up and teenage customers equally entertained at any party.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Narciso Rodriguez,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Narciso Rodriguez is an engineer as much as he is a designer. Hes always had a thing for seams, and his clothes are constructed like precision instruments. After a Fall collection with elongated silhouettes perched on towering heels that took his preoccupations to extremes, Rodriguez was after something more sensual here. Its a bit undone, he said beforehand. Outfit number one was a black sateen top as glossy as leather that wrapped asymmetrically around the waist above a pair of full white trousers. Not undone by a long shot, but it was definitely more relaxed than what hes been up to the last couple of seasons. It was followed up with an extremely fitted side-buttoning jacket: As a rule, though, the clothes here floated on the body. Silk tees slouched off one shoulder, and dresses twisted around the legs to fall in asymmetrical hems. \n",
      "The gentler silhouette was a welcome development. So too was Rodriguezs use of fabrics with a keen sense of the hand: the sateen that looked like leather and the nubby linen he chose for dresses that arched over one knee, which, by the way, happened to be completely reversible to silk chiffon. Tech fabrics tend to have a flatness that leaves you cold. There wasnt a chance of that here. Rodriguez explained that his starting point was photographs of the ocean floor, but the palette was warm: bright amber, lacquer red, and golden mineral rings that swooped across dresses and encircled others from front to back. The sea creature embroidery on a bias-cut white silk dress was as exquisite as anything well see all season.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Neil Barrett,Dan Thawley,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Many designers are rethinking the way they show their wares to press and buyers this season, and Neil Barrett is among them. In lieu of a jam-packed presentation, the Milan-based Brit hung banners and plastered the floor of his Paris showroom with a camo-meets-kaffiyeh-scarf print, inviting editors one by one to view his entirely colorless Spring collection. Monochromatic, after all, is a tried-and-true signature for the designer (whose womens lineup remains unapologetically rooted in his menswear background) and the East-meets-West military pattern rings true with his rigorous creations that collide historical references through a linear lens.\n",
      "This time around, Barrett shook up that rigor by way of bold fringing and pleat details on slinky separates and accessories that loosened up his sleeveless tailoring and jacquard outerwear with a sporty lan. Fringes can be fussy, but here, sliced bands of black leather and its vegan alternative (a savvy compromise for washable T-shirt dresses) read punchy and sleek as wide belts and slashed skirt layers, both paired with fanning peplum shirts, graphic minis, or a generous fluid pant. Layered in alternating scales, Barretts somewhat militant graphics were softened through their tactile application: Wide cotton weaves and a rich silk jacquard ensured zipped blousons, and bomber jackets held a dressed-down eveningwear potential. Those looks provoked the same twist of tomboy ease he worked into a sleeveless tux jacket thrown over collaged artist tees: The series of three features Picasso, Hockney, and Basquiats faces peeking out from under a kaffiyeh. Its an irreverent remix, and a diabolical sign of the times.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nellie Partow,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" October 23, 2015\",\"Nellie Partow specializes in two very different categories: tailoring and knitwear. Neither lends itself particularly well to the concept of lightness, but thats where Partow got to work on her Spring 16 collection. Earlier this summer, I was just standing in my closet and thinking about how difficult it is to find pieces that are really light and easy, she explained. You see a lot of silks and wools out there, but not really beautiful cotton. So she developed a superfine, 37-gauge cotton with an Italian mill, whipping it into semi-sheer sweaters that scarcely weighed more than tissue paper. Elsewhere, Partow used similarly buoyant materials such as stretch cotton jacquard, fluid crepe, and an airy, weblike cotton ingrained with silk fibers. In layering items like crisp shirts, wide-leg pants, and natty little blazers, those fabrics skimmed the body rather than clung to it.  \n",
      "Partow approached her popular hand-knits with a new sense of ease and structure. Coated cotton held its shape on a boxy cardigan, and different cabling techniques lent a bit of slouch to the designers signature rose gold cutout sweater. I love the idea of one of these knits being your jacket, she said. The contrast between her sharply cut pantswhich have inspired a following of their ownand a nubby, artisanal knit will appeal to women who think about texture and shape before print and embellishment. Partows color palette also mirrored her quiet approach to luxury: Refreshing shades of ice blue and orchid popped against cognac, olive green, and ivory.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nicholas K,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Springs fodder may be new territory for Nicholas K, but suffice it to say, its in the brands DNA. For their latest outing, dubbed Terminal Velocity, the sister-and-brother team of Nicholas and Christopher Kunz looked at flight suits; after all, their father was a flight surgeon, their brother a Navy SEAL.\n",
      "A tenor of utilitarianism was high from the word go, starting with a cream-colored parachute trench worn by show opener Sarah Abney. Like many of the other items, it came with a cross-body rope clasped with a tough-looking carabiner. The light, glossy nylon the designers used billowed like silk, and while it may have been an exploratory move, they ran with it, whipping yards of the fabric into maxi dresses, skirts, and ponchosso much as to blend together at times. With dip-dyed styles, otherworldly-looking silk dresses, and trousers in shades of charcoal and saffron, they had some real winners on their hands. Among the 50 looks, the pair might have done with a few more of the pieces akin to those and their capes in supple periwinkle denim, clothes that nodded to the presence of a human hand. All that nylon felt, in places, a little anonymous, coming up short on covetabilitythough their gorgeous drop-waist jumpsuit in distressed leather surely did not.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nicole Miller,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Nicole Miller didnt have to look too far for inspiration this season. I kind of became obsessed with the grate pattern you see on loading gates, said the designer, who had cast her eye about and found a petri dish of inspiration in her urban surroundings.\n",
      "I took a lot of things very literally from the street, she said. No kidding: One of the recurring prints was of a brick wall plastered with graffiti, and the diamond grate motif popped up on denim and dresses, and also informed a few sexy cutouts. I wanted it to have the grit of New York, explained Miller. Gritty is not a word usually used to describe her brand, and its introduction here may not be appreciated by Millers core customers. However, theyll find plenty to love in the sheath dresses and sequin maxi gownswhether theyre fans of graffiti or not. \n",
      "Some of the strongest pieces referenced other types of paintingless St. Marks Place street art and more Jackson Pollock. Indeed, a black and white splatter print that appeared on handbags and denim instantly recalled the artist. Other standouts included a white sheath dress embroidered with colorful scribbles, and a white organza shift with brick-like embroidery and flower paillette appliqus. This is where the collection hit its stride: when Miller got to what she does best (pretty, flattering dresses) and left most of the grit on the New York City sidewalks.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nili Lotan,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Its a stylists world and the rest of us may well just be living in it. But for her Spring outing, Nili Lotan harked back to a time when raw young talents were creating not only music but the kind of images that are still setting the tenor for much of what the industry strives for todaybefore every on-the-rise starlet had her look carefully crafted by a team of pros. Pictures of Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, and Patti Smith lined Lotans mood board; the designer particularly connected with the earnestness of Vietnam War-era singer-songwriters like Baez and Mitchell, dubbing this collection Blue 1971 in an homage to the latter. Likewise, she called on her own 70s adolescence, when she was beginning to cement the personal style that defines her brand today.\n",
      "Springs free-spirited prcis fell right in step with the codes that have long kept Lotans followers coming back for more: slouchy army pants and jackets, gauzy bohemian tops, and floor-skimming dresses. Resorts bewitching eveningwear,  la YSL, gave way to a mix of casual and rakishly elegant pieces, every one of them a wardrobe workhorse. The smashing sailor pants looked natty against the gritty milieu of this seasons lookbook, bien sr, but would have plenty of Jane Birkin-esque appeal teamed with Lotans plunging blouses in sheer, fluttering chiffon (Serge Gainsbourg and his longtime lover made up the European contingent on the designers mood board). The latter drew a stark and lovely contrast to a grouping of military-tinged items, like a hardy, utilitarian-looking dress in olive drab with gorgeous lace-up detailing. Lotan may have streamlined the offering of her famously lush knits, but with the wealth of winning options here, fans are sure to find plenty to stock their wardrobes till fall.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nina Ricci,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Guillaume Henry has the goodwill of the fashion community. He gave Carven, which was a defunct couture house when he arrived in 2009, a global profile and a distinctive look. Women responded to Carvens gamine sensibility, and the brand grew quickly, opening a store in New York. Tonights show was Henrys second for Nina Ricci, but he hasnt yet found his footing. Its an issue more of tone than execution, though both play a part. His backstage mood board was pinned with pictures of Romy Schneider in the 1971 film Max et les Ferrailleurs, and images of 90s models like Kate Moss, Nadja Auermann, and Kristen McMenamy. Id love men to fall in love with [the Nina Ricci woman], he said. \n",
      "Thats not a bad goal, but this was provocation without seduction, a fact that came down to the stiffness of some of his materials, the sheerness of others, and a generally slack, away-from-the-body silhouette. The shows patent ostrich skin had a glossy, almost lurid sheen, but it was about as unyielding as materials get. The black-and-white cowhide coat and apron-dress werent much more forgiving. This will no doubt make us sound both American and prudish: Considering Nina Ricci is a brand historically known for its lingerie, it wouldve been nice to see a bra underneath Henrys sheer organza blousons. But his see-through wrap skirts were an even bigger miss. The best pieces here were the micro-pliss shifts which enhanced the models natural hourglass shapes. Henry should keep them in mind when he begins working on his next collection.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,No. 21,Alessandra Codinha,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"Fashion may fall head over teakettle for decades in fullOh, the 70s, with their suede and their slouch! Give us a 40s tea dress! Or the 90s slip!but in real life, real women reach into their closets to be confronted with (if theyre lucky) a living record of any variety of eras.Alessandro DellAcqualeaned into this reality with his collection for Spring. Its inspired by Corinne Dayso 90sand the fabulous Tina Modotti, the designer said backstage before the show. Modotti, the actress and photographer, died nearlyhalf a century before Days iconic snaps of Kate Moss, which gives an idea of the temporal range DellAcqua was working with. Its about inverting images, overlapping and reworking, masculine and feminine, and quite sexy, said the designer.\n",
      "There were macram dresses in soft pastel shades, crepe pinafores, and cotton lace with chantilly overlay, all in various stages of tumbling off the body to illustrate DellAcquas pointthough this was less an overt va-va-voom take on sexy than a slightly quiet, Manic Pixie Dream Girl one. (The diamond tiaras tangled in some models hair aided in the latter notion.) Caban-style jackets boasted Latin-inspired ruffles and pom-pom trims; narrow overalls came in lace; wrap skirts made of strips of python leather and worn with striped boxy tops resembled nothing so much as a backgammon boardand oh, the rules of love!\n",
      "There were also, worn under nearly everything, white T-shirts, tank tops, and deconstructed button-downs, with ties left dangling to the wind.Crepede Chine blouses and jumpers boasted a delicate design that, upon further inspection, became a subtle in-joke: lit cigarettes trailing swirls of smoke. (Remember, 90s.) Berbere inspired sandals (pom-poms! feathers! sequins!) were equally anything-goes; and it was all resoundingly for the girl who doesnt dress for the decade shes in (or even the decade she wishes it to be) so much as wholly for herself.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,No. 6,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 12, 2015\",\"As the owner of New York Citys well-loved Centre Market Place boutique of the same name, Karin Bereson knows how her No. 6 customer shops. Her new lineup played savvily to that, with a first delivery that was all about cheery, 60s- and 70s-hued nostalgia for some much needed sunny vibes in the midst of winter, and a second delivery thats all about easy pieces to transition nicely into spring.\n",
      "Of course, ease is a key selling point of all of Beresons wares. Its a subtle evolution from season to season, with familiar shapes making comebacks in cheeky prints or jolie laide colors, but recent collections have found the designers gamine sensibilities imbued by a new feeling of femininity. That came to life most winningly in looks like a pieced-together slip dress in blush linen and silk, which would pair just as nicely with sneakers as it would stilettos. It had a kind of understated sexiness about it that felt like a particularly nice addition to the spectrum Bereson and her team regularly offer up.\n",
      "Still, if many of No. 6s shoppers are longtime clients who keep coming back for classic mainstays like jumpsuits or the labels terrific culottes and drop-crotch trousers, they surely wont bristle at Springs great new expansion efforts. First, and most notably, are four soign footwear styles, all made in Peru and all, as Bereson puts it, shoes that disappear. The eminently shoppable bag offering has expanded, too, building on Resorts leather bucket bag with a half-moon woven shape for the beach and a killer patchworked suede tote. No. 6 first dipped a toe into the waters of swim for Spring 15 and here turned out two bikinis and two maillots, plus a Don Draperpoolside terry-lined shirt and shortsone of the lineups coolest propositions.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Noir Kei Ninomiya,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"And now for something completely different. Kei Ninomiya is quietly and painstakingly riveting together a darkly wonderful body of work. This collection contained more of his inky-black intricately engineered dresses made by bolting scores of curled polyester organdy strips, rendered flowerlike in shape, held together with a skeleton of tiny studs. The dresses contain not a single stitch, and float around the wearer. Ninomiyas shapes were more adventurous this time than last, and featured jagged sculptural protrusions. He has also discovered that when he turns these pieces inside out there is a different texture to their beauty. These are amazing, but challenging to wear, signature pieces. \n",
      "A touch less Lady Gaga but no less dense-with-effort was the dress containing a twist of 7,000 hand-applied beads that took two people three days to construct. That was the longest, said Ninomiya. A biker jacket of transparent vinyl worn over some pinstripe culottes was stitched together with a macram of plastic cord; another biker was decorated with jagged lines of more transparent plastic; and yet another biker, with a satin sheen, featured arms constructed of Ninomiyas signature studded organdy, whose segments undulated over each other and strongly resembled a ravens wings. I make things in a new way, said Ninomiya. And so he does, rather brilliantly.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Nomia,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 23, 2015\",\"Nurses scrubs may not, at first thought, set most womens hearts aflutter. But inspirations such as that underscore Yara Flinns knack for marrying utilitarianism with lean, youthful elegance. Spring found the Nomia designer riffing on workwear of different sorts, from those aforementioned scrubs (nodded to in a sporty V neck) to fabrications in denim ticking, which Flinn stumbled on in researching uniforms at the Mets Costume Institute Reference Library. That ticking came to life beautifully as a kimono with raw denim trim. \n",
      "Consistency is a key element of Flinns lineups from season to season; hallmarks like her patch pockets and D-ring details tie an evolving body of work neatly together. Chances are that her customers can make space in their wardrobes for another of her classic slit-back dusters, as well as a newer style for Nomia, the terrific, slinky one-sleeved dress.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Norma Kamali,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"When in doubt, go with a classic. Today, the All In One Dress, a style Norma Kamali first introduced back in 1973, became the cornerstone of her Spring collection. After seeing a serious response from her distributors, the designer is taking a fresh look at the shape, sending it out in three lengths (maxi, mini, and medium) and a variety of prints. Wear it as-is, with its funnel neck and dolman sleeves, or pull an arm through the collar and wear it one-sleeved, with the other one tied around your waistper Kamali, the possibilities are damn near endless.\n",
      "Even if the DIY opportunities of that piece dont delight, its charm is mirrored in so many of Kamalis garments: Ball them up and toss in a carry-on, throw in the wash, and start all over again. That goes for shapes like her fishtail flare, which kicked out in a full circle from the knee, and some spruce activewear tailoring. While those are sure to please new converts to the Kamali lifestyle, for the customer who comes back season after season, the designer served up a generous offering of new prints, from a splashy painted floral to trompe l'oeil jean patchwork. Even better was the real deal: a series of fraying raw denim styles like a trench and kicky skirt, all reversible, and all very cool.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Novis,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Art has always played a big role in Jordana Warmflash's collections for Novis, but while references to Henri Matisse may have skewed too literal in the past, a more pared-back approach for Spring should catch buyers attention. She drew inspiration from Clarice Cliffs graphic, slightly rustic pottery for her vibrant color palette of mint, cerulean, and poppy, while hits of black and white ensured the clothes were, for the most part, still quite wearable.\n",
      "Sleeker silhouettes helped that cause, too. Column gowns, A-line skirts, and razor-sharp trousers acted like blank slabs of porcelain to be decorated with geometric prints, kitschy landscapes, and matte beading. Print and color are integral to the Novis message, but Warmflash should continue to explore texture, as well. The best pieces featured a soft color-blocked crochet, which captured the theme, but also had a warm, artisanal feeling that will appeal to a wide range of customers.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Oak,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 19, 2015\",\"Our newness right now is not really newness, and to us, thats the newness. Thats Oaks Louis Terline on the tack the well-loved New Yorkbased brand is taking. He makes a valid point: The breakneck pace of not just fashion, but the world, can hardly be sustainable. And so Terline and cofounder Jeff Madalena have zeroed in on their obsessions, the things that keep an expansive demographic coming back to their stores and website; pieces like killer leather jackets, knits, and trousersall at varying levels of inkiness. The other newness? Taking cues from the hip employees of Oaks four shops: pullovers worn inside out, for example, or almost comically oversize. Those styling tweaks yielded coolly subtle reinventions of staple pieces: dropping a sweatshirt shoulder by two inches, or adding, say, 15 to a baseball jacket. Where youth culture in fashion is typically something that has trickled so far down as to be totally divorced from whence it came, something feels authentic in Terline and Madalenas buy-now-wear-now riffs on what their employees are doing.\n",
      "Beyond that, their clothes are just plain cool, and wearable to boot. As Terline tells it, theyre always designing back to the jeans. For Spring, Oaks denim will team with workwear-inspired quilting, and sporty touches like a zip-front funnel-neck topall in the brands signature monochromatic palette. For the record, all that black is as much function as it is fashion, chalked up by the designers to tiny New York City apartments with finite storage, and the citys general grime. But lest things get too geocentric, Terline and Madalena havent forgotten their more far-flung followers: This season for L.A. fans the designers are introducing a lightweight take on their classic motorcycle jacketjust new enough.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Objects Without Meaning,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" October 13, 2015\",\"When will girls stop pining after vintage jeans? The high-rise, straight-leg style (whether actually vintage or just vintage-inspired) has become more than a trendits totally changed the way we dress. Alexandra Michelle was doing non-stretch boy jeans at Objects Without Meaning before everyone else started cutting up their Levis, and she quickly earned a cult following for them. But the key to Michelles success is that she also answers the question of what to wear with her jeans, offering a steady range of luxurious, collectible basics like silk camisoles, ribbed-knit turtlenecks, and linen T-shirts. Her approach is as no-frills as it gets; minimal silhouettes are elevated with comfy, high-quality fabrics, and there are zero prints or embellishments, save for an unraveling hem here or a twisted strap there. It gives her customers room to layer, style, and accessorize as they please.\n",
      "For Spring, Michelle expanded both her denim and basics categories. First, she got a bit more experimental with her indigo: Some jeans had blurred squares of darker blue, mimicking a patchwork effect, while an A-line, button-front skirt had a released hem. She styled it over ribbed lounge pants; elsewhere, some of Michelles best-selling powder-blue flares peeked out from under a tea-length poplin dress. Those new layering ideas felt freshest hereshe also put her own spin on head-to-toe knit dressing and introduced her first swimsuits, which were spare enough to be worn under cardigans and denim shorts.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Off-White,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"For someone who has orchestrated theatrically imposing and occasionally improvised stage environments for Kanye West, a dfil of 20 looks within a compact, contemporary art gallery would seem like no big deal. But as this was Virgil Ablohs first runway show for his label, Off-Whiteas well as his 35th birthdaythe occasion felt, well, special.\n",
      "Abloh titled his collection Off-Day, although not out of some reverse-karmic pre-emptive strike. As he explained, the latest Off-White undertaking emerged from several streams of thought, but principally how cool girls today have figured out that the most relevant dress code has nothing to do with dressing up. Abloh (who earned a masters in architecture) used a white tee and blue jeans as his building blocks, which he subsequently broke down to arrive at a draped crepe tuxedo top, an open-sided gilet, tiered maxi sack skirt, and flocked grid-pattered pajamas, among other transformations.\n",
      "Some combination of cropping, lengthening, offsetting, patchworking, bias cutting, and hand-pleating went into each look. And thats not even accounting for the time Abloh spent at the Levi Strauss & Co. archives (six pairs of jeans were reworked from the companys denim), or going through the necessary legal channels to redesign an old Grateful Dead crew shirt (via illustrator Othelo Gervacio). All told, a lot of effort. And yet, for Abloh, this wasnt enough. I want to push the concept of showing in front of an audience in Paris, he declared backstage. I want it to be a reminder that this is still an art formnot just the clothing but making people gather in a room and creating a moment that opens their minds.\n",
      "Hence the clear plastic coats donned by a handful of models as they took their final walkAbloh plans to produce these for his Off-White staff in the spirit of MargielameetsSteve Jobs: that is, A corporate culture statement coming from someone whos so chill. In the spirit of performance art, a local graffiti artist closed the show by defacing the coats with a dramatic flourish.\n",
      "Guests may have been too ensconced in the rapid-fire tagging to notice a line of lettering placed high on one of the clerestory walls. Positioned upside down, it spelled out Why are you looking at, which Abloh attributed to the ongoing refrain among those who binge on fashion shows so heavily that nothing ultimately registers. So was this show any different? To the extent that it came across as a multilayered exercise in self-expression, yes. But often a single lookthose jeans spliced with organza windowpanes, for exampleis all it takes.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ohne Titel,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Really, there are any number of ways to do summer style. For some, theres the desire for the easy, the breezy, and the often sheer; for others, theres a chain-fringed bandeau and trouser boasting a Justin Bieberesque quasi-harem drape. For either (for both!), there is Ohne Titels Spring 2016 collection. As usual, there were the technically advanced knits the house is known for, seen in body-conscious one-shouldered tops and skirts, bodysuits, bikinis, and a red and white fit-and-flare frock that sunny Sunday dreams are made of. Nearly all the knits had geometrical patterns painstakingly woven in.\n",
      "New for Ohne Titel were the entirely fetching gauzy pleated caftan dresses, lightweight pieces in bright, summery shades, and a series of fringed bra tops, skirts, and a dress crafted from the chains of ball bearings. Off-the-shoulder viscose rompers and separates came in shades of crimson and magenta that felt fresh and easy, and easily imagined on any number of vacationing It girls, from Montauk to Ibiza. But it was a geometrically printed silk shirtdress, long, lean, and slashed at the shoulders, in a deep teal and navy combination, that felt like the biggest advance made in the pursuit of true summer style.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Olympia Le-Tan,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Olympia Le-Tan doesnt merely infuse her collections with her own personalityshe injects them with her life-experiences too. This was an autobiographically touched collage of homage to her relationship with Japan, one that Le-Tan first determined to make after hearing of the demolition of her favorite Tokyo hotel, the Okura. So, Hotel Olympia ran the cursive script on the front of her reverse souvenir jacket with a coiled rope logo to reflect her interestan aesthetic one, she emphasizedin kinbaku (Japanese bondage). \n",
      "Binding twisted at the ankle of her hyper-stylized Louboutin geta, chokered the neck of some looks, fronted Stephen Joness black mesh face masks and formed the wristlets of her signature minaudires. These featured Hello Kitty, My Melody, and Little Twin Starscuteness oclockas well as what looked like illustrations of Hokusai-as-Polaroids. The hexagon knits were hat tips to the carpet at Le-Tans lamented hotel and the red teapots a nod to Yasujir Ozus favored recurring cinematic motif. The Polaroid prints were illustrations by Le-Tans father, Pierre, of pictures taken by the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, including some of the designer. Eclectic and authentic, this collection was particularvery particularto Le-Tan herself: That should make it ultra-appealing to her followers. Fetishists and Hello Kitty obsessives will no doubt be stimulated too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Opening Ceremony,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"A fashion industry vet I know once joked that, given the reiteration of certain themes among designers, hed like the opportunity to assign fresh concepts to brands. Farm-to-table was one of the concepts he proposed. Opening Ceremony honchos Carol Lim and Humberto Leon never lack for inventive references, and this season, they came up with one pretty similar to farm-to-table all on their own. Their set, in a cavernous space on Wall Street, was a marvel to beholdabout a zillion potted plants, which will be replanted, after the show, at four schools around the city as part of the Edible Schoolyard NYC program. That worthy initiative was one expression of the new Opening Ceremony collections larger theme: Frank Lloyd Wright.\n",
      "Wright, Lim and Leon explained, had a daughter who was a modern dancer, and he often designed sets for her shows. And as an architect, he was concerned with the idea of a home as a set for livingthe place where people perform the daily rituals that, taken together, add up to a life. He was also a fan of intentional communities, self-sustaining mini utopias organized on much the same logic as that of indigenous tribes. These were all interesting paths to explore, via fashion, but the problem with this evenings OC outing was that Lim and Leon chose to explore all of them at once. The intentional community ideathat would have been a lively and timely organizing principle for a collection, but the designers diverted it into the set. The dance element came through in the inclusion of dancers, who performed seemingly spontaneous choreography, among the shows models. Mainly, the clothes dilated on the theme of home and the decorative elements that make one up. Lim and Leon are particularly eclectic in their tastes, so their riff on this reflected that sensibility, with mixed results.\n",
      "This was a difficult collection to wrap your head around. Wright-era design elements were one motif, imparted, for instance, in the prevalence of sand tones in the palette, and knit dresses and skirts with a weave like that of mid-century chairs. Architecture, in general, got a look, notably in the jumpsuits and tunics that featured inverted arch-shaped necklines. These were the collections most direct looks, and among its very best. The laid-back mood of at-home lounging was referenced in silk garments with a certain pajama mien; those that featured chinoiserie embroidery boasted surprising streetwise appeal. There were other pieces, as well, that lent a global magpie aesthetic to the proceedings. It was easy to isolate standout individual itemsthis collection was especially strong in its trouser silhouettes and its knitsbut the showing as a whole never really cohered. It left you wondering what the uniform of a Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned utopia might have been. That farm-to-table conceptits still up for grabs.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Organic by John Patrick,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"I knew this dame was trouble as soon as she walked into my office . . . . The femme fatale is a recurring trope in fashion, but its safe to say that none have looked quite like the muse of John Patricks film noirinfluenced new collection. Patrick was mostly taking his cues from the high-contrast lighting used in classics of the genre, but he also had the wit to propose that trouble, of the dame variety, neednt come in a slinky, red-lipped package. Trouble can also be fresh-faced and clad in boyish cropped trousers and a matching jacket, or a virginal shift of crisp cotton poplin, or a preppy cardigan and high-waist mini. Even the cleanest-cut girl has, at some point in her life, longed to make (or be) trouble.\n",
      "Not that Patrick avoided slinkiness entirely. In fact, this was a sexier outing than usual for him: Alongside the slouchy all-Americana staples much of a piece with previous Organic collections, there were body-hugging slip dresses in a squishy, mesh-like knit, and flirty looks in neon tulle and lace. An ankle-length T-shirt dress in that neon tulle went so far as to conjure the lurid atmosphere of the Vegas Strip. Apparently the Organic girl has a dark side, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Orla Kiely,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Its been 20 years since Orla Kielys signature leafy prints showed themselves to the world. The Irish designer marked the moment in swinging style today with a presentation of adorable clothes and accessories that revealed her secret passion: crazy golf, the sport also known as mini golf or Putt-Putt. I dont play actual golf, Kiely admitted, gesturing to the sprawling stage set that provided the backdrop for her Spring collection. But I love crazy golf. Its just so fun! And as the sun shone through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the models wasted no time in pulling up their cute, floral-patterned caddies and taking a putt.\n",
      "Kiely pulled her muted palette of coral, lime, and lilac from the poolside photographs of Slim Aarons, and the clothes conjured an uncomplicated trip to Palm Springs, California. I always love the 60s and 70s, said Kiely. And its Palm Springs that really sets the tone for that era. The silhouettes swung from pinafores and shift dresses to loose, flowing jumpsuits, all tethered to that mid-century feel. The standout moment came in the form of a chartreuse shorts suit in heavy jacquard, which made for wholly appropriate sundowner attire. Though the swans and windmills and oversize poodle (perhaps inspired by house stylist Leith Clarks much-loved pet pooch) were all well played, it was Kiely who really hit a hole in one.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Orley,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 18, 2015\",\"Whats new in a glutted knitwear market? The trio behind Orley, husband-and-wife team Matthew and Samantha Orley, and Matts brother Alex, are hard at work figuring out just that. Yarns are the bread-and-butter for the brand, and so, for its third womens offering (the first season, Fall 15, was picked up by Barneys), the designers wisely opted to emphasize their foundation in knitwear before branching out into wovens.\n",
      "Of an all-knit lineup, the team estimated 70 percent to be Italian-loomed, the rest handmade in New York, and stressed their desire to create a narrative, not just a really nice cashmere sweater. That end game was clear from the word go, with every piece of the Spring lineup speaking to a certain off-kilter, almost Tenenbaum-esque take on preppiness, from polo shirts to sweater vests (yep, sweater vests). Take a cotton-cashmere pleated skirt in a mod-looking custom graphic print. It had a splash of retro quirk to it without feeling overly precious. A pair of mulberry and tussah silk flares, though, sat firmly on this side of the 21st century and echoed the industrys current yen for head-to-toe sweater dressingso polished you could take them to the office, but so forgivingly stretchy you might just opt to wear them for SVU reruns at home, too. Things heated up in a cable-knit pullover with a surprisingly sexy back and open panels, the result of crocheting around laser-cut plastic discs. \n",
      "At a recent studio preview, Alex emphasized the importance of not just reworking their mens styles for womensix months from now the trio expect their girls business to outstrip their guys. Here was a lineup that was strong, but also single-minded enough that youd look forward to seeing how the label will diversify next season. One of the collections standouts, a crocheted shift in cherry-red and white stripes, offered a promising hint.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Oscar de la Renta,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Possibly, it seems ridiculous to begin a fashion show review with a discussion about the precisely desirable color of a carnation. Yet it is a fact that there is a vast gulf of taste between a deli-cum-gas-station pink or white type of a carnation, and the deep, deep, almost cinnamon-dark kind of a red carnation, which Oscar de la Renta picked for his daily buttonhole when he was a young man living in Madrid. But the fact that Peter Copping, Oscars successor, picked up on that color, and its resonances, is a perfect testament to his suitability for the job. He, like Oscar, has a phenomenal eye for color and social tone.\n",
      "Apparently, said Copping before the show, they used to throw red carnations into the ring after a bull fight. Which explains the presence of carnation prints in various sizes that Copping scattered on dresses, swathed skirts, and frilled blouses, and the fact that he saturated an eyelet dress in the color of Oscars favorite flower.\n",
      "Copping was partially inspired by his discovery that De la Renta had met Ava Gardner, whose lover was a bullfighter, in the 1950s. But to research the Spring collection, he had also been up to the Hispanic Society of Harlem to look at their paintings surrounding bullfightinghe took in everything from the pale blue satin of a matador suit painted by Goya, to the exact shade of baked yellow Francis Bacon used in a bullfighting scene, to the colors of peasant wool embroidery on popular Spanish postcards, said Copping. Then he let it all percolate in his imagination, and came up with a collection that thoroughly proved his own powers as a colorist, and as a designer who brings the finesse of Paris with him from all the years he worked at Louis Vuitton and Nina Ricci.\n",
      "The combination of respectfulness for the founder and pure personal flair made for a collection that succeeded in making every woman present at the show want to be part of Coppings ravishing modern view of femininity and sexuality. The sight of his models, scrubbed and groomed with matte red lipstick, their hair brushed smoothly into ponytails with low grosgrain ribbon bows, made fashions prevailing messy no-makeup grungy beauty suddenly look a whole lot less desirable at a stroke. It was not just a question of the breathtaking color choices, which ran from saturated to pastelsay, emerald green duchesse satin for a skirt suit with a narrow powder pink belt, or the grass green embroidered shoes under a mint gazar dressbut also of Coppings ability to undercut froth and frills with a modernizing casualness. He did that by putting suits with jet-embroidered flat espadrilles, by tying black ribbons nonchalantly into incredible lilac and ice-blue ball gowns, and by daring to show glimpses of naked skin through black lace. In a word, it was faultless.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Osklen,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Plenty of designers have found inspiration in the Amazon jungle, but very few have actually visited the place, let alone camped there and participated in tribal rituals. But then Oskar Metsavahta UNESCO Goodwill ambassador and former doctoris not like most designers. \n",
      "One year ago, I went to the Amazon forest and met the Ashninka tribe and was invited to their rituals, said Metsavaht. The whole collection is inspired by that experience. The narrative begins with the monochromatic blue looks in contrasting silk and suede, inspired by the ocean, and a photo-printed silk dress that referenced the designer's overhead view of the jungle as he flew in. As Metsavahts stay with the Ashninka continued, he began to incorporate the tribes element of stylethe materials and colors. Linen pieces in white or earthy taupe, some of which were tied in organic knots at the hip or waist, had an attractive rough-hewn quality. The lone red look, constructed from a latex silk blend that Metsavaht developed, was like a red feather sticking up at the back of a headdress. And the tribes characteristic face paint was incorporated, to surprisingly sophisticated effect, in the sheer looks with graphic black lines. Bags were made from fish skin, an homage to the tribe's practice of using every part of the animal. It was a clever translation of a culture that is worlds away from New York Citys hustle and bustle, and one that will be as appreciated on these American streets as well as on the beaches in Metsavahts native Brazil. Beyond the feathers and face paint, what really inspired Metsavaht was the Ashninkas respect for beauty. The meaning of aesthetics is very important for them, he said. Beauty, for them, means strength and sensualityfor man or for woman. And thats exactly what fashion is. For Metsavaht, who juggles sustainability with a luxury sensibility, the Ashninka reinforced an idea about which he is already passionate: That fashion, frivolous though it may sometimes  be portrayed, is far from meaningless.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Osman,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"I ask you for violence, in the nonsense, and you, you give me grace, your light and your warmth. Osman Yousefzada quoted a wonderful pang-of-passion Frida Kahlo love letter in his notes while references to both her art and her personal style were scattered here and there throughout this collection. The beaded tree decorations in the closing looks, some of the suiting and Stephen Joness take on Kahlos trademark headbands were among the most sharply drawn. Yet Yousefzada insisted, with a touch of weariness, that such accents were mere mood music: For me its just the same thing that I do again and again. Clothes, basically. Which I think women will want. And thats what its about. Well, yes.\n",
      "Whether women will want these clothes depends on the women. Certainly Osman has a fan base thats especially dedicated to his raved-about suite of pants. He is exploiting this happy niche not just by extending his selection of cuts, but by extending his market to the most pant-dependent constituencythis collection featured his first runway menswear, which starred notable horizontal moire corduroy jackets with a lapel shape imported from cutouts featured in his Fall womenswear collection.\n",
      "Although that beading looked fine and the silhouette was dramatic, Osmans closing yellow column dress was clearly a trial for the model to walk in. More harmonious amalgamations of theory and practice included the striking same-shade halter-neck tiered dress in waxed duchesse silk and his blown-up ikat brocade on blown-up silhouettes. The skirted three-tiered pants combined daintiness and jaunt. This collection featured a lot more flashes of grace than nonsense.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Paco Rabanne,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"Every valid fashion show has a built-in sense of its place in the world, of where the clothes fit in and where people are supposed to find it exciting and useful to wear them. Complex conceptual scenarios from deep within a designers brain can only fascinate so much if the clothes dont have any imaginable destination other than a fashion shoot or awards ceremony. So one of the subtexts running through this season is the need for fashion to readjust, widen its perspective, and stop excluding so many peoples realities.\n",
      "Smart creative minds can sketch in an environment subliminally, which is exactly what Julien Dossena was up to today at Paco Rabanne, as he ran a patched-in, mixed-up soundtrack on which the far-off noise of a live performance seemed to boom in the distance. Actually, that noise was heard at Chlo, too. And we all relate to what that means: festival sounds, the new massive social dressing-up opportunity for a generationfrom the beginning of every summer to its end.\n",
      "Dossenas collection nailed that context cleverly, merging high-tech sportiness with a sense of casual, disheveled sexiness. Bra-topped baby doll dresses, unraveling at the hems, walked alongside fitted motocross-influenced leathers, silver and khaki anoraks and parkas, track pants, and vaguely 70s sweaters printed with abstracted Native American motifs. On the feet: a practical, very cool series of suede cut-down biker-cum-Western boot-shoes ideal for coping with desert terrain, mud, and all-night dancing.  \n",
      "At the end, Dossena paid direct homage to Paco Rabannes signature space-age chain mail by showing slinky gold dresses and asymmetrical skirts roughed up around the edges with yarn chain stitching or thrown together with an army green sweater. Perfectly calibrated as potential stagewear or perhaps just for hanging out in a backstage VIP tent next summer. In the 60s, Paco Rabanne might have imagined wed all be living on the moon by 2015, but actually, this is really where weve landed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Pam & Gela,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"What do you want to wear? Thats the question that empire-builders Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor ask each other at the outset of their design process each season. Then they take a look at what Nash-Taylors daughter is currently wearing, and from that informal poll, they conjure a collection.\n",
      "This season, the duos proposition erred toward the hippie-ish, with asymmetrical knit dresses and skirts and slouchy graphic tees providing the contemporary counterpoint to such Easy Riderera staples as fringed suede jackets, embroidered peasant blouses, and studded leather miniskirts. There were other updates, toothe patchwork flares, for instance, were of trompe loeil denim-dyed French terry, and the frequently deployed camel-colored suede found its way into sporty items such as track pants.\n",
      "The designers want their casual clothes to wear like basics, but not look like them, and with that in mind, they embellished tees and sweaters with knot details and fringe, and finished numerous pieces with a mottled wash that added to the collections overarching vintage sensibility. The Pam & Gela clothes are flying out the door at the stores where theyre soldapparently, when Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor ask each other what they want to wear, they furnish an answer many young women agree with.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Pamella Roland,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Todays Pamella Roland affair was the inaugural fashion show to be staged at the Whitney Museum of American Arts new Meatpacking digs. If its somewhat surprising that that particular honor didnt go to an artsier designer, it should be noted that Roland does sit on the museums board and has been passionately involved in the new space since its earliest days. What, then, would a label that is fluent in mermaid dresses and marked by a kind of princess-y exuberance when it comes to full-throttle glamour offer up for a turn at this bastion of the avant-garde? As the designer put it backstage, You cant show in a museum and not do art. \n",
      "Roland was especially interested in the work of Frank Stella, known for his large-scale geometric paintings in Technicolor palettes (a major retrospective bows at the Whitney in late October). She evoked that oeuvre in subtle ways. Some of her nicest propositions came through in a series of silk gowns whose fronts were folded up, origami-style, to expose the fabrics brilliantly hued undersides. Liquid organza was surprisingly techy in a floor-grazing blush number, but the huge floppy bow it appeared as on a column gown fell a little flat.\n",
      "Rolands real successes here were the ones in which Stellas spirit seemed to guide her most: the punchy and relatively spare pieces (though it was hard to deny that a wild-card crystal-encrusted jumpsuit would look pretty great on Mary J. Blige, who sat front-row). The more precious items, like a strapless, bubble-hemmed minidress in sea-foam with white roses, or a jewel-trimmed, 50s-feeling evening coat, seemed to run counter to both the designers message and the venue.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Parsons MFA,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"No fewer than 11 graduates of Parsons School of Designs esteemed MFA program (Fashion Design and Society), which is touted as the first in the nation of its kind, both conceptual and skills based, showcased their thesis collections today. They were Katherine Mavridis, Liya Liu, Long Xu, Mayako Kano, Diletta Cancellato, Pengji Cai, Ryohei Kawanishi, Shih Hsun Lee, Sisi Liu, Tianfang Jing, and Varpu VernaHel Rapeli. If their collective output is anything to go by, the future of fashion will be a studiously creative place.\n",
      "Four of the students were on hand to discuss their work and used pitch-perfect industry parlance in doing so. Mavridis, from Australia, described her technique of weaving tightly coiled tubes into enormous shapes that hardly need a human body to fill them out. New Zealander Kano spoke of the delicacy of Meiji-period Japanese photographs, in particular the now-faded pigments used for preservation, to explain her lacy confections. Hailing from China, Liya Liu said New York Citys mountains of street garbage waiting for pick up inspired the nylon trash bags of her collection, almost none of which were actually sewn, as did the enormous amount of waste that goes on in the garment trade. And, most irreverent of all, Kawanishi looked to Dadaism to create the mundane, quotidian, stupid serious objects on his runway, ranging from a bath mat and a toilet paper dispenser to closet hangers and FedEx envelopes.\n",
      "Other strong showings came from Xu, who used a bamboo-weaving technique from his native China to craft his intricate multicolored pieces; Hsun Lee, the only mens designer this year, who combined  traditional mens tailoring and skateboard gear; Sisi Liu, who enlarged the ornamental flowers of her box-making hobby into large-scale 3-D versions; and Jing, also from China, who made her ethereal collection by printing folded paper with translucent film.\n",
      "In addition to the schools revered course director, Shelley Fox, Parsonss new dean of fashionand expert in sustainabilityBurak Cakmak was also on hand. One of the most important things we teach is that students should have fun, he said. We allow them to choose their own guiding principles. Cakmak replaces Simon Collins, Parsonss outgoing dean who was very visibly reveling in the fun his final students were having.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Paul & Joe,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Paul & Joe sent out a metallic pink embossed postcard as the invitation for its Spring show, but it may as well have been fronted with a photo of Miami. Thats where founder Sophie Mechaly mined references for a collection that was fun, frisky, and swathed in palm fronds. More precisely, she said she drew from Scarface and Magnum, P.I. to arrive at key looks such as the halter maxi dresses and slim, pastel pantsuits.\n",
      "Just as there will always be flora and fauna prints in a Paul & Joe collection, so too will there be modified denim, sweet flourishes (broderie anglaises, ruffle accents), and a boyish wink (shirts or shoes); the difference each season comes from how Mechaly doses them. The Miami throwback allowed for a new twist: retro jogging attire remixed as silk blousons and shorts or hybridized as a studded tuxedo pant. The theme also meant she could go gutsy on glitz, from the silver leather trousers to the sequined baby doll and the metallic boots. Just in case those pieces didnt sufficiently incite the spirits, she added a vintage-style T-shirt with the line Go for it. Mechaly was already wearing it, like a souvenir from the show.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Paul Smith,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Paul Smith and his wife, Pauline Denyer Smith, were once couture show regulars and to this day one of Paulines prize possessions is the last Smoking ever made by Yves Saint Laurent. Preshow this afternoon, Sir Paul said, When you hold that suit, the weight is amazingit gives this lovely drape. Drape was one of the key preoccupations of this collection, which, while obviously not produced on a couture level, managed to force its fabrics elegantly to assert their designers will against the implacable tug of gravity. Thus, the first dressa silk-screened mlange of orange on two clashing patternssignaled the turned-up volume, Sir Paulstyle, of many of the looks that followed. The colors were drawn from David Hockney, while the disjunctive block shapes of the printed panels looked to be mined from Henri Matisse, appropriate enough for a show held at the Serpentine Galleries.\n",
      "Smith makes a masterful pant and is especially sensitive to the subtleties of the break. Todays finest broke lavishly on a pair that came wide-legged and pin-tucked in gray wool, worn under a matching jacket with a lean lapel that featured six mysteriously nonfunctional buttons. Elsewhere, a short-sleeved, asymmetrically hemmed jacket challenged the masculine codes from which it was drawn. The croc cross straps on colorful rubber-clad platforms echoed the built-in cross-body suspenders that recurred throughout the collection, while the houses newly boosted accessories team delivered some harmonious harmonica handbags and a tote so ingeniously colored that it seemed to be its own light source.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Paule Ka,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"In June, one year after the departure of founder Serge Cajfinger, Paule Ka named a new creative designer, Alithia Spuri-Zampetti. The 31-year-old Central Saint Martins grad comes directly from a six-year stint at Lanvin where, most recently, she was the head designer of womenswear. Market categories notwithstanding, the leap in sensibility between the two brands isnt a huge one; her background is probably very appealing for Paule Ka, which occupies an untapped nichecall it accessible elegancebut lacks the cachet.\n",
      "Spuri-Zampettis influence, however, will not be noticeable until next season, which means the current collection represents a studio-designed placeholder. And given the flux, it came across as sure and steady. Beyond the brands standby trapeze dress, there were several other day-to-night variations, each distinguished by some combination of polished fabric (crisp faille, fluid cloque, cotton tricotine) or punchy color (hibiscus, sky blue, citron). Everydayand every nightnovelty seemed to be the through line, from pastel brocade outerwear to a loosely interpreted tuxedo-style strapless dress. Bonus points if you identified the puzzle-piece pattern as M.C. Escher; applied here and there to skirts, dresses, and knits, it took a stronger stance than standard houndstooth. But the strongest design of all was a flattering sheath, slit from below the knee up each leg and fronted with a sculptural knot. On the hanger, it seemed sleek enough; on the body, it had a magic effect.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Peter Jensen,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"The Martini-drinking Los Angeles stylist Shirley Kurata was the driving force behind Peter Jensens Spring 2016 show today. Jensen marked his 16th year in fashion and a return to the official London schedule with a no-holds-barred homage to Kuratas Pop Art sensibility. Inspiration certainly struck from close quarters this season. The eclectic stylist, who has recently been responsible for the red carpet reinvention of Lena Dunham, has worked on Jensens shows for some five years, after the pair hit it off at Vogues Fashions Night Out in New York City. \n",
      "Jensens enduring affection for a 60s silhouette held fast this season. It was embodied here in a mod secretary look that meshed with what he explained as a vintage 80s vibe. This came through first and foremost in the fabricationwith cream skirt suits and shift dresses in toweling (a throwback to the designers time living in Hollywood, that motherland of the velour tracksuit), but also in the cacti-stitched polo shirts. The seasonless standouts were the pretty camera-print dresses worn over shirtingand the heavily sequined white socks and visors that finished every look. Jensen took the idea of the muse to its outer reaches both with the sweater that read Shirley, Shirley, Shirley and the step-and-repeat print comprised of hundreds of faceless Shirleys. This homage to the Tinseltown stylist was always going to have an emphasis on fun.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Peter Pilotto,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Heres a query about long, flared culottes. Granted, they are being worn around the streets this season in their tailored form, but will they have legs next season in lemon or pale blue semi-sheer seersucker? Peter Pilotto took a gamble on them for Spring, and on the evidence he provided the answer is: Unlikely.\n",
      "For the past few seasons Pilotto has been carefully orienting his collections in a way that moves him away from being defined as a print designer. In this one, he decided to concentrate mainly on solid colors and diaphanous textures.The signature prints he made his name with were de-emphasized and reduced to graphic lines stamped with black on white circles and triangles that ran along segmented skirts.\n",
      "The stronger part of Pilottos vision for Spring lay in his reprise of the midi-skirted silhouette he innovated a while back, at a point when no-one else was thinking about that gracefully attenuated line. That proved prescient, and the continuation of that line, which today appeared with tailored sleeveless wrap-over jackets, worked to his advantage, as did the dresses and skirts, cut in pale layers of diaphanous lace. Along the way, Pilotto also picked up on some of the themes which are swirling in the fashion ether: drawstring details, tiered flounces, and asymmetrical frills. On the rack in stores, all of those things will no doubt have appeal as high summer fare. But do they stand out as recognizably Peter Pilotto? Thats debatable. Every young designer deserves the chance to develop, but sometimes customers are reluctant to let go of what they found compelling about a label in the first place.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Phelan,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Get ready to hear a lot more about Phelan: The new label by former Alexander Wang knitwear designer Amanda Phelan launched this afternoon with a bang. The show, seated theater style, was led off by an extraordinary four-woman performance choreographed by Vim Vigor Dance Company founder Shannon Gillen, and it concluded with the assembly, onstage, of models clad in some of the most innovative looks to come from a young New York designer in quite some time. The rapturous applause was earned.\n",
      "The dance wasnt just for show. As Phelan explained, movement is key to her brands identity, and she wanted every element of her first collection, and its presentation, to speak to that theme. Its plainest expression was via the knits, which displayed a staggering level of technical invention: There were knits popcorned and puckered, ones gossamer sheer, and others patterned in graphic intarsia. The jaw-dropper was an accordion-knit silver dress that came off armor-like from a distance, but was revealed to be pliable and lightweight when studied close-up. Phelan was clearly stretching her knitwear muscles here, but she spent the wealth of her Wang experience in another way, too: Aside from a few longeurs, these were street-ready, commercial looks.\n",
      "Phelans movement theme also extended to the woven pieces. It was evident in an abstract brushstroke print, and in here-and-there fringe embellishment. A long cotton skirt was slit up the front to accommodate a long stride, and the blinding metallic pieces captured motion through light. Phelan made and remade the same point, but the sheer variety of ways she found to tell the same story kept the storytelling from feeling heavy-handed. If anything, the quibble here was that the looks the dancers wore, also by Phelan, werent included in the official runway collection. The dancers high-waisted, wide-leg cropped trousers demonstrated movement in the best way possiblethrough the furious aliveness of bodies.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Philipp Plein,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"As hundreds of hands simultaneously lifted their personal screens to ensure by-proxy digestion of the sight in front of their eyesCourtney Love in ripped jeans sliding down a mechanical runway singing to the backing of two glow-eyed Terminator-touched robot guitaristsit was easy to see Philipp Pleins point. In his bare backstage office before this show, wired on Red Bull and super-stressed in the expectation of imminent catastrophe, he had observed: Our life today is dominated by machines and electronic gadgets. Like your phone is dominating your life and your navigation system is helping you to go from A to B. Without our gadgets it is really hard these days for us to survive. Which is true: When that show started there were very few people in the audienceand certainly not mewho werent holding up their machines to prove their presence in the room.\n",
      "Plein had decided to throw this Orwellian showthink Metropolis meets prt--porter meets Alexander McQueen Spring 99after watching the Alex Garlandscripted and directed film Ex Machina on a flight back to Italy from his second home in Los Angeles. The idea he had was to use robots to equip the models as they proceeded on conveyer belts down the catwalk. In stop-starts they moved forward, as if on an assembly line, and the industrial machines handed them their accessoriessunglasses, handbags, and the rest. It was a show to chill the hearts of stylists everywhere. \n",
      "Yet when we met backstage, Plein had just learned that two weeks of programming had crashed and the robots werent working. He was kvetching hard-core. Luckily some adroit IT specialistperhaps  someone turned the robots off then on againmeant that by showtime (only 52 minutes late) all was as planned. Love bloomed forth, sang her song, and afterward the models made their chillingly passive progress down the runway.\n",
      "The collection (oh yes!) was an extension of the punk theme that Plein had plucked from the ether for his most recent menswear collection. He is a pop designer and the clothes are pop too. Many in fashion dismiss them as schlock, but there is design behind these clothes apparent paucity of it. Patched with fake album cover art and slogan badges and very often machine gunned with studs, these were as maximalist-ly expressed as his theme. They were obviouswhich is Pleins whole in-your-face MO. \n",
      "Not long afterward, I found Love. She was settling into her chair at the post-show dinner. Asked if it was challenging to perform with robots, she said: Well, I rehearsed just once and it was quite scary. But actually, the robots were very well behaved. It was sliding down on the conveyorI had to rehearse that a few times. And was that her most bananas fashion show experience ever? No. But its up there.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Lorenzo Serafini established himself as a dress man at his Philosophy debut for Fall 15. His second runway collection was very much an evolution of his first: Victoriana by way of the 70s, with a hint of the undone prairie girl. Erdem Moralioglu covered similar ground in London, but where his frocks had a special occasion sense of hauteur, Serafinis dresses are designed to be lived in. Wisps of floral-printed chiffon with tiny buttons left undone over lacy bits of lingerie paraded down the runway on glossy black cowboy booties, beguiling in their offhandedness. \n",
      "David Hamiltons photography was on Serafinis mood board, and like the famous lensman, this designer idealizes the young. A cropped crocheted sweater worn with hip-slung chambray trousers exposed acres of midriff; broderie anglaise bloomers did the same for upper thighs. Those shorts might get an airing at Fashion Week a year from now, but otherwise theyre a nonstarter. Elsewhere a cowhide leather coat seemed like a too-obvious nod to Serafinis Western theme. As he settles into his new role, hell learn to avoid that kind of runway pratfall. Serafinis promise lies in his easy way with a silk dress, from a pale mint drop-waist style to the lace inset slips and nightshirts with shorter-in-front and longer-in-back hems that ended the show. Extrapolate on numbers like that and keep at the crafty knits he paired with them, and hell be onto something.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Phoebe English,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Brava, Phoebe English. At her presentation today, the up-and-coming designer began in earnest to deliver on her tremendous potential. This was Englishs most fully fleshed-out collection to date, filled with varied wearable pieces that expressed her distinctively dreamy point of view. Displacement was the theme here, imparted in everything from the askew cut of a simple camisole to the stutter effect of the three-layered pieces of fabric on the front of a flax-canvas sleeveless jacket. English often talks about wanting her clothes to have a sense of immediacy, a feeling she conveys via techniques that can come off as naive. That sleeveless jacket, though, was one of the garments here that betrayed her sophistication as a designer: The jacket was tailored through the back, and the topmost piece of fabric layered in the front had a nattily finished blazer pocket. Lots of designers play with deconstruction; English was genuinely deconstructing.\n",
      "Details like that jacket pocket werent the first things that jumped out at you about Englishs new clothes. There was, of course, the signature handfuls of tulle that English applied to create her gauzy effects; there were also sui generis embellishments, like the rope-draped velvet frills that looked, not unappealingly, like scrunchies. And English introduced some intriguing new textures here, such as string embroidery and a material made by re-weaving torn-up strands of silk. The re-woven silk pieces were a highlight of the collectionthe fabric itself was beautiful, and English added to its expressiveness by leaving the ends of the silk ribbon dangling to create an irregular fringe.\n",
      "The real development here, though, was in the collections accessibility. Another highlight of this outing were the matter-of-fact culottes, slashed on both legs near the hem. The gesture of the slash sufficed to announce Englishs presence in the garment, but you could easily imagine it as a mix-and-match go-to piece in a cool girls closet. Ditto the slip-like silk skirts, and those nicely askew camisoles. English has gone a long way this season toward figuring out how to diffuse her voice through the kinds of items that make a wardrobe. Expect more and better to come: Thats not a lesson designers unlearn.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Piazza Sempione,Tiziana Cardini,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"For the launch of Piazza Sempiones Spring collection, the label again embraced a collaboration with the art world, tapping R di Martino, a talented Italian video artist whose emotional yet elegant visual language has been widely acclaimed. She was commissioned to make a short film, called A Day of Wonder, shot in Marrakech and inspired by the cult movie Cat People, a 1942 film noir depicting an exotic atmosphere full of danger and mystery.\n",
      "Di Martino captured the sensuality of a lush Moroccan walled garden, where a beautiful woman was lounging poolside. Obviously she was clad in a Piazza Sempione cotton kaftanwhich she ditched pronto when, after fluctuating lazily between dreams and reality and upon hearing a terrifying roar, she jumped hurriedly into the pool for safety. There she was surrounded by a surreal play of lights reflected on the water like a deceitful net. The finale revealed the illusory nature of her fearsas well as the Moroccan inspiration of a collection which, in an abundant stream ofreferences, also mentioned a novel by the Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun.\n",
      "Ideas from North African garb were translated into clean lines and comfortable shapes in a lineup where tunics, capes and elongated dresses had an easy, casual feel, yet were elegant in their fluid simplicity. Colors were warm and natural; micro geometric patterns were inspired by zelliges, the traditional colorful tiles adorning the walls of mosques and palaces. They also served as the starting point for the digital work of artist Najia Mehadji, whose pulsating images of flowers were reworked on printed silk, poplin, and duchesse.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Polo Ralph Lauren,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Everyone says that the fashion business is changing. For this reporters money, the best evidence of the week so far came at Polo Ralph Laurens rooftop presentation, where Selena Gomez (43.5 million Instagram followers) and Brooklyn Beckham (4.2 millionnot bad for a celebrity offspring) took in the tableaux vivant side by side. Considering the access to all the eyeballs that millennial celebrities can provide a brand, a journalist cant help but wonder if her kinds days are numbered. \n",
      "While I still have your attention, a thought on the company and its new Spring collection: Nobody knows their own brand better than Ralph Lauren knows his. One season fashion leans minimal, the next it sways vintage nerd-chic, but Polos all-American style is eternal. Exiting the stairwell into the bright sunshine of The McKittrick Hotels Gallow Green, Gomez and Beckham were greeted by a denim grouping which produced two of the afternoons strongest looks: a faded jumpsuit with metal hardware that was as slouchy as a three-piece denim suit was slim. Section two had a Western flavor. Fringe may be absolutely everywhere at the moment, but let the record stand, Lauren got there first. \n",
      "Group three is where Lauren turned on the brights, tying the sleeves of a fuchsia cable-knit crew around the shoulders of a coral red minidress, layering an electric orange schoolgirl blazer over a Bengal-stripe shirtdress, and reuniting that definitive preppy combination of pink and green on a linen blazer and skinny jeans. Floral-print sundresses were accessorized with floral-print bags of many different shapes and sizes. By comparison, the guys khaki suiting came off staid. Classic isnt a bad thing when it comes to menswear, but for the preppy peacock, Lauren had a vibrant red firemans jacket.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ports 1961,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Natasa Cagalj is a designer who believes in allowing her experiences as a woman, a mother, and a friend to other women to inform the way she designs. The ideas for the collection she put together for Spring started, she relatedwhile pulling out an oversize poplin top, printed with circles and flowerswhen she was on the beach in Croatia this summer. These are the simple potato prints my children made on holiday, she said. Im half Croatian, half Slovenian, and used to spend four weeks on the beach every year in Croatia as a girlI always used to bring ribbons and tape and paper and paints with me to make things, just to stop myself being bored. She smiled. So now its a family tradition that me and my sister and all our children always do the same thing every year.\n",
      "The sense of a lifestyle, craftiness, and do-it-yourself resourcefulness ran through the collection, which was based around building a wardrobe of pinstriped shirting pieces, pants, knitwear, soft tailoring, and dresses. Cagalj, whose studio is in London, says shed like to take the stress out of dressing for busy women who have work, family, and business travel to contend with. I had this thought of how nice it would be to go to bed in your hotel room in your pajamas and bathrobe and maybe just get up and go out in them! How many fashion women in a zombie state of tiredness at the shows will relate to that?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Prabal Gurung,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"When a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 of this year, Kathmandu-raised Prabal Gurung mobilized quickly, using his social media platforms to call for donations. Since then, about a million dollars have been raised for the quakes victims by the Shikshya Foundation Nepal, on the board of which he sits. Backstage tonight he was feeling gratitude. If it wasnt for the fashion industry, I wouldnt have been able to do it. His show started with a thank-you: some 30 monks clad in their traditional red and yellow robes, hands clasped in prayer, chanting.\n",
      "The collection, too, had its roots in Nepal. The work of artist Laxman Shreshtha, who Gurung said he grew up studying, became a jacquard on skin-baring evening separates, the orange and yellow Holi powder hues of which formed the shows warm, lit-from-within palette. Last season Gurung took a turn for the minimal, and he was on a similar path for Spring. Simple pieces like a bias-cut chiffon column in pale yellow or a sleeveless black-and-white guipure lace sheath were the ones that resonated. Gurung has a tendency to overembellish from time to timea printed dress with a skin-baring hand-tacked seam at the waist, and another dress with a cluster of cutouts below its plunging neckline were two looks that wouldve benefited from a little more restraint. By the end, however, he was in his groove. The trio of body-skimming, brightly colored finale gowns were stripped of all the extras. They looked sensational.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Prada,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 24, 2015\",\"Subverting traditional classics: That was the line transmitted about the Prada collection by design director Fabio Zambernardi backstage in the absence of Miuccia Prada, who was sadly unable to be there this season due to the passing of her aunt. If Miuccia was elsewhere, her aesthetic was fully present in a collection which literally stayed within narrow lines. It was an essay on skirt suits and coats, bisected with a graphic theme of vertical stripes, and accompanied by a wealth of her quirky accessories, signature embellishments and the swish of dozens of dangly earrings as big as Christmas-tree baubles.\n",
      "The news from Milan so far has been about retro-eclecticism drawn through an Italian sensibility. Well, if anyone is the mother of all that, it's Miuccia Prada, who has been writing the encyclopedia on it, with PhD-level footnotes and wittily allusive fashion-changing asides, for decades. This collection trod firmly on her home territory, shod in an array of elegant low-heeled shoes, each pair made in its own delicious configuration of pointiness, ankle-strapping, metallic leather, patent and suede.\n",
      "As for the suits, they came in collages of checks, tweeds, and stripes, sometimes in leather and suede, here and there in transparent prints. What to make of this? For one thing, Miuccia Prada pays no heed to weather-appropriateness. In her viewwhich is a global onetheres as much need for pieced fur coats in summer as there is for skimpy silk slip dresses, which she optionally layers over chunky knits. Theres the question of proportions, tooher loosened shoulder line and boxy shapes, and a series of waist-length jackets in brown suede and leather, could well prove influential.\n",
      "The show ended with a siren call to Pradas wealthiest constituencies: coats in metallic snakeskin and suede stripes, and beautifully desirable organza suits and coats decorated with outsize transparent pailletted flowers. One way or another, all those looks are destined to be broken down and distributed as trophies all over the realms of young Hollywood, the art world, weddings, and special occasions that Miuccia Prada knows so well.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Preen by Thornton Bregazzi,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Forecast: Next summer will be about prettiness, romance, ruffles, and laceor at least it will be for the portion of female humanity whos naturally into that. But what if youre not? Preen by Thornton Bregazzi is a collection that might meet you halfway: Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi are a couple who know how to put an English edge on a ruffle and a flash of sex in a fluttery print frock.\n",
      "Not surprising: Theyre based in Notting Hill and started their business in the 90s in a concrete bunker under the overpass on Portobello Road. Versed in the history of subversive alternatives as they are, they can easily turn their hands to punk-ifying a Princess Diana Shy Di blouse with a couple of D-rings and straps, or making that whole yoke and frill shape in startlingly erotic sheer black lace.\n",
      "Thornton and Bregazzi said theyd been looking at contemporary dance, particularly at Michael Clark, and wanted a sense of beautiful romance in the collection. The opening dress, a dusty pink with sprigged flowers and a falling-off-shoulder line, captured that fluidity of movement in a Stevie Nicks sort of waya trend thats continuing since the New York shows. Then came a lot of slim lace dresses, layered over short skirts, which had cutout patches on the sleeves that had been re-appliqud with guipure flowers. If they slightly trod on territory Christopher Kane mapped out at the beginning of his career, and other moments brought back memories of some of Nicolas Ghesquires Balenciaga collections, thats only a quibble. Otherwise, it was, as always, a confident showing of what their audience likes best.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Preen Line,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"A Georgian townhouse on Fitzroy Square was the serene setting for the first showing of Preen Lines Spring 2016 collection. It was a chance for the designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi to indulge their magpie spirit with a series of vintage-inspired pieces that had their frequent stomping ground, Portobello Market, at heart.\n",
      "Rainbows and flowers in satin stitch embroidery, with more than a hint of the Haight-Ashbury hippie, nodded to the 70s needlework of Ossie Clark. It crept across the sleeves of a white double pleat denim jacket, and onto a series of seriously desirable two-tone suede pieces that included a belted shirtdress and button-front A-line skirt. Preen-staple floaty dresses were amplified with acidic yellow and pink checks on chiffon and stretch drill fabrics that hit a hard-edged, punky note. Once again, the joy of Preen Line was in its ability to pull elements from countercultures and transform them into the kind of everyday essentials that smart, hardworking woman want and need. There was much for them to choose from in this sprawling 70-piece collection, which overall was an altogether softer proposition than Fall, though the graphic stripes that featured so heavily that season also found their way onto cropped sweatshirts and monochrome tank tops here. A standout was the zigzag sweater, which injected some much-needed West London glam into this quiet corner of Bloomsbury.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Pringle of Scotland,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Although Massimo Nicosias press notes quoted him as saying this collection reflects an ethereal holiday in Scotland, it would be highly inadvisable to pack these clothes for a real vacation in Braveheart territory. Because, seriously: If you didn't freeze to death, the midges would eat you alive. That trifling quibble apart, this was an often-lovely, highly shootable potpourri of technically impressive work. Nicosia is a percolator, a thinker, and this season he was trying to step back behind Pringle of Scotland's thick-knit lambswool curtain into more elemental territory. The deep-V punched argyle intarsia in the debut look pointed to the rustication and sublimation ahead. Rubberized string and leather tape were the fronds that twined below faux-naif floral details pinned to the chest and hip of faux-crochet (faux-chet?) loose woven dresses. Sliced panels of silk in diamond formation were more argyle salutations, whilst the fishing-net open stitching was Nicosia's nod to the installation pieces of artist Ernesto Neto. All this carefully wrought, through-a-prism primitivism worked pragmatically in the net bags and stitched sandals. To further entangle this collection's complicatedly knotted self-referential pitch at distillation, that orange stitching was in fact digitally printeda computer-realized simulacrum of an artisan technique.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Proenza Schouler,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"The things you hear backstage. Tonight at Proenza Schouler, Lazaro Hernandez declared, We were looking at bananas, things that peel away from the body. The designer and his partner, Jack McCollough, turned out an audacious collection for Spring, one that solidified their recent preoccupations with texture, decoration, and asymmetry, and produced some of the most knockout dresses of the week.\n",
      "Spain seemed to be a starting point, what with the black, white, and red color palette; the ruffles and the exposed shoulders; and the pom-poms that traced the edges of dresses and jackets in broderie anglaise. But this wasnt the straightforward interpretation of Spanish influences that Peter Coppings was at Oscar de la Renta last night. Two shirtdresses that spilled off the shoulders (fashions current favorite erogenous zone) turned to reveal a crisscross of straps; the hem of another dress was connected via a series of tied knots, and the back was cut out of a knit dress with flamenco ruffles. Tailored pieces were stripped of their closures; velvet ribbons that looped through metal grommets and tied in bows kept patch-worked jacquard jackets and vests from falling open. All of which brings us back to Hernandezs peeling bananas.\n",
      "The Proenza boys have long been New York Citys most craft-obsessed young designers. With a new investor announced earlier this year, their ambitions are bigger than ever. Here and there the details were overdoneseen all together, those bows surely looked too busy. But when they were on, they were on. Tops in our books was a series of narrow midi dresses with ruffles, cutouts, and fil coupe dots. Feathered numbers made by shooting a rod through each quill to create a mesh grid were truly special. As for accessories, the pointy-toed mules with metal ring detailing, lacing at the ankles, and low mirrored heels rank right up there with the best of New York City, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Protagonist,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Creative director Kate Wendelborn may have recently left Protagonist, but Spring found the hyper-soign label born of The Line in fighting form, albeit with a slightly more conservative tenor. The studio team hewed close to its aesthetic foundations; clean lines, immaculate fabrications, and unfussy luxury. The latter was paramount for Spring straight out of the gate: to wit, a spare robe coat in buttery suede andwait for ita chocolate croc bolero. A piece like that might easily feel anachronistic, downright patrician even, but in the closet of the Protagonist woman (sitting as it no doubt does alongside tattered 501s and white tees) it reads as a serious statement. Itll team dreamily with one of this seasons lookbook shoe stylesBirks  la Blahnik good enough to make you pray theyll make it into production. Their androgynous appeal was echoed in rakish pajama tops, which borrowed a classic mens shape and added a simple tie to cinch the waist. \n",
      "A grouping of straightforward black nylon jackets came up strong on utilitarianism; still, theyd hardly have been missed within this generally singular lineup. Shirting, an emphasis for the brand from day one, was as covetable as ever, with pieces alternately crisp and louche with wide cuffs, or with shawl collars and delicate button detailing. Those closures were equally effective on a slit-to-there pencil skirt, which was risqu without being showy, and evocative to boot.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Public School,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"The pressures on for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne. The Public School designers unveil their debut collection for DKNY in a few days time, and it was reasonable to expect that the duos need to deliver for their new corporate masters would result in a Public School show that looked, well, distracted. Instead, Chow and Osbornes DKNY assignment seems to have prompted them to think even harder about Public School, and how to bring the brands clothes a real sense of elevation.\n",
      "A sophisticated tone was set with the first pair of looks, two streetwise yet soign ensembles that featured terrific, softly pleated palazzo pants. Here, at last, was the payoff for all the effort Chow and Osborne have put in the past few seasons to bring more dimension and fluidity to their womens looks. And indeed, the highlights of this collection found them exploring dimension and fluidity with a fresh sense of fluency. Those qualities were there in spades in, for instance, a chic belted gilet of sand-toned raffia, multiple parachute-inspired coats, and the silky maxi dresses that read as a sporty take on that lean Haider Ackermann silhouette. The latter looks didnt read as derivative. They did, however, feel grown up.\n",
      "Chow and Osborne said after the show that they were imagining the Public School girl gone abroad, on far-flung travels seeking to find herself. Thats a grab bag of a concept, one that invites a lot of drift, and where Chow and Osborne faltered here was in the looks that digressed from the collections overarching urban-nomad vibe. A tennis sweateresque knit dress, for instance, seemed out of sync with the rest of the show; ditto the sculpted wrap skirts and button-downs with graphic contrast piping. The designers werent wrong to want to interrupt the parade of diaphanous looks with something a little sharper, but they did that to better effect when they introduced, say, slender ribbed tunics with tonal horizontal stripes. Those pieces expressed the signature Public School geometry, but elegantly and with understatement. If thats what comes of turning up the pressure on Osborne and Chowbring it on.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rachel Antonoff,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Was a new Wes Anderson flick filming at The Plaza Hotel this morning? No, it was just that Rachel Antonoff had taken over The Plazas storied Palm Court to stage her labels fantastical Spring presentation. A branch structure encircled the rooms central bar, and the plush carpets were strewn with torn paper, pinecones, Coleman lamps, and the like. All around were exquisite 3-D paper birds.\n",
      "With a theme of birding, Antonoff envisioned the seasons protagonist, Edith Finch, a slightly dotty (if not downright deranged) woman. We dont know if its all in her head, Antonoff offered. She might be the only person at camp. There was also a dose of Troop Beverly Hills. The set was an ultra-involved imagining of what the Womens Aviary Society Annual Birding Weekend might look like. In keeping with the quietly sinister undertone, models posed casually with, say, an ax (more Misery than Troop BH) or a bow and arrow. Whats more, one of those paper birds came shot, bleeding tiny crimson paper droplets.\n",
      "There were sweet, Carmen Mirandaesque fruit prints; itty-bitty cropped novelty T-shirts (Tiny Tee, read a particularly meta one); and 50s-style frocks. The camp/birding themes hit their zenith in the counselor get-upskhaki colored with all manner of ornithological flair. The chickadee patches were darling, but there was an authoritarian dowdiness to those pieces that may make them a tough sell for Antonoffs clientele. What theyll go gaga for is the pure 90s slip dress in a candy-colored pastel floral jacquard and the eyelet column gown.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rachel Comey,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"This was a watershed moment. Tonights Rachel Comey dinner-cum-show at Pioneer Works in Red Hook unfolded a little differently than ones past: As opposed to filing out in a series of looks between courses, Comeys models came out once this evening, en masse. And most of them werent models, at least not in the sense that the term is usually understood. These were dancers of varying ages, colors, and sizes, from the robbinschilds company, with which Comey collaborated on a video presentation for Resort. They were fitted in characteristically easy-going looks that suited each womans shape, and as they took their leisurely turns down the ersatz runway between the dinner tables, they asserted an aura of self-possession and authority. The dancers looked like interesting, stylish women you might encounter on the street. That was Comeys point, of courseto validate the reality of her clothes, rather than setting them up as a fantasy that potential customers might wish to enter into. Many people in the audience said afterwards that they were moved.\n",
      "It seems a bit glib, after that coup de thetre, to talk about individual pieces. But Comeys collection did underscore her themethe emphasis was on fabrics that felt soft and looked lived in; experienced somehow. To wit, the stonewashed velvet that Comey used in slouchy suits and one excellent, duster-length trench, and the vegetable-dyed leathers and emphatically distressed denim. A sense of things being in process pervaded the collections shapes, as well: These were fitted closer to the body, in general, than Comey is usually wont to do, but they frequently featured dangling scarf-like hems or other kinds of asymmetries to create dimension and dynamism. There were standout pieces, alongside that velvet trench, and sundry details worth calling out, but they all served Comeys larger point, which was to validate the fact that these clothes were made for living. Which is a thing that real, interesting women do.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rachel Zoe,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"After a turning point for Rachel Zoes eponymous line back in Resort, you hoped the designer and her team would be able to keep up their momentum in reviving the formerly fatigued label. And at yesterday's presentation, they generally succeeded.\n",
      "At the risk of sounding like a broken record in characterizing the mega-stylists design sensibilities, her woman doesnt vary too much from season to season, even if the locale does periodically (Morocco, or Carnaby Street): gypset luxe, with a Bianca Jaggeresque ratio of uptown polish and downtown bohemia.\n",
      "Zoes clothes continue to take on a more aspirational quality. Spring's tasseled suede topper felt a long way from the parade of filmy pussy-bow blouses from seasons gone by. There was a sense of luxury to it, and to pieces like a beaded and fringed vest in cream-color upholstery, or the tasseled suede toppers. The designers suiting, meanwhile, was more compelling than ever before: Opulently slouchy pajama styles stole even the heart of this Fashion Weekweary reporter.\n",
      "A few looks felt superfluous; the diaphanous yellow maxi dress was surely nice and shoppable, but perhaps not distinctive enough to warrant its place in the runway edit. Nevertheless, this collection was another savvy step in the reinvigoration of the Rachel Zoe brand.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rag & Bone,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Did it make any difference that Rag & Bone decided to show in Brooklyn? Not in the sense of having any material effect on the pictures you see here, in which the background and lighting are indistinguishable from any other professional production in New York. Yet theres a yearning among many designers now to get back to some feeling of authenticityor rather, any feeling at all that takes people out of the usual show rut. And in the case of Rag & Bone designers David Neville and Marcus Wainwright, that meant deciding to invite their audience to partake of something privately meaningful to them on both the local and the stylistic levels: to wit, a collection that re-channeled the 90s of the designers youth, and in a community arts center, St. Anns Warehouse, which they both revere as a stage graced by Lou Reed and other members of the Velvet Underground generation.\n",
      "A swift read out in terms of clothes revealed slightly different reference points, though. Backstage, Wainwright said that the midi tube dresses and hoop earrings were derived from his memories of going to the Notting Hill Carnival in London in the late 90s, and all the army-surplus references to MA-1 jackets, parkas, and ribbed sweaters came from the huge collection of military clothes Ive had since before we even began this thing. Add in some slip dresses, technorave sportswear, mesh, and track pants, and there you have it.\n",
      "The truth is that the Rag & Bone guys are, of course, English. They came to the United States and made it on a commercial scale, which would never have been possible on British resources in such quick order. Now Wainwright is so deeply embedded in New York that he sees Brooklyn, where he lives, as home. Inviting his audience to drive out to visit his adopted neighborhood at nine at night was no big ask, in his mind, but more of an act of solidarity with a community. Giving back is always good.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ralph Lauren,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"U.S.R.L. 1967, the patch on a white shirt announced. Jessica Chastain, Julianne Moore, and the rest of us were transported oceanside at Ralph Laurens show this morning. To use a maritime expression, the designer found his sea legs for Spring. Accessories ranged from captains hats to souvenir straw bags to the sort of cork platforms you see in resort towns. As for the clothes, they hewed to the RL standards: preppy yacht-clubbing essentials in a vivid all-American color palette, and cable sweaters draped over shoulders or wrapped around waists. Amid the large offering of navy and tan leather jackets, there was at least one of his de rigueur double-breasted blazers.\n",
      "The seafaring theme was particularly hard to miss in a series of looks in a super-bold, geometric sail print. This was one of Laurens most literal-minded collections in some time, but if the designer and his styling team mightve used a lighter touch to convey the seasons crisp, sporty message, piece by piece there were great clothes. A color-blocked sleeveless jumpsuit had the graphic punch of nautical flags. Clingy knit dresses that took cues from athletic swimsuits looked like theyd be fun to wearin particular, the evening versions with their sexy, strappy backs. And who doesnt love a striped knit? Speaking of stripes, the stars of the show were the evening dresses in cotton broadcloth shirting fabric: haute silhouettes in a humble fabric.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Raquel Allegra,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Whos Raquel Allegras biggest fan? Judging from the designers New York Fashion Week debut, a whole lot of women. Thursdays presentation drew a buzzing crowd, and women from top boutique buyers to a radiant Marisa Tomei grabbed her for selfies. Despite years of showing her collections only on an appointment basis, Allegra is a well-established presence in the industry, and yesterday was vivid testimony to that fact.\n",
      "Allegras work has always been heavily marked by the bohemian, and Spring found her embracing it wholly. Models stood at the edges of a floral mandala created by close friends of the designer, and a psychedelic soundtrack (the 13th Floor Elevators, anyone?) was piped in over the system. \n",
      "Recent seasons have found the designer expanding her purview, integrating other materials into her signature vernacular of supple jersey: denim, lace, leathereven some rabbit fur for Resort. Likewise, there was a lot of newness to be had here: floral separates and dresses in a more conspicuously print-y print than shes shown in past, something for the guys (a Spring mens capsule will be available exclusively at Barneys), and, wait for itfootwear. Coolest were a pair of leather slip-ons that Allegra dubbed the baby of a creeper and a ballet flat.\n",
      "In a lot of ways, that was an apt description for the seasons offering on the whole. Allegras got an evident romantics soul, but some of the best pieces here were the ones that spoke to a punkier edge and pushed her established boundaries a bit. Take the sheer layering pieces in her trademark cobwebby shredding, or a short-sleeved, fringe leather jacket, shown with a top and wide-leg trouser in a murky green and black stripe. She may be a big proponent of oversized pieces, but Allegra surely knows her way around great soft tailoring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rebecca Minkoff,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"One gets the feeling that Rebecca Minkoffs customer might be most familiar with the designers seasonal muses from, say, a Pinterest board. Still, if Minkoff can turn on her young clientele to the likes of Patti Smith or Franoise Hardy, as some of the icons she's envisioned through her kicky clothes, more power to her.\n",
      "For Spring, the inspiration was Marianne Faithfull, whom Minkoff discussed backstage in terms of both her sweetness and her rebelliousness. The designer nodded to that duality with her color story, opening the collection with a parade of virginal ivory, cream, and bone, which soon gave way to plenty of black. The Minkoff girl at her baddest (and coolest) came in an homage to Faithfull as seen in The Girl on a Motorcycle: a lightened-up take on the black leather jumpsuit she wears in the film. Shapes here were a mishmash of the Mod (a sweet suede shift) and the bohemian (maxi tank dresses with a nice flyaway sleeve detail). The hemlines were short, and the designers footwear of choicea pared-back knee-high gladiator with colored Lucite heelscame up long on appeal.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rebecca Taylor,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"One reason Rebecca Taylor is a highlight among contemporary designers is that she trusts her instincts. Rather than reinterpret last seasons trends or cobble together an obscure reference, she taps into what women are craving, whether its a Victorian neckline or something less defined, like a freer, more experimental approach to getting dressed. For Spring she was feeling midi lengths, baby boot-cut pants, and less volume overalldetails that feel right this season, but you cant quite put your finger on why. A-line skirts skimmed the hips before gently flaring out, and off-the-shoulder dresses with big ruffles flattered the arms; they were the kind of pieces that draw you to the rack because theyre pretty, not because they reference a particular decade or mood. \n",
      "Taylor is known for her eccentric feminine prints, and this season she indulged her love of the Bloomsbury Group, a collective of English artists, philosophers, and writers from the early 1900s. She flipped through a heavy coffee-table book and pointed out paintings and drawings that were mirrored in the collections rich florals. Several looks had different prints patchworked together, as if she couldnt choose a favorite; a V-neck, ankle-length dress with capped sleeves was a real standout.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Red Valentino,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli swapped Seattle for the Petit Trianon this season. And given the designers penchant for embroideries and point desprit, Marie Antoinette proved to be a much more natural inspiration than Kurt and Courtney. While Falls grunge references came off somewhat literallywho looks to Red Valentino for a lumberjack shirt, after all?these riffs on eighteenth-century styling seemed more subtle.\n",
      "Take the ruffled corsetry, which lent a new, insouciant charm to the jumpsuit, a popular silhouette that has been in need of a refresh. Since taking the reins at this label, Chiuri and Piccioli have made all things A-line their signature. The hourglass corsets count as genuine news for the duoreason enough to give this little sister line a closer look for Spring. The real stars of the collection, though, were the cap-sleeve, slightly empire-line dresses in delicate layers of lace, hand-embroidered with wildflowers or beaded here and there with small birds. We expect to see Hollywoods young royals in them all awards season long.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Reem Acra,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Reem Acra, a Lebanon native, wanted to show who she was in this collection by combining her past and present life. Acra tied the two together quite literally by using the belt as a jumping-off point. I was going to flea markets all over the world and collecting belts off of people! she said. The accessories had intricate nods to traditional Middle Eastern beading and were embedded into short dresses, highlighting the midsection for a nice bloom-at-the-waist emphasis. The detail became a figure-complementing necessity with pieces like a floral-print V-neck dress with a tulle overlay that cascaded over the shoulders, as well as an orange scoop-neck shirt paired with a twisted aqua skirt.\n",
      "While most of the belts seemed plucked straight from a bazaar in Beirut, not everything was quite as homage paying. There was an almost bohemian, through-the-looking-glass version that was common in the 60s. That factor came through in a metallic-whipped dress with poet sleeves, patterned with paisleys, doused in a groovy palette of lime greens, lavenders, and pinks. A strappy, thigh-skimming chiffon dress was slathered in midnight blue sequins and had dcolletage that dipped into the waist. \n",
      "But it was the floor-skimming gowns that were Acras strong point, and they fully exemplified her meticulous attention to detailthose were full of far-flung, romantic flou. A crimson robe dress secured with a metal-looking clasp belt had strips of emerald beading that lined the opening, eventually curving around the neck for a sliver of sex appeal, while a caftan gown with gold edging and bright red embroidered florals injected a dose of modesty. Both versions would be nice to see on the red carpet this coming awards season.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rhi,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Its easy to think about fashion at the surface level: What makes us feel comfortable, beautiful, powerful, sexy? Most people dont go beyond that to consider how the current state of culture affects their wardrobes, but it plays a big part in what we buy. Rie Yamagata, for example, doesnt approach design with a specific theme or dramatic twist in mind; she just wants to make clothes that cool girls would wear in New York City, Tokyo, and everywhere in between. She thinks about what women crave and, more importantly, why we crave it. Her starting point for Spring 2016 was the Southwest, but she couldnt quite put her finger on how she got there: I think with all the technology happening right now, I just wanted everything to feel natural, she said. We used a lot of natural silks that feel so good against the body. I didnt want to use many synthetics. \n",
      "Words like crafty and artisanal were thrown around the presentation space a lot: You could think of them as the inverse of selfie and wearable tech. A cream silk georgette gown with black trim had the potential to be the perfect one-step summer party uniform, while nubby jacquard jackets and skirts with unfinished hems lent a bit more structure. Even the prints felt just slightly undonea poppy floral was vaguely surreal on a wide-leg jumpsuit, and a few silk dresses featured a blown-up pixel weave print that mimicked fuzzy plaid and houndstooth. But one of the simplest pieces managed to sum up the collection best: A sleek ivory column with a hand-knotted macram placket was equally suited for day and night and nailed that easy yet special balance that feels so fresh right now.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rick Owens,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"In a recent interview, actress Carey Mulligan complained about the fact that the characters she plays are often described as strong women. That label, she said, makes it seem as though strength in a woman is the exception, not the norm. And it rubs her the wrong way. Its not uncommon to experience a similar frisson backstage at a fashion show, when a designer says that his (or her) collection pays tribute to strong womenthe message is always well meant, but by setting up strength as a quality found only in a particular type of woman, it demeans the fairer sex as a whole. At his latest show, Rick Owens put paid to that way of thinking. Owens latest coup de thtre wasnt a tribute to strong women; it was a tribute to female strength. Thats a major distinction.\n",
      "Chanteuse Eska, who performed last year with Owenss wife, Michle Lamy, at the Meltdown Festival in London, presided over this evenings proceedings, singing the theme song from the film Exodus. As she sang, models exited in new Rick Owens lookssome of which, like the sleeveless dusters and crinkled anoraks, registered as atypically accessible silhouettes, while others, such as the short dresses collaged from canvas and leather, reiterated Owenss signature sculptularity in a new, almost dreamlike tone. Periodically, the dfil was interrupted by an incredible sight: a woman, dressed by Owens, carrying another woman down the long length of the runway. Their bodies were yoked together; sometimes the women being carried hung upside down, legs slung over their partners shoulders. Other women were strapped on like backpacks.\n",
      "Speaking before the show, Owens said hed been thinkingwondering, reallyabout the ways women nurture others, metaphorically taking on another human beings weight. That inquiry was communicated forcefully by the shows staging. The carrying women, with their human freight, also suggested the physical labors of pregnancyan undercurrent amplified by the Owens silhouettes featuring distended volumes that were almost carbuncular. When the last model crossed the catwalk, wearing a short dress and one of those terrifically commercial crinkled anoraks, she looked sublimely unburdeneduntil you noted the straps crisscrossing the jacket in back. Even the most sylph-like, seemingly footloose and fancy-free woman is prepared, at any moment, to shoulder a weight. That, at any rate, appeared to be Owenss message in making those load-bearing straps his shows closing image. All women are strong. Even the ones who dont know it yet.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Roberto Cavalli,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 26, 2015\",\"Peter Dundas has a reputation as a classy designer. In his varied career, hes proven his talents at Emanuel Ungaro (doing haute Parisian), Revillon (fur), and Emilio Pucci (sexy rock-chick dressing). Now Dundas has circled back to Roberto Cavalli, the house where he began his careerand where, incidentally, Balmains Olivier Rousteing was once his assistant.\n",
      "Over the past couple of years, the competition among labels to capture the imagination of a new generation has resulted in a remarkable changing of the guard. The domino effect started with Hedi Slimanes democratizing, youth-cult-y success at Saint Laurent; it flowed on through Alessandro Micheles eclectic, vintage-y takeover at Gucci; and most recently it hit New York, putting Public School in charge at DKNY. For his Cavalli comeback, Dundas has handled the commercial situation by sidestepping the haute and embracing street and nightclub-wear with an 80s spin. The result: skimpy body-con dresses, high-waisted animal-print jeans and leggings, sleeveless biker jackets, bandeau tops tied in pouf-y bows on one shoulder, and prom skirts trailing giant frilled trains in their wake.\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with tinkering with 80s styling per seMiuccia Prada, Jonathan Anderson, and Christopher Kane are all dab hands at playing with Princess Di yoked collars, pumped-up Gloria von Thurn und Taxis leg-of-mutton sleeves, and jangling Christian Lacroix-meets-Memphis color and pattern. Theres a fine line of irony, though, which divides the intriguingly kitsch from the literal and cheap looking. Dundas was on sure ground when he tailored leather into neat jackets and sexy pants; these showed his long-standing expertise as a cutter and fitter for beautiful young girls bent on having a good time. But Dundas still needs to find that difficult balance between accessibility and designer leadership. He has all the talent and experience it takes, and a huge swath of friends and goodwill following him. His track record suggests that by next season, hell have it figured out.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rochas,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"Gala Dal, wife of Salvador, was Alessandro DellAcquas muse for Spring. Shes a fitting inspiration for the designer, who has imbued his version of Rochas with whimsy and hyperbole. Both were in evidence in his new Spring collection, which featured torso-spanning bows, beaded giraffe embroideries, and shiny retro bras and briefs (patent? plastic?) underneath lace dresses. And that was just DellAcqua getting stared. There were also jailhouse stripes on a pinafore dress, an Alessandro Michele for Gucci pantsuit moment, and anachronistic graphic tees layered under clouds of white organza.\n",
      "Not unlike his No. 21 collection in Milan last week, this Rochas outing strained under the weight of all DellAcquas ideas. Thats too bad, because there were gems in the mix, like the loose-fitting slip dresses he cut in several different fabrics, prettiest of all a colorful jacquard over which he layered delicate black Chantilly lace. A quick scan of the top e-commerce sites suggests DellAcquas Rochas is a popular label, but the buys tend to be significantly more conservative than what he showed on the runway today. Among the things that made it to the catwalk that were sure to see online are the eccentric but easy-on-the-feet lace skimmers.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rodarte,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Sometimes I feel like its futuristic to go into the past. Sometimes fashion quotes like that one, from Kate Mulleavy, seem to make little sensebut what she was talking about after the beautifully feminine Rodarte show was the powerful effect of taking time to read poetry, and then seeing how it works on your creativity. She and her sister, Laura, spent the summer immersing themselves in Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Emily Dickinson, and Leonard Cohen, while listening to Electric Light Orchestras early synthesized, sparkly music. It seems to have put them into a kind of a 70s-nostalgic trance from which their best collection in a long time proceededa kind of soft glam-rock tenderly sewn into immensely intricate lace dresses, trailing long silk scarves and an aura of Old Hollywood glitter in its wake.\n",
      "Whatever therapy reading poetry offers the soul, it seems to have refocused the Mulleavys on what they do best and believe in most, giving them the heart to fully concentrate on the art of dressmaking, which has always been at their fingertips, but has, at times, drifted from their grasp in the crosscurrents of other pop-cultural seasonal notions. This time, though, their promise was realized in a head-spinningly light and complex series of collages of lace, velvet, embroidery, beading, and silk fringing, cut into Victoriana bodices and swinging gently out from small waists to touch the knee. Such lavish techniques can easily lead to heaviness or a sense of inauthentic costumey-ness, but this was a fully realized and believable fashion look. Down to the black lacy tights, down to the truly enviable gold, silver, and colored suede Deco shoes, it read as a young womans interpretation of what it might take to have a really good night out on the town: non-uptight dressing for maybe dancing and lounging languidly around on couches who knows where.\n",
      "It wasnt all dresses, either. What with the floppily louche lam pantsuits, big shearling chubbies, and some sexy, bugle-beaded miniskirts with flower appliqus curving dangerously upward in the front, this was a collection that achieved the range that has also eluded the Mulleavys till now. Did it move fashion on? Probably not. But as far as Rodarte is concerned, looking to its own past brought out what will stick in memory as one of the most soulfully authentic collections in New York.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rodebjer,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Since moving to New York City from Sweden, Carin Rodebjer has, like many of her fellow city-dwellers, developed an obsession with space. Not outer spacethat was the theme of Rodebjers fine Fall 2015 collectionbut space in general, and having enough of it to move around in. This season she translated the obsession into clothes that emphasized movement. The theme was iterated in various waysdiaphanous silk dresses, kimono-shaped jackets and blouses, culottes made for a long stride. Eyelash fringe underscored the collections sense of motion, as well as adding to its rich sense of texture; so did fabrics like a white silk dappled in silver meant to catch and throw back the light. \n",
      "Silhouettes erred toward the long and the lean, but never so much that the looks came off as in any way constrictive, and the languid tone was echoed in the palette, which moved through rustic earth tones to oceanic blues. There was an element of pop, however: The monochromatic collage prints in sandwashed silk were designed by Rodebjers longtime friend, the artist Liselotte Watkins. The prints geometries, though soft, helped to provide the clothes with a sense of urbanity, one characteristic of Rodebjers oeuvre. For all its vacation-y ease, this was a city-dwellers collection, after all.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Roksanda,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Geometric sculptures dotted the runway like jigsaw puzzles at Roksanda Ilincics show this morning, giving clues to her new collection. Cutouts and asymmetry have been recurring themes on the runways this season, and the designer was thinking along those lines for Spring, too. The show opened with one of her signature floor-length A-line dresses, which was covered with an Abstract Expressionistinspired pattern; but first signs of a more off-center approach came through in a ruffle that snaked along the leg of cropped trousers. That idea reappeared in more recognizable puzzle-like pieces, such as in a sweeping canary yellow and black dress that was cut with keyhole peepholes.\n",
      "Those somewhat tricky experiments in proportion made way for a more fluid silhouette, and the simpler slip dresses in shades of blush, baby blue, yellow, and black were the most convincing looks hereand right in line with the softer, romantic mood of the season. With her mille-feuille shredded chiffon dresses that closed the show, Ilincic took her voluminous aesthetic in an interesting new direction. It would likely require a statuesque beauty like Ilincic herself, though, to pull them off on the red carpet.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Roland Mouret,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"Roland Mourets Galaxy dress turns 10 this year. There have been times during the last decade when Mouret has worked hard to distance himself from that sublime frock, even as the media has never let him forget about it. Today he made a celebration of it, sending the models out for their finale in a rainbow coalition of Galaxy dresses to the delight of the crowd.\n",
      "Designers feel untold pressure to innovateMouret includedand in the endless quest for something new, hes occasionally made dresses too complicated for their own good, with origami-like nipping and tucking at the waistline. The patternmaking has been fairly virtuosic and the hourglass fit sexy, yet the finished product has at times felt overwrought. Mouret avoided that mistake here, opting to explore color and print rather than fabric manipulation, and fixating on the shoulders as a new erogenous zone. In keeping with one of the major trends of the season, there were a handful of cold shoulder dresses, but he made a point of variety, also showing a crisscrossing spaghetti-strap cocktail dress, a fluttery black halter top that descended into a midi-length white skirt, and one-shoulder knits worn with knee-length skirts for a daytime appeal. As for that color and pattern, Mouret took an inclusive approach, offering classic navy on the one hand and bright saffron and mint-green on the other. The most innovative print was actually a laser-cut floral motif on a pair of skirts.\n",
      "The program notes announced a capsule collection of pieces made in the Galaxy dresss image. Theyre already available for sale on the Roland Mouret website. We have a feeling theyll be getting lots of clicks tomorrow.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rosetta Getty,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Rosetta Getty stumbled onto her inspiration this season. She was at the Getty Center, checking out the Jackson Pollocks, and happened to notice museum workers installing the show Yvonne Rainer: Dances and Films. That got her thinking about postmodern danceits expansiveness and its naked expressivenessand about the aesthetics of the dance world in general.\n",
      "Getty extrapolated the dance theme pretty directly here, and to very appealing effect. She emphasized fluid silhouettes that could accommodate movement, whether in calf-length skirts and dresses with trumpet silhouettes, or fine rib tees with a leotard-like fit, or trousers with a pajama sense of ease. There were also lots of openings and slits, often created via apron-ish ties. Wrapping and tying were already idiomatic to Getty, but she nicely updated her vocabulary this season: The apron-style tunics, open at the side, and white satin wrap dress piped in black were two particularly strong looks.\n",
      "As usual, much of the beauty of Gettys collection was to be found in her fabrics. For example, the crepe she used is, you have to believe, the very best crepe. The excellence of its hand-feel cant really be imparted in words or photos, but a glance at Gettys taupe V-neck gown hints at its terrific drape. Likewise, the cotton poplin she used in her charming flounced off-the-shoulder tops was paradigmatically light and crispy, and the georgette of a black cape-sleeved gown was Platonically silky. One of Gettys grace notes was her tonal, textural adaption, in luxe white viscose, of the paisley print seen elsewhere in silk. Her trousers and wrapped tunic top in the viscose fused pliancy and authority in much the way a top-notch dancer does. Getty did her stumbled-on inspiration proud.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Rosie Assoulin,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Rosie Assoulin is having a good time. The bonhomie is self-evident in her clothes, which often come off as immaculately crafted surrealist jokes. Assoulin isnt as sly or pointed as Elsa Schiaparelli was, at least not yet, but shes working in the same playful vein. This season, for instance, she traded in the dirigible-size gowns for which shes been known, and focused instead on recontextualizing the most casual of wear, to wit, bathing suits, pajamas, and underwear. The undies were boxers poking out of slouchy twill pants theyd been sewn into; the pajama-inspired looks came bedazzled in grids of tiny Swarovski crystals or, more slinky yet, were executed in iridescent crystal mesh. Swimsuits, meanwhile, offered Assoulin numerous opportunities to have funtriangle tops as daywear! candy-color bikini bottom ties as embellishment on a cocktail dress! magnified ties cinching the sides of pants!and she parried those riffs with mariner-inspired looks. Workingman and vacationing lady meet at the waters edge: A romantic comedy, by Rosie Assoulin.\n",
      "As far as the evening looks went, Assoulin didnt entirely jettison her penchant for volume and exaggeration this season, but she did rein it way, way in. There were gowns and long skirts that spread out from the hip in godet pleats, and formal tops with Mannerist sleeves. But the designer seemed more turned on by the subtler elements here, like the snaps that allowed a one-shoulder pink frock to shape-shift, if the wearer so desired, or those bedazzled crystal grids. Assoulin is finding new outlets for her sensibility, in other words, and relying less on operatic effects. Surely Schiap would approve.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ryan Lo,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"Ryan Lo expressed his yen for maximalist cutesiness through a series of treacly-sweet tropes of Valentines schtick, anime superheroes, and fairy-tale archetypes in this tasty sugar rush of a collection. The frills kept coming, frolicking up jersey socks, trousers, and dresses, cavorting hither and thither in crema whorls against printed jersey. Heaped-on jewelry and lost-in-the-forest mussed-up hair added entirely unnecessary but hey-why-not drama and flash. \n",
      "Acid pick-and-mix intarsia knits with punctuations of knot were the looser, sometimes anguish-touched exhalations. There were heaps of craft, passion aplenty, and reams of reference that Los note writer, Susie Lau, reported featured sweet Kiki from Hayao Miyazakis Kikis Delivery Service and the kawaii witches from Ryans childhood faves Sugar Sugar Rune and Magical DoReMi. Harajuku heaven.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ryan Roche,Chioma Nnadi,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Some designers drift from season to season looking for a current mood or muse to propel their vision onward. Others, like Ryan Roche, find that the best way to move their label forward comes by returning to a consistent, highly personal aesthetic. In Roches case, that means a veritable obsession with softness, a delicate palette (with a particular fondness for the palest shade of blush), and what can only be called coziness. Thats not to say that her clothes arent forward-thinking: With her latest collection she continued to marry a finely wrought fashion sensibility with a real commitment to ease.\n",
      "As far as starting points, the look of nineties minimalism and ballerinas in rehearsal was percolating in Roches minds eye for Spring. The overall effect was more languid than you would expect from a dancers working uniform though, and a cream robe and slightly oversize ribbed pink sweater would make for luxurious pieces to roll around in on a lazy Sunday afternoon. \n",
      "These days that casual yet luxurious approach to everyday dressing appeals beyond the weekend, and Roches laid-back elegance speaks to the way many women want to dress right now. That her popular cashmere sweaters came with subtle modern twistsan asymmetric ruffle here, a belted waist therewas all the more reason to fall for them (or more specifically, wrap up in them). Its been a year since Roche was named a runner-up in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition, and its clear from her latest collection that shes headed in the right direction.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sacai,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Sacais Chitose Abe landed a Nike collaboration earlier this year, and her name has come up as a possible candidate for the open creative director job at Balenciaga. Wed put her clothes in the top handful of most visible brands on the street style scene, and shes become highly influential for other designers. So, whats the problem? Easy: Abes level of popularity breeds familiarity, and as tempting as it may be to stick with what sells, shes also aware that she must move on to maintain the level of enthusiasm and support shes lately enjoyed. \n",
      "Her niche has been the concept of hybrids. Abe will combine a sweater and a button-down shirt, a tweed blazer with a biker jacket, or a kilt with a flowing chiffon skirt. For Spring, the idea was to push things further. Its not only about hybrids, but about distortion to get new shape, her right-hand man, Daisuke Gemma, said afterward. We worked very hard. That much was clear. The foundations were familiarvintage shop souvenir scarves, bandanas, Peruvian blanketsbut where they ended up was somewhere way, way beyond basic. These were audaciously complex clothes, constructed from many layers and with a sense of disarraystraps spilling suggestively off shoulders, slashed waistbands falling slack at the hipsintentionally built in. \n",
      "It was chaotic, just like Paradise Garage was back in the day. (The New York City 80s clubs logo tees appeared here, as they did in her mens collection back in June.) But it was controlled chaos. Abe belongs to an elite group of the most ingenious designers working today. The navy and gold floral pieces (not lace, she pointed out backstage, but embroideries with the negative space laser-cut away) are about to become as ubiquitous as all of the Sacai pieces outside the shows today.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sachin & Babi,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"It used to be you could get away with buying one good dress for an entire social season. But with the advent of social media, notable outfits are made to be documented and sharedmaking the economics of re-wearing garments slightly more problematic for the Instagram set.\n",
      "Babi Ahluwalia, who along with her husband, Sachin, founded Sachin & Babi, said this year she visited several trade shows and spoke directly to a number of customers who expressed anxiety over re-wearing evening gowns after posting images of their outfit on social media. At the same time, they told the designer, they couldnt justify spending thousands of dollars on a dress theyd wear only once. Respecting this new digital landscape, the Ahluwalias paid extra attention this season to evening separates that can be mixed and matched. Strapless trapeze tops in frothy white eyelet or printed chiffon could be worn with a matching skirt or with pants to create an entirely new look (and entice a few double taps, no doubt). The designers were also mindful of the price tag: Everything in the collection is under $1,000, except a hand-embroidered layer cake of a dress that hovers around $1,200 and had enough technical detail to warrant the added cost.\n",
      "Those were the most exciting offerings from the brand. Less so were the more straightforward cocktail dresses, though the couple still found a way to add interest by way of off-the-shoulder necklines and bold, abstract floral prints.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Saint Laurent,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"Commercially, Hedi Slimane has no more to prove with what hes set out to do at Saint Laurent. In a word: selling. His thorough refurb, from advertising to video, to music connections to multiple lines of product, has turned Saint Laurent into a power brand. More than that, the success of his breaking down the house and rendering it into accessible, uncomplicated items has set off a chain reaction at the top of the designer fashion industry. Heads have been rolling and new ones put in place all over Milan, New York, and Paris as corporations scramble to cast talents they pray will be able to replicate Slimanes magic touch with multiproduct marketing. With Alessandro Micheles appointment at Gucci, the process has been working at speed, but in some other places there are bandwagons still stuck in the garage. \n",
      "Not everyone can package up a look and whack it to the public in such a first-degree, widely understandable, and Zeitgeist-savvy way as Slimane. For Spring, one glance at the lowbrow tiaras, the sparkly see-through mini-mesh dresses, the rock-chick leather jackets, and the skinny legs of the models shoved into Wellington boots told us where he was going. To Glastonbury with Courtney and Kate it was, with an entourage of throwback shaggy-headed waifs and a caravan-load of ready-made vintage-y stuff. \n",
      "Slimane was smart to suggest he was pitching it in a more down-to-earth way this season. There is a movement toward real, ordinary clothes going on, largely triggered by the left-of-field rise of the Vetements collective, which ingeniously repurposes generic garments. Slimane seemed to have tuned into that when he came up with a perfectly ordinary beige trenchcoat, sand-color camisole, jeans and black Wellingtons, a faded army-surplus shirt, patchworked denim capes, and leather bomber jackets that looked as if they could have been trawled from racks at the cheap end of Portobello Market. Say what you like about whether this is actually design, there is a skill in making a familiar-looking garment fit well and come off as generic enough to be absorbed into a girls wardrobe, and Saint Laurents sales have shot up because of it. \n",
      "Still, the grunge and glitter theme also gave Slimane the key to turning out his more special things, too: loads of variations on the bias-cut slip dress in metallic sequins or velvet patchwork, liquid gold charmeuse or black silk, plus glam fur and feather chubbies.\n",
      "Finally, though, there is only one litmus test which will make this, or any collection, sell: Is the girl on the runway someone other girls want to be? Slimanes good at pushing classic youth-cultural buttons, but in his casting the one thing hes not in touch with is the fact that todays young girls want to look at other girls who represent the way they look. How long will it take for designers to realize how badly theyre cutting their own chances by not reflecting that?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sally LaPointe,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Sally LaPointe is best known for her super-luxe knitsthink simple pullovers with fox-fur sleeves and plush cashmere-wool turtlenecks with just enough slouch. Cozy textures are her thing, but since its easier to experiment with pony hair, leather, and merino during the Fall season, Spring always presents a challenge for the designer. This time, LaPointe translated her rich vision by juxtaposing lightweight textures that could still be layered in balmy weather. I was really inspired by the idea of introverts and extroverts, she said backstage. I dont think you can pin anyone down and define them. Everyone is kind of both, so I wanted to present something with a lot of contrasts. A glossy pony robe coat was spliced with pleated (and surprisingly pliable) vinyl, and a chunky, sleeveless sweater was thrown over a swishy sequin skirt. It would make a chic party lookyou could even wear flats! \n",
      "LaPointe acknowledged that this was a new direction for the brand. But her customers, many of whom shop at Bergdorf Goodman, her biggest retailer, come back to her because they want luxurious, wearable pieces that feel a bit unexpectedand that's just what they'll find here.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Saloni,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"Saloni Lodha launched her brand on the strength of its signature printed dresses. That focus has always served her well, but this time around the designer finally feels shes in a place to branch out. This is the biggest collection weve ever done, said Lodha, who added denim, leather, and T-shirt categories to her lineup this season. I didnt want to expand too soon. Now we are at a stage with our retailers where they really can see us as a full brand.\n",
      "Brand extensions can go either way, of course. But here, the new categories were a major boon: Lodha successfully translated the lines signature playful femininity into those aforementioned leather and denim jackets, jeans, and T-shirts by way of clever embellishments. A favorite included a 70s-inspired cropped denim jacket with a random spattering of grommets in primary colors that is sure to be street style photography bait next season, while a leather jacket embroidered with flowers was an unexpected alternative for evening. Often the new categories furthered themes that have been central to Lodhas aesthetic from the beginning: A pair of organic natural-dye jeans, in which you can see stripes of variation in the springy pink hue, were made in Pondicherry, India, the same area that Lodha named her LLC for when she first launched her business.\n",
      "But the core of the brand will always be printed dresses; theyre a buyers no-brainer and a consistent best-seller. For Spring, the designer tweaked some of the offerings to go even more romantic, with skin-baring cutouts and prints painted on lace. All in all, this collection was a strong step forward for Saloni.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Salvatore Ferragamo,Nicole Phelps,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Flavia Pennetta, the Italian winner of this years US Open, received a round of applause from the audience as the lights went down at Salvatore Ferragamo. Her surprise victory didnt impact creative director Massimiliano Giornettis latest offering, which was underway months ago; nonetheless there was a certain synergy in the matchup. Giornettis latest collection had a buoyant grace. Though it's not activewear by any stretch of the imagination, a woman could be active in these dresses and look great. \n",
      "Leather is almost obligatory chez Ferragamo, even for Spring. Giornetti did a fine job of making it suitable for warm weather, cutting it in generous proportions and using bar-tacked seams that quite literally let a paperbag-waist skirt and loose-fitting culottes breathe. But despite the houses shoemaking legacy, the best pieces here werent skins. Rather, they were the midi-length sundresses in lofty cotton: one in black with bows on the shoulder straps; a strapless style with a wrapped waist in sky blue; and another strapless frock that combined tiers or black, dusty pink, and coral. Knit dresses had a springy bounce, too. By comparison, chiffon numbers with feather embellishments looked fussy, and there were a few too many extraneous bows on other pieces. Still, all in all, this was a good-looking outing for Giornetti.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Samuji,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 16, 2015\",\"On a recent phone call, Samu-Jussi Koski reported that the consensus from friends and family was that his clothes had done some growing up since last spring. Its an unexpected comment, perhaps, given the certain ageless appeal that has always characterized the Samuji brand. But there was a new serenity to this seasons looks, owing in part to the scaled-back quirk factor. Gone were the high-shine silver metallics, the crafty mermaid print, and the kicky colors. In their place, the designer delivered a concise lineup of spare, tranquil pieces inspired by the glamour of mid-century film stars holidaying in the south of Italy; the results were far from retro. A palette that took its cues from the delicate shades of gelatopistachio, melon, peachlent a subtle sweetness, tempered by modern-feeling shapes (terrific cropped flares) and fabrications (a glossy, leather-like black resin-coated cupro). Knits remain a strong category for the label, like a sheer, sea-foam-color mock neck, ideal for layering, or svelte ribbed styles to team with an A-line mini. Another strong suit of Koskis? Outerwear, especially two styles in washi paper, a fabrication thats far more environmentally friendly than, say, viscose; thats a choice that is both grown-up and great-looking.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sea,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Sea designers Sean Monahan and Monica Paolini have long been associated with a breezy, hippieish spirit, but theyve started to sense that others are encroaching on their territory. Were trying to move away from boho a bit, Monahan said, surrounded by at least seven racks in the duos airy Canal Street loft (a fifth-floor escape amid the chaos of New York Fashion Week). Seas signatureslace, eyelet, embroidery, and looser silhouettescertainly fit the boho stereotype, and they also happen to be trending heavily elsewhere. And while Sea consistently feels easy and effortless, some other designers iterations of the boho trend seem overwrought. So for Spring, Monahan and Paolini opted for sleeker shapes, such as culottes, quilted jackets, and boxy blouses, and nixed their usual hand-distressing. It added up to clothes that were as arty and youthful as ever, but just a touch more refined, which will only help them at their biggest stockist, Barneys New York. For example, instead of holey jeans, they washed their ice-blue denim over and over so it emerged as soft as cashmere. It was particularly covetable on a slit-front midi skirt with a braided belt. The designers also played with heavier, more geometric lace patterns, which felt refreshingly non-flimsy, and in lieu of complicated embroideries, they employed the beauty of natural textures like rumpled linen and crisp cotton. \n",
      "Without question, daywear is Seas specialty, but there were some surprisingly chic day-to-night propositions, too, like a deep-V indigo jumpsuit and an apron-front gingham dress. Both would look equally lovely with white sneakers or glittery stilettos, but it would be interesting to see what Monahan and Paolini might do with a tux or silk party dress.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,See by Chlo,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Where does the See By Chlo girl go when the winds of travel blow her stateside? Cali, of course! This season Clare Waight Keller imagined her muse roadtripping from San Francisco to Big Sur, bringing with her clothes that reflected the houses Anglo-Franco vibe and all but guaranteed a good time. Here were breezy pieces in a sunbleached palette that spoke to days spent driving around with the top down: cream, soft peach, washed-out blues. Denim came in two distinct formscrisp indigo and a supple, lighter shade that felt akin to something you had worn and loved for years. That was just one of many parallels with the looks that went down the main line runway last Spring: frothy broderie anglaise, here trimming blouses; dreamy bohemian gowns; head-to-toe total look dressing. SBC even debuted another take on Waight Kellers jean maxi skirt, this one slung low on the hips and with a frayed hem.\n",
      "Elsewhere a geometric archival Chlo print from the seventies found new life in a knit dress and sweater. There was plenty of lovely, youthful sprezzatura to be had here, and even if Chlos more senior customer might take a pass on the graphic sweatshirts, you got the sense that she wouldn't hesitate to snap up other styles for some adventuring of her own.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sharon Wauchob,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"When Sharon Wauchob said, Sometimes you dont want to change anything, and then there are times when youre hungry for something new, she made a key admission of a feeling likely shared by other designers. For this collection, Wauchob was operating in the latter headspace without betraying the former. One wouldnt normally associate her restrained and refined approach with the word unhinged, yet thats how she framed this go-round, pointing out how, as a woman designer, the end goal isnt necessarily shock value so much as defying expectations.\n",
      "Wauchob did that by using techniques that imbued her clothes with a spectrum of strong personalities. Whereas the crushed pleated silk jumpsuit registered as romantically restless, bouncing with each stride, a lace slip dress festooned with tufts of cardinal red silk fringe signaled something wilder. The collection tempted from all directions, in no case more than a skirt fronted with leather and backed with lace. Even the unlined suede coats, encircled with low-slung belts featuring an irregular brass medallion, hinted at that same alluring ease. If all that matters to a potential client is the degree of sheerness, then that person is missing the point (or should stick to the ingenious cross-body bag, dangling from a single eyelet). Suffice it to say, the level of savoir faire surpassed layman explanations; and with so many permutations of such provocative workmanship, the fabrication details barely mattered.\n",
      "With Wauchob, its easy to default to calling her collections delicate; but consider the slouched trousers, sneakers, and new sculptural jewelry by Chris Boland, and the descriptor becomes imprecise at best. Despite all the vintage and vaguely Asian influences, this lineup captured Wauchobs desire to bridge past and future. The desire has probably always been there; its just taken her until now to let go of being understated.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sibling,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Its really remarkable that Siblings Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery managed not only to put on a show this afternoon, so soon after the death of their partner in style, Joe Bates, but to stage one filled with such joie de vivre. The collection was dedicated to Bates, whose presence was much felt by his absence, but it was also a tribute to 60s starlets such as Monica Vitti and Brigitte Bardot, and imagined them bumming around the Riviera in various iterations of leopard print. The 60s reference wasnt particularly literal: Bryan and McCreery gave it a strong disco gloss, with lots of sparkling knits, and their way of riffing on the eras fascination with man-made fabrications was to create skirts, dresses, and coats in whipstitched sculpted plastic. Those items were highly editorial, as were the cape and gown in a ball-bedecked crochet.\n",
      "Other looks were more street-ready. The glittery knit slip dresses and cardigans were accessible and appealing, while items in leopard-print denim could happily find a home in many a sassy girls wardrobe. A short-sleeved swing coat in the denim seemed well suited to a contemporary would-be Bardot. The highlights of the show, however, were two other, similarly shaped pieces of outerwear: The frilled plastic and gold-tipped knit coats had the madcap quality one seeks in a Sibling collection and showcased the labels signature innovative knit work, but they came off as viably wearable rather than camp or experimental or absurd. No doubt Bates would have been proud.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Simon Miller,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"Jake Sargent and Daniel Corrigans Spring outing for Simon Miller combined their perennial Japanese influences with an American Southwest attitude. Here was a collection that was sparse in spirit but had a great richness to it thanks to the fabrications the designers opted for. Their biggest aesthetic splurges came where color was concerned: Pops of burnt red and chartreuse felt right in step with more sun-bleached neutrals and tawny nubuck.\n",
      "Also new this season: A strong move into bags at opposite ends of the size spectrum, from the itty-bitty Bonsai with ring handleswhich was right in step with street styles current yen for tiny shapesto a big bucket bag to carry all your worldly possessions and sling over your shoulder.\n",
      "Knitwear was especially appealing. Chalk that up to the Japanese silk tops and skirts, which projected a kind of cool, mid-century austerity. As far as denim was concerned, the duo made a bet on their great wide leg as a hero silhouette, offering it in a buttery suede that will be tough to beat in terms of simple, laid-back luxury for spring.\n",
      "In addition to the bags, the pair is finding other ways of emphasizing Simon Miller as a lifestyle brand. They have launched an eyewear collaboration with New York optical legend Sol Moscot and teamed up for an offbeat sandal capsule collection with the cultlike Japanese footwear label Jojo. Simon Miller may not be a new kid on the block but, in Sargent and Corrigans expert hands, it continues its confident march toward becoming a household name.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Simone Rocha,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Its a wonderful thing when a young designer truly comes into her own, at a point when expectations and respect have already been running high, but then she simply exceeds all that. Simone Rocha sent that feeling through her audience today withwhen it comes down to itthe amazing things she did with pink dresses. That sounds narrow, if not sugary, but from the two semitransparent opening looks she showedpuff-sleeved, full-skirted, and boldly bisected with black macram strapsshed already riveted the attention of everyone who had come to see her show in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London. It takes some daring for a young designer to hire a former royal palace, heaving with gilding and British establishment history, but there she was, amongst the grandeur it all, showing an entrancing collection which succeeded in elevating her talent for prettiness, sexuality, tenderness, and quirky techniques to a new level.\n",
      "Where did that come from? I found out I was pregnant while I was in Japan, working on a project with Dover Street Market Ginza, and then went on to Kyoto for a few days, said Rocha. I was suddenly seeing everything so intensely, it felt trippy! It wasnt a collection which overtly stated Japanese influenceswhich of course can be hackneyedso much as it insinuated and abstracted them. Part of it was down to Rochas adulation of the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, to whose bar she made a pilgrimage in Tokyo. Arakis body of work involves specialist bondage practices peculiar to Japan. Thats what triggered Rocha to start thinking about knots and braids, and begin developing cross-body straps, whole bodices in clear plastic, and finishing dresses with silken strands running across bare backs. \n",
      "Rarely have the notions of prettiness and perversity from a young womans point of view come together so potently. This was also a collection which absolved Rocha of any former accusations of heaviness and repetition. Her airy, bouncy organza skirts put paid homage to that, just as the new, chic bubble-sleeved narrow dresses, the series of spongy tailoring decorated with kimono-cum-couture bows, and the green bamboo-forest prints proved something else: Rocha has range. It was a personal breakthrough.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sonia by Sonia Rykiel,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"The girl who wears Sonia by Sonia Rykiel may be updating her wardrobe every seasona coat with trompe l'oeil detailing here, a leather striped miniskirt therebut shes consistently the same playful gal at heart. For Spring, there happened to be a lot of hearts: embroidered together as broderie anglaise, swirled into a bandana paisley, frilled and tacked onto the shoulders of a tee, studded to the back of a heel (the liveliest of all appeared mid-wink, as if making eye contact with its Comme des Garons pals). There were other motifs, too, including warmly hued rainbows, simplified flowers, and a particularly sassy pair of lips that could be zipped open and shut from the chest of a sweater. \n",
      "If the collection sounds like it put too much emphasis on throwback prints, the overall effect didnt exhaust the eyes. This was largely owing to additional themes that expanded upon reliable Rykiel signatures. A denim story, for instance, did not always consist of jeans; indigo tweed cleverly conveyed as much versatility, while dark blue satin dressed down a sequined shift. For all the integrated embellishments, accessories factored stronglyand surrealisticallyin giving the looks an updated twist. See also: the sparkly socks paired with high-heeled sandals. And when a Lurex dress, specially knit to appear striped, was referred to as ideal date-night attire, the sweet side of Sonia by Sonia suddenly turned coquettish. Except that this Rive Gauche girl of the street (the photos, taken once again by Sonia Sieff, show Langley Fox posing in the middle of the road) is far more likely to wear her heart on her sleeve than make an outright shameless gesture.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sonia Rykiel,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"We were back at Sonia Rykiels famous Left Bank shop for Julie de Librans Spring show today. The recently installed bookshelves were covered with black velvet curtains and the runway glittered like wet pavement. Waiters passed around electric blue cocktails and Londons C.A.R. provided the soundtrack, setting the stage for a collection pitched mostly toward evening. Saint-Germain-des-Prs, in addition to its famous brasseries and cafs, also has a thriving club culture, according to the program notes. In De Librans first two runway shows for the French brand, the offerings were broader, but this one began and ended with sequins. \n",
      "In between, the designer touched on the famous Rykiel sweaters, turning out baseball-style tees in a thick crochet that looked handmade and slinky pliss knit dressesbut sadly there were no stripes, the house signature. Note to designers at heritage brands: Dont ignore the heritage. The shows loose theme was les oiseaux de nuitnight owlso there were bird motifs on everything from a poplin camp shirt to silk pajama sets, and more than a few marabou feather stoles. Cotton dresses in a swallow print that looked a lot like camo were the shows best pieces: danceable, yet also easy to wear during the day. We wouldnt have minded seeing more of that kind of thing. But before or after dark, easy-to-wear was an imperative for De Libran. The holographic sequin dresses that closed the show were knitted, not embroidered, and the back sides were fine-gauge sweaters, meaning they were as light as can be and as comfortable as a T-shirt, but glam nonetheless.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sophie Theallet,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"The Sophie Theallet show this evening kicked off with a bang. A literal one: Audience members snapped to attention as a drummer pounded out a loud beat from the far reaches of Theallets outdoor show space. The attention was called for, as this latest collection from the designer was one for which you wanted to be wide awake.\n",
      "This was a joyful fashion show. The music, supplied by a troupe of Senegalese drummers, was thoroughly happy-making, and so were the clothes, the best that Theallet has ever produced. Africa was the key reference here, unabashedly so. It was a dream of Africa, as Theallet put it, that she extrapolated via textures of raffia and burlap, cape silhouettes, and extraordinary, couture-quality lace that read a bit like snakeskin. There were also beautiful smudged black-and-white prints that riffed on tribal body paint, and halter necklines redolent of traditional African chokers. Theallet was appropriating, but with such a fluency and generosity of spirit, and with such good instincts about how to integrate her African inspiration into prototypically Western silhouettes, that the appropriation felt earned. The Theallet womanand she was a woman, not a girlhadnt just gone to Africa and returned with some fresh ideas about aesthetics. Shed come back with a whole new point of view.\n",
      "There were too many standout looks here to list them all. Theallet made magic with her lace, using it with subtlety as a cobwebby layer of black on top of a caramel-colored cape, and to much more graphic effect in gridded dresses and skirts. She also wowed the crowd with two sexy striped lace jumpsuits that were shown on genuinely full-figured girls. (This Theallet show was a model for diverse casting in general, by the way.)\n",
      "Theallet updated her signature hourglass silhouette with panache, using broad raffia belts to set off her full shorts and mid-calf skirts. The halter-neck dresses and gowns featuring tiers of feathers and raffia strips belong on a red carpet, posthaste. And the daywear spanned from breezily feminine, with ruffled silk dresses in a small smudged dot print, to burlap linen tailoring that was almost utilitarian, it was so matter-of-fact. Theallet finally found her niche as a tailor with this collectionthese looks were nearly as confident as the diaphanous sheer numbers that found her revisiting the brand vocabulary thats been native to her from the start. It was fitting that this show concluded with a burst of drumming and dancing: Theallet was due a celebration.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Sportmax,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Clinically minimal with a twist of 60s redux (deluxe), this maritime-seasoned Sportmax collection should cruise serenely from runway to store rack to wardrobe. A toughened-up pinafore shirthemmed dress in heavy white cotton featured the round black pockets that were the ongoing contradiction to pure restraint here. They also came on wide sailor pants, a lightweight parka, and a high-waisted jacket used as a topsail over a white silk blouse.\n",
      "There was so much finely draped fabric a-swoosh at the base of another pinafore that sailed forth full-length and zingily orange, that it was hard to make out if it qualified strictly as a dress (possible) or jumpsuit (probably). Assuredly the latter was a deep-V-neck, kicky-legged muster of irregular monochrome stripes against navy and more orange. A pair of tangerine-size eyelets just above the navel on a white shirtdress and a blue front-zip culottes-suit allowed for some hearty, here-to-there belt knotting.\n",
      "The chain print that clanked to the foreground neatly mirrored the chrome buckles on collars and accompanying bucket bags. Cast next was a net print on silk jumpsuits, sweaters, and skirts, before the introduction of grids of round lace as a curtain-closing motif. The lack of a Breton stripe showed admirable restraint in what was a Cardin-tinged assembly of sea-flecked 21st-century staples: placid and pleasing.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Stella Jean,Kerry Olsen,MILAN,\" September 23, 2015\",\"As in seasons past, Stella Jeans show was a vibrant cultural nook. Despite its bold colors and zingy patterns, this was no straightforward travel story. Migration was the topic the Italo-Haitian designer highlighted Wednesday through her Spring offering, which she showcased, refreshingly, on a multi-racial model cast. In the face of the largest movement of refugees on the Continent since World War II, and with Italy becoming one of the main landing points, it was a bold move to launch a windblown Milan Fashion Week with a statement, and in a new and apt venuethe citys recently opened cultural center Museo delle Culture (Museum of Cultures), or Mudec.\n",
      "Departure was the starting point, and the designers printed T-shirts emblazoned with imagery from Once Upon a Time in Americathe Sergio Leone filmwas a pithy reference to Italys historical flux. From there, sweeping in scope, the saturated colors, rich textures, and intricate detailing of the opening looks drew references from South American climes. Voluminous, printed, flounced, and maxi skirts recalled traditional Salvadoran dressSalvador is commonly called Bahiaand the spot where immigrants historically entered Brazil. Pom-poms, tassels, and beads embellished many of Jeans playful accessories, like great raffia bejeweled slides and handbags. Roomy Andean-striped coats and jackets as well as cactus and parrot prints were a contemporary take on the regions ornate style.\n",
      "Overlapping continents, Jeans signature Wax & Stripes designsmade of vibrant patterns worn across West Africaappeared as ruffle-sleeved tunics and skirts and prim appropriations of silk pussy-bow blouses. From there the collection shifted to England. Highlighting the current exponential growth of Italian immigration to the U.K., Savile Row tailoring was the designers inspiration, and trenchcoats and natty shirting the material result.\n",
      "Embracing what her label is known forusing African prints on European formsJeans barefooted finale consisted of very commercial beachwear with a retro 50s aira breezy way to end her powerful, far-flung adventure.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Stella McCartney,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"The key to summertime dressing is effortlessness. Its a principle that Stella McCartney applies to all of her collections, and it was in full effect at her upbeat show this morning, where she put a major emphasis on knits. Knitwear has become more visible on Spring runways over the last couple of fashion cycles as innovative, computer-enabled techniques have allowed designers to do things not possible before. Theres another reason sweater dressing is on the rise, and it comes down to the comfort factor. McCartneys layered tanks, polo shirts, and tube skirts looked stretchy as activewear, sporty and poised for action on the athletic sandals they paraded out on, but elevated in bright stripes, checks, and transparencies. She also played with vibrant, pleated knits in loose trapeze-like shapes with sexy cutaways. Its been a great week for color in Paris, but McCartneys as bold as anybody, combining vivid orange and blue or chili red with pink on those knit separates. Swirls of ribbon embroidery made a similarly strong impact on tracksuits and dresses.\n",
      "Her other project here was rethinking the suit, which has been an icon of the brand from the beginning. She did that via deconstruction; a double-breasted black jacket was transformed into a strapless, form-fitting tunic worn over a multi-slit skirt. And she did it by using unexpected materials, as was the case with an off-the-shoulder jacket and slouchy pants cut from raw indigo denim with high-contrast white stitching. More conventional pieces like vests and trousers had an appealing fluidity and elongated proportions. \n",
      "Slip dresses were another key component of her first collection postSaint Martins nigh on 20 years ago. Theres never been a bigger moment for boudoir dressing than Spring 2016, but McCartney more or less avoided the subject. A missed opportunity? Not really. In acid hues, her swirling eyelet dresses will stand out at stores next spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Suno,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"The first thing Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty wanted to talk about backstage at this mornings Suno show was the shoes. After umpteen seasons collaborating with Nicholas Kirkwood, Suno has launched its own line of Italian-made footwear. Beatty said the goal was to create shoes that looked distinctive, but that were easy to wear: Not too precious, she explained, but also not, you know, too fierce.\n",
      "Not too precious/not too fierce also served as a good summation of the clothes on Sunos runway. Inspired by a visit to the recent exhibition When the Curtain Never Comes Down at the American Folk Art Museum, the designers riffed on the practice of outsider artists who channeled compulsive mental states into their work. Their focus was on the ways that these artists would use geometry to create a sense of orderhence the collections repeating square patterns and numerous looks belted (Beatty used the apt word restricted) at the waist. One of the nice ways that Beatty and Osterweis got at their theme was by introducing little grace notes of off-ness, such as the seemingly random placement of gathers on items like the opening dress in gingham. They also made reference to the origin of their inspiration by using folksy techniques and fabricsthat gingham, for instance, but also eyelet, peasant blousestyle ruching, and denim. A calf-length denim skirt, shown with a matching belted minidress, was the best look in the show.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Suzanne Rae,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" October 19, 2015\",\"Im not your seductress. That was designer Suzanne Raes mantra for Spring, a manifesto for women who dress for themselves, not the gaze of others; in short, her customers. Rae makes quietly arty staples that place an emphasis on construction and fit. Here she struck a balance between concealing and revealing: boxy, unisex shapes like kimonos in Japanese denim, and clingier bias-cut dresses. Trousers and tops in a sheeny cotton nylon were standouts, and gave way to other novel fabrications like a white Italian jacquard splashed all over with burnout blooms. That print felt like a rarebut welcomeextravagance among so many garments that receded, down to their clear buttons. One development for Rae that was anything but retiring? A group of two-tone ribbed knits in juicy, jolie-laide color combos; there was a certain seductiveness to themthe kind that will pit cool girls against their wallets.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tadashi Shoji,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"When asked backstage about the through line for his Spring 2016 collection, Tadashi Shoji summed it up in one word: Japan. The designer has been feeling nostalgic of late. Maybe, he suggested, because Im old. For Resort he mined his childhood spent in Japan, and this season he continued the theme with an homage to his native country in the springtime. \n",
      "Shoji drew from the obvious: The peonies, irises, and cherry blossoms that explode all over the country in spring were clearly the inspiration behind a number of looksperhaps too much so. A frothy pink cupcake of a gown with fluffy floral appliqus, for instance, unmistakably recalled the sakura in bloom. It was far from groundbreaking, to be sure, but for Shojis customer thats not necessarily a problem.\n",
      "The designer seemed to save up all his daring for a handful of sheer gowns with strategically placed floral embroidery to conceal the good bitsnot unlike the headline-making gown Beyonc wore to the Met Gala this year. Everybody is doing sheerRihanna and all those people are doing it, and revealing a lot [on the red carpet], said Shoji backstage. But I dont like that. So, I very nicely hid everything and it still looks beautiful. Shojis clients will no doubt appreciate the modesty.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Talbot Runhof,Tina Isaac-Goiz,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"By Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhofs estimation, they have done about 800 variations of their ruched stretch dress, whose svelte effect has endeared the brand to legions of political wives, red carpet regulars, and other women with busy social lives back home in Germany and elsewhere. Thanks to that little number, Talbot Runhof has quietly built a small empire and, last spring, the house unveiled a new flagship in a Baroque-style manse in Munich. \n",
      "Theres always a lot going on at Talbot Runhof. For Spring, the story was very much about a palatial lifestyle. In the same spirit as last seasons homage to Mona Bismarck, a copy of the lavish Marella Agnelli: The Last Swan, picked up at Rizzoli in New York City, became the springboard for exploring what the duo terms sleek maximalism. In other words, they remained true to their love of intricacy but toned down the volume just a tad, sticking to noble fabrics and a neutral palette jazzed up with the occasional splash of blue. The result was a succession of loose, elongated silhouettes in crisp sun-pleated chiffon, satin, and crepe, sometimes paired with an embroidered shell in layered taffeta trimmed with silk tassels, at other times with ecru trousers, and always worn with palazzo slippers in candy-color satin. \n",
      "Obviously, this woman is not headed to an office anytime soon. But if the clothes were intended to feel like a perpetual vacation, the collection also nodded to the empire that made the Agnelli lifestyle possible. The iconic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy, for example, was the concept behind the modernist Lingotto print that cropped up on a silk top, caftan, and long cotton skirt. Likewise, an Art Decoinflected cogs-and-gears print emerged on a chiffon pantsuit and under a veneer of transparent sequins on an evening gown. Elsewhere, the pair threw it into high gear to express movement, in rows of fringe in guipure lace and laser-cut hologram foil on a sleeveless tweed jacket. The one-off white parka with tufts of fil coupe was a bit of a wild ride, the designers allowed. Wisely, they stopped there. And anyway, it was aperitivo time.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tamara Mellon,Liana Satenstein,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Tamara Mellon, the cofounder and former CEO of Jimmy Choo, is a businesswoman with a flourishing eponymous line and the empire-touting uniform to match. It makes sense that she has a knack for translating that knuckle-under look into her collections. Her latest was a riff on the I am woman, hear me roar soundtrack of the 70s translated into body-skimming frocks, long and lean jumpsuits, and plenty of look-at-me shine.\n",
      "So what does the wardrobe of the fearless woman who has it all include? There were Amazonian Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman references; a hot pink maxi dress spliced in the midsection with a studded leather eyelet for a sliver of skin; and a thick bodice wrapped around the waist of a light dress for a cinched hourglass look.\n",
      "There was also a dash of Studio 54, with nods to other retro heroines of the night, like a slinky silver Lurex jumpsuit which could have been worn by Bianca Jagger. As for Mellons bold signature punch of animal prints, there was a bare-shoulder leopard-print frock complete with a thigh-skimming slit. Perhaps thinking of the woman on the go, Mellon referenced the optic white jumpsuits she designed for the crew of Blade, a helicopter service that flies passengers to the Hamptons. This time, she made them in dark denim, complete with a thick collar and a front zippera piece which ought to make the wearer feel like shes in the pilots seat.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tanya Taylor,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Tanya Taylora longtime proponent of color and cheerstood in all white at the end of a rainbow-filled room at the presentation of her Spring 2016 collection. The designer had enlisted the Minneapolis street artist Hot Tea (n Eric Rieger) to dangle thousands of pieces of colored yarn from the ceiling of the Swiss Institute, in Soho, for her show (he is the artist who yarn-bombed the Williamsburg Bridge in 2013, bedecking the pedestrian overpass into a Crayola-hued canopy). It was just the most beautiful thing, said Taylor, I wanted to bring it here.. Color ricocheted throughout the gallery spacethough, really, it would have anyway. Taylors designs reveled in hand-painted floral prints, checks, stripes, oversize knits woven through with braided Swarovski beading, boldly striped sundresses, and subtle safari detailing like that on a plaid seersucker pleated sundress that laced up the bodice.\n",
      "A first foray into denim was as light and feminine as the rest of the showing, boasting a Swiss dot effect across a military-esque anorak and lace laser-cut edges at the hems of cropped trousers. A swingy bell-sleeved frock was garden-party ready with green pleated cuffs and skirt, the sort of thing that one pops on and is immediately coaxed to twirl. Sure, texture was especially important this season for Taylor (who spent part of the summer in Kenya with the Clinton Foundation and came away from her Maasai cultural experience with an increased interest in beading), but the message of the collection was one of pretty, above all else. And you know what? There are far worse things to be for spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Telfar,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Telfar ranks among that rarefied group of mens labels on the utilitarian unisex front, where the question of gender hangs in the air but doesnt actually come into question. In fact, said designer Telfar Clemens before the show, and without a moments hesitation, I kind of started the whole thing. Which is to say, that particular shade of ambiguity is, at this point, beside the point. Its old hat, by now blurred, subverted, transcended. Plus, this is the labels 25th season, making it more of a seasoned grown-up than a scrappy young thing hell-bent on provocation.\n",
      "Born out of a streetwise functionality, Telfar aspires to exactly that. Subliminal branding, the designer asserted, nothing frivolous. Of course frivolity is in the eye of the beholder, and it remains to be seen what the beholder makes of off-the-shoulder tanks, dress shirts with missing sides, and halter tops whose spaghetti straps stretch over a mans articulated shoulders to a comical, cheeky effect. That and a pair of white daisy dukes practically shrink-wrapped over bulging thighs were among the only suggestions of old-school drag. Shoes straddled the fence between ballet flats and standard-issue Vans-style sneakers. As for branding, the name Telfar brazenly scrawled down the front of shirts in a lacy mesh and a TC logo stitched into every other piece werent exactly subliminal, but droll insider references to logomania never go unappreciated. \n",
      "Clemens also indulged in a fussy obsession with the numbers six and eight, wherein detailsparticularly cargo pocketsappeared no fewer than six or eight times on a given sleeve, belt loop, tag, and so on. Bizarre, to be sure, but it added to the collections curious, enigmatic allure. To say nothing of the backdrop, a trippy animation of the designer as avatar, mixed with allusions to the sponsor, White Castle. Product placement was never like this.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Temperley London,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"According to the Temperley London show notes laid out on attendees seats, the theme of Alice Temperleys latest collection was Havana. This was one of those occasions where, after the final dfil, you glanced again at those notes, considered what youd just seen on the runway, and thought, Nah. Its not that Temperley didnt reference Havana, or her private fantasy of Havana, in these clothes; its just that the Cuban motifs ran a distant second in importance to the shows real theme, which was embroidery.\n",
      "The heart of this collection was Temperleys heavily embroidered sundresses, and likewise embellished sundress-esque ensembles. Backed in crisp white or navy cotton, these pieces came in a variety of relaxed silhouettes and played host to a virtual fireworks display of floral and abstract embroidered patterns. Theyll be catnip on the sales floorindeed, women who dont usually gravitate to Temperley may find themselves tempted by the sundress looks. The designer deployed similar styles of embroidery on more formal, tulle-backed dresses and separates, as well.\n",
      "The look of the decorative embroidery was repeated on non-embroidered garments, too. Notably, Temperleys signature intarsia knits echoed the effect, as did some of the pieces in printed silk. The collection as a whole had a winning sense of easeeven the tailored looks shared in its languorous, tropical vacation tone, which was amplified by the romance of Temperleys occasional ruffles and flounces. The one quibble, really, was with the full-on evening looks: The combination of mirror sequins and tassel embroidery came off a touch de trop. Temperley did better with her more casual takes on the category, in particular the silk kimono gown in a tropical bird print. Here, at least, the show notes rang true: The dress was embroidery-free, and the Havana theme came through.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tess Giberson,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"At her presentation this afternoon, Tess Giberson admitted that her latest collection was really just an extension of the one shed designed for Resort. No complaints thereGibersons Resort collection was a rich yet concise interpretation of her experience visiting Walter Gropius's house in Massachusetts, and given that she had more to say about Gropiuss home, it was nice to find her revisiting the theme.\n",
      "As Giberson put it, her focus this time was on moments within the house, rather than its overarching aesthetic impact. With that in mind, she dilated on details such as the lacing on chairs or the fringes of a pillow, and expanded them into recurring motifs. The fringe came off particularly wellclean and un-hippieishwhile the lacing, used widely, made for some of the sexiest looks Giberson has ever produced, notably the double-slit skirt with a front panel of upholstery-like jacquard.\n",
      "Another winning extrapolation from chez Gropius was the deep blue watercolor striped silk, taken from a duvet, which Giberson made into a fantastic pieced-together slip dress. It looked like just the thing to wear on a hot and humid summer daya day, you might say, a lot like this one. Pieces in bone-white mesh were just as suited to swampy weather, while micro-pleated trousers, detailed with a canny ankle slit, or ribbed knit dresses with architectural cabling about the neckline, had a more trans-seasonal durability. As a whole, this collection continued the roll that Giberson has been onif she needs to continue making pilgrimages to the homes of great architects to keep it going, so be it.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Thakoon,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"For his Spring 2016 collection, Thakoon Panichgul filled his front row with It-girl artists (Langley Fox Hemingway, Phoebe Collings-James) and a smattering of actresses who like to align themselves with a certain artistic sensibility (Bella Heathcote, Christina Ricci, Jessica Alba), and really, who better than the very fetching and creatively inclined to celebrate what the designer called a vision of the New Bohemia? \n",
      "For Thakoon, that New Bohemia will be tie-dyed: From the bleached, lightweight denim to the slim silk slip dresses printed with a grunge grid to the crinkled chiffon, evidence of the hippie-favored coloring technique was everywhere on his runway. And what, the designer proposed, do bohemians love more than tie-dye? Wearing their pajamas, of course. Out came all manner of elegant attire for sleep enthusiasts: seemingly Julian Schnabelinspired chambray robe coats and scoop-hemmed micro-shorts (longer in the center, mimicking the hem of a sleep shirt) in pale shades of robins-egg blue with trim crimson piping or pure white terry cloth, all worn with immediately covetable, comely flat sandals that were halfway between a huarache and a gladiator. As for wearing your pajamas out on the town, when youre busy being creative, who has time for clothes? Well, actresses do, of course, and the most winning takeaways came in the sleekly crisp, bicolored broderie anglaise dressesjust the thing for a Cannes photo call. (Theres plenty of time to divulge your artistic leanings at the press conference straight after.)\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,The Elder Statesman,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Whats new in Greg Chaits hyper-luxe world of knits? Plenty. The Elder Statesman has amped up its offerings over the past couple of seasons, and for Spring there was a lot to love. For one thing, Chait worked with middle-weight yarn for the first time, turning out strong pieces like a pink cold-shoulder dress, and a gauzy, milk-white jumper. Elsewhere, sweatpants and a hoodie (as you might imagine, a far, decadent cry from the Champion of your adolescence) came printed all over in the softest of gradient rainbows.\n",
      "And what kind of comfort-hating monster could argue with propositions like black-and-white striped pull-on cashmere shorts, or a pastel hand-tie-dyed polo maxi dress in silk cashmere? Most importantly, Chaits clothes dont just feel goodthey look good. Take a woven Kenyan cotton with an irregular hand in a gorgeous mottled cream color, smashing in a pair of button-front trousers, or the plushest Italian cashmere as woven on a traditional backstrap loom in Central America. The latter came whipped into a dreamy top with softly fraying edges and a crocheted neckline, and the effect was as quietly polished as many a piece youd find at the high-end stores where The Elder Statesman is carried. And despite a laid-back brand image, that polish continues to distinguish the label. As Chait himself tells it: Theres a free-spiritedness, but were not hippies. Doubtful? Look no further than this seasons hero graphic tee, which read, simply: Hippies are ruining the world.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,The Row,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"It may not always look like it from the pictures, but the traditional order and format of shows has been thrown up in the air over the past year. At the luxury level, innumerable houses have decided to break the system and show when, where, and how they choose in order to reach the women they most want to engage, which has sent guests off on many a globe-trotting trip in pursuit of the fashion experience. Now The Row has done the same, not showing in its hometown, New York, but shifting to Paris, where, as Mary-Kate Olsen explained, many of our customers are, who we want to support. As you will see, tomorrow we are having a show in a chteau, 45 minutes outside Paris.\n",
      "Now, 45 minutes outside Paris, tantalizing as that sounds, does not fit the schedules of journalists who are doing the rounds of the shows every hour on the hour. So yesterday Mary-Kate and sister Ashley gave them a preview of what a more exclusive crowd will be seeing today.\n",
      "Its interesting to speculate how this collection will go down among a mixed European audience. In one way, The Row comes straight out of the American tradition of simplicity and pure lines, which goes back to the minimalism of the 80s and, even further, to principles of usefulness that have roots in the pioneering spirit. Though the Olsens showed a couple of draped chiffon minidresses and a sheer pleated two-piece here, their natural design instinct is to stay far away from the body and keep any sense of sexual display under wraps (there was, literally, a linen blanket coat) and feet grounded in slides. In a way, they are passive resisters to the idea of trends and fashiontheirs is work that comes under the heading of lifestyle, and a luxuriously serene one, too. Thats the point at which the philosophy is likely to connect most easily with a certain French tradition that also fundamentally rejects nouveau display. The Row isnt Herms, but maybe the Olsens can persuade their Euro audience that they share the same kind of sensibilities.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Theory,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"Back in the mid-90s, when Lisa Kulson was designing the first pairs of Theory pants, she mightve rolled her eyes at the high-water trousers that are the look of the moment now. We all probably would have. But fashion changes, and in its latest incarnation, Theory is in the business of responding to those shifts. I want women to think of us as a lifestyle brand, Kulson said under a cloudless sunset on the rooftop of the companys Meatpacking District headquarters. Were not the brand that made your first interview suit anymore. \n",
      "There were culottes and slouchy track pants and walking shorts. Polka dots and stripes featured in the mix. A suede tunic and coat nodded slightly at the 70s. And the off-the-shoulder silhouette thats suddenly everywhere turned up on both a top and a belted dress. But it was a navy pair of those high-water trousersschoolboy pants, is how Kulson described themthat got editors jazzed tonight. Throw in the matching navy blazer with brass buttons, and the whole suit would cost less than the pants alone at the fancy French house that did them first. Smart.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Thom Browne,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Its hard to know what to say about a collection like the one Thom Browne showed today. Not because theres nothing to write aboutindeed, theres so, so muchbut because Browne telegraphs his messages so overtly, theres not much room for interpretation. Browne is kind of a control freak, as designers go. You can see that in the fastidiousness of his collectionstheir silhouettes, their fabrications, their embellishments, their presentation. This is not a bad thing! But one of the things he wants to control is the meaning of his clothes. Which means his collections are about what theyre aboutno less, and (heres the rub) no more.\n",
      "In lieu of interpretation, theres description. And as usual, Brownes outing today was a feast for the eyes. He offered the audience a red herring in the set: It seemed, thanks to the feet sticking out from under the bare-bones house hed installed at the center of his runway, that there was a Wizard of Oz theme afoot. You might have validated that guess in the way the collection shifted, at one point, from all-grayscale looks to ones in color. But no. The real clues were in the desks inside the house the models sat at after concluding their deliberate dfil, and in their little jackets and pleated skirts, and in the Japonerie motifs inscribed on those tailored pieces, in elaborate and nearly trompe loeil ways. Browne was riffing on the aesthetic, and the mien, of Japanese schoolgirls. Cest tout.\n",
      "The decoration of Brownes looks was awe-inspiring, at the levels of both inventiveness and craft. The reiterated jackets and pleated skirts were collaged together or embroidered in ways to evoke Mount Fuji landscapes or patterns of cherry blossom or koi or Edo-style illustrations of geishas. Certain looks expanded the canvas of the clothes to include intarsia minks. Others, like the jaw-dropping ribbon-embroidered pastel sack jacket, gave a more abstract, watercolor effect. The techniques and the silhouettes varied, but a sense of uniformity prevaileda sense Browne imparted purposefully, of course. Theres undoubtedly a pair of trousers languishing in the sales collection associated with the one Browne showed on the catwalk, but the story Browne was telling at his show was emphatically one of jackets, pleated skirts, coordinated long button-downs worn as layering pieces, and frequently, a coat. The individual garments betrayed Brownes idiomatic sense of whimsy and wit, but as a whole, they towed a party line. The only exception was in the finale look, a radiantly iridescent confection of floor-length layered pleats. This was the schoolmarm, and by the time she emerged from backstage, Browne had more than made his point. Its a credit to his artistry that it was a pleasure to see it underlined.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Thomas Tait,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 21, 2015\",\"Thomas Taits show this afternoon was one of those odd outings that dont seem at first to be up to much, but then accrue in force as the looks accumulate. The impact of Taits latest collection generated from the ways the clothes forced your engagement, whether via the play of light on assertive, multicolor crystal embellishment, or the sound made by the jewelry that dangled off of certain pieces, jangling like cat bells. The most intriguing of Taits stratagems to command your attention were the porthole-like openings that decorated all manner of his garmentsthey were like little windows for Peeping Toms to peer through, and the more Tait reiterated the motif, the more you keyed into the collections compelling voyeuristic tone. Tait intended that reaction: As he explained backstage after the show, he wanted these clothes to create a sense of awkward intimacy. Job done.\n",
      "Others of Taits engaging effects were more subtle. He was playing quite a lot with texture here, notably in his ribbed knits and his terrific jeans, with their patches of super-shiny black patent leather; other looks pulled you in with their wabi-sabi appeal, like the frayed quilted jacket and coat, or a leather A-line skirt made from antique calfskin. Tait also used the skin in his strangest look, a heavy jumpsuit featuring a monumental pattern and exaggerated perforation down the sides. The piece was interesting on its own, but something of an outlier in the context of the rest of the show, which emphasized rather accessible silhouettes. Taits stovepipe skinny knit flares, for instance, ought to excite widespread demand. Ditto his ribbed knits, and the cuffed jeans and denim jacket. If Taits goal was to create intimacy, he nailed it in those most straightforward looks: The best way to be intimate with clothes, after all, is by wearing them.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Threeasfour,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Celebrating their 10th anniversary as a trio (Gabi Asfour, Angela Donhauser, and Adi Gil), minus one from an earlier incarnation, Threeasfours designers feel as tightly bound as ever, finishing each others sentences and moving about in lockstep. This year the brand is also celebrating the win of the National Design Award for Fashion Design from Cooper Hewitt, a prestigious honor backed by the First Ladyquite a different image from its other first lady, Bjrk.\n",
      "This is a new dawn for Threeasfour, and the designers wanted to demonstrate the newfound serenity, purity, and wearability, noted Gabi, with a higher message of unity for Spring. Were like the United Nations of fashion and art, added Adi. Against a large-scale fractal projection by video artist Alex Czetwertynski, the opening look set the just-futuristic-enough tone with its spirals of 3-D-printed digital lace and what the designers call topographic sandals. A series of finely cut and layered organza and voile pieces followedthe curvilinear, no-corners look thats become the label's signatureas well as a foray into mens with lapel-less jackets and coats. As always, textures were an integral part of the story; they ranged from waxed cotton and neoprene to milky latex and clear vinyl. Those fractals returned as prints as the palette of crisp white and shiny champagne gave way to deep earthy reds.\n",
      "In spite of its seasoned new maturity, Threeasfour can still deliver a drop-jaw moment, which here came as clusters of mica mineral sheets adorning the front of a dress and, in another look, chunks of various agate crystals linked together to form a bodice. The message was clear: Threeasfour is rock solid.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tia Cibani,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Designers often refer to a new collection as their baby, but at her presentation in her Chelsea town house today, Tia Cibani had the real thing sleeping upstairs. Five days ago, Cibani gave birth to a baby boy, the second of her two children.\n",
      "While the timing wasnt exactly convenient, Cibani made the most of it, graciously showing guests around her spacious, modern home and sneaking upstairs when she could. Plus, since Cibani was pregnant throughout the design process, there was a tidy logic to showing the collectionher other babyso close to giving birth.\n",
      "Cibani was inspired by lush and exotic landscapes in Brazil, and the dichotomy between the countrys vibrant, festive Samba culturewhich inspired the colorful brushstroke printand the serene beauty of Bahia, which influenced the monochromatic looks made from lightweight linen blends. Cibani had a lot of fun with texture this seasonfor example, mixing hand-embroidered tufted fabrics with raw silks and bouclwhich made the head-to-toe black and white looks the strongest. A collaboration with Mt. Washington Pottery that yielded long ceramic necklaces, like mini sculptures, emphasized the earthiness of the collection. \n",
      "Exotic locales aside, it was Cibanis pregnancy that helped inform the loose silhouettes and practical versatility of each piece: Standouts included a jumpsuit that came in black-and-white sueded cupro and had an adjustable wraparound tie, and a billowy ecru coat that was finished with white tape. Each look was styled with slip-on Birkenstock flats. \n",
      "Its like yoga clothes, but elevated, said Cibani, who, not inconsequentially, did a lot of prenatal yoga while pregnant. Overall, the feeling of the collection is more relaxed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tibi,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Kind of chilled out. Thats how designer Amy Smilovic described her latest outing, which was all about easesomething well no doubt be grateful for when the sticky days of summer (or, as in todays case, early fall) start rolling in again.\n",
      "As a rule, silhouettes were long and loose and mostly came in silk or cotton. Smilovic said she was inspired by recent trips to Miami and Malibu, which put her on a restorative kick and got her thinking about individuality. I think with the whole normcore thing people fall too much into uniforms, she said. I know Im craving to mix it up. For Smilovic that meant getting out of her comfort zone, working with elements that are almost tacky, and making them more refined. The once-loathed Bermuda short, which came in a variety of colors and materials including a surprising iridescent silk taffeta, were a mainstay of the collection. Color combinations, like forest green offset by a muted turquoise or sapphire paired with slate blue, were delightfully off-kilter. Smilovic is not a sequin person, but in the spirit of trying something new, she coated dresses, skirts, tops, and shorts in the shiny stufftweaking silhouettes and palette to ensure it stayed on the right side of tacky. For instance, on a pair of sequin shorts, the crotch and hem were dropped and the silhouette kept loose, to turn on its ear what you would imagine, when you think of a Miami woman in a sequin short. \n",
      "The sequins were employed to surprisingly sophisticated and beautiful effect on an ankle-grazing dress, which came in black and pale pink and interspersed strips of the sparkly material with sheer fabric in the same hue. But the dress that every fashion girl will want to wear come spring was the slinky slip dress in nude or oxblood, updated with a round neckline and thick straps. Smilovic often styles her own shows but this season she worked with Vanessa Traina Snow, and the stylists knack for minimalism can be seen in these unadorned slip dresses, which were worn without jewelry. Expect to see those and the billowy off-the-shoulder tops on the street next season.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tim Coppens,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"As seems to be de rigueur at the moment (see Raf Simons), Belgian designer Tim Coppens delved into the mist of his own adolescent psyche for Spring. Quite logically, the womens collectionshown in an empty storefront, where the lookbook was being shot, around the corner from his Soho studiois practically a mirror image of his menswear. After all, mens was his first calling, for which he won a CFDA Fashion Award last year, establishing the upstart among New York's fashion firmament.\n",
      "For 30-something Belgians, plunging into 90s-era adolescence necessarily means a revisit of clubland. Indeed, Coppens said he went to raves every weekend for five years. He translated that time definitely not wasted into melting mushroom prints on bowling-league jackets and sweatshirts, an amoeba print taken from his teenage notebook, and a fantastic Prince of Wales blue seersucker evocative of ballpoint doodles. Bomberssome cropped, others keeping their original mens proportionswere another highlight; they came baggy yet richly detailed with pockets, padding, and raw edges. Thick-rib tanks and Japanese denim skirts in darker shades lent another dose of not-too-retro appeal.\n",
      "Despite the rave-girl roots, traces of grown-up tailoring ran throughout in silky evening jackets and a floor-length diaphanous black tunic. Meanwhile, the sponsors of that CFDA Fashion Award, Swarovski, have clearly taken a shine to Coppens, supplying him with loads of beadspearly ones, not flashy rhinestones, in keeping with his minimalist tendencies.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Timo Weiland,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 18, 2015\",\"First and foremost, Timo Weilands clothes are meant to be wearable. Add flattering and comfortable to the list, too. Weiland and his codesigners, Donna Kang and Alan Eckstein, are very much a part of the New York fashion scene, but they arent about to endorse completely sheer dresses or high-concept frippery. That doesnt mean the clothes are boring, though; it seems the goal of every contemporary label is to master easy to-wear pieces that still feel special. Over the past few seasons, the three have gotten closer to that target by sharpening their focus and embracing a new, richer vision.\n",
      "For their Spring collection, they were inspired by the sweet, heady feeling of a new relationship. Its when you want to feel really pretty, but also comfortable, Kang explained. For example, their flowing skirts and dresses had to pass the cross-legged test, so you wouldnt think twice about sprawling out on the grass with your special someone. Little cutouts and bow-tie details also managed to be feminine but not cloying; the same was true of the ballet pink, navy, white, and olive color palette. Elsewhere, the trio relied on soft textures to inject a sense of romance: see the cable-knit sweater paired with a fraying tweed skirt, or a crisp, strapless poplin tunic layered over silk pants. Either of those looks would make an ideal starting point for girls hoping to embrace the seasons breezier, less structured sensibilities without going too far outside their comfort zone.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tod's,Alessandra Codinha,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"For her Spring 2016 collection, Alessandra Facchinetti decided to start a band. And not just any band, but the Traveling Wilburys of comely young creative talents: Fifteen strong personalities who dont follow the rules because they make their own, which is why they have such a following, said the show notes, and among them were Langley Fox, Chelsea Tyler, Quentin Jones, and Elizabeth Jagger, some of whom walked in the show, some of whom sat front row. (All, however, were present in portrait form via a series of Sonia Sieffshot images, which proudly hung in the entryway.) Beyond the rules, cried the show notes, and to that end, the proceedings began with a rockabilly strain: cropped trousers with paper-bag waists under Cry-Baby quiffs and paper-thin T-shirts that slipped off the shoulder, or leather jackets personalized with guitar-themed patchwork. Collared shirts had leather detailing, and long silk dresses were printed with vinyl records, or were not actually silk at all, rather delicately perforated pale shades of leather.\n",
      "The accessories had attitude, too: the sinuous wave bag (in an array of sizes, with the guitar straps slung over the shoulder or carried in hand), the iconic Gommino loafer, here boasting celestial silver adornments, safety pins, or bedazzled accents. A soft sneaker came, on occasion, fastened with saddlery detail, while a standout striped flat in an extended slipper style will prove just the thing for a spot of Im with the band cool when sported with jeans come spring. Bag closures and a glossy, perfect loafer sported a subtle, graphic new logoa pair of gilded Ts with overlapping stems, all pure form and linewhich, when considering a motif to demonstrate where the house has been and where its going, hit just the right note.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Toga,Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"A clay-hued backdrop, replete with a trio of eerily lit trees, set the naturalistic tone at Togas London Fashion Week runway debut. Under the banner of Petals, Minerals, Squiggles, designer Yasuko Furuta explored her complex woman with varying degrees of success. In line with the chaotic weather patterns of her adopted city of London (and back home in Tokyo), Furuta showed the kind of trans-seasonal daywear that is trending right now. Okay, so the heavy mesh white coat appliqud with a cascading nude ruffle wouldnt provide much cover in a downpour, but it was so pretty.\n",
      "Furuta has lost none of her inventive eye for detailing: bronze panels of fish-scale sequins and calcified fabrics had a distinct, mossy look. But occasionally things veered towards the chaoticwith one too many layers or colors on some of the pleated skirts that have become her signature. Still, there was much to lust after. An opulent take on suiting was sublimely inventivewith riding check, heavy satin, and tailored skirt-fronted tops with a ruffle-edgeworn over tapered trousers. These flourishes were Furutas subtle allusion to her theme, their shapes borrowed from the blue and yellow blooms in the on-set trees. The flowery feel was echoed in the bags toomost memorably on a drawstring mesh number with a petal-shaped red lacquered top. A bag for all seasons then, made with that complex woman in mind.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tomas Maier,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Tomas Maier spends part of the year in Miamiits where he opened his first store back in 2004. He knows sunglasses, and it shows in the new line of shades hes launching for Spring 2016. Stripped of excesses and more classic than trendy, the metal frame and acetate styles are a good metaphor for his brand, which stands for elegance and simplicity and prices that dont make your eyes roll back into your head. Theres enough of that elsewhere, no? His aviators and navigators are thin, their lenses flush with the frame, and very lightweight; they look more expensive than their under-$300 tag. Maier knows his way around a sundress, too. Hes got a trio of them in washed linen for Spring, their bright pink and red hues slightly faded in parts, like souvenirs from a summer holiday. Another dress in cotton with a zigzagging tie-dye motif is sure to have you dreaming about your next warm-weather getaway.\n",
      "As much as he likes palm trees (theyre printed on a denim dress, and flocked in velvet on the hem of a wrap skirt) and the chill, laid-back vibes they connote, its not all about the seaside at TM. Theres a softly tailored suit in poppy red silk this season and knit cardigans in shrunken proportions that city dwellers will snap up. And heres something youll be seeing a lot of on the streets next spring: the oversize, slightly Yves Saint Laurentin-the-seventies proportions of Maiers peasant blouses tucked into full wrap skirts.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tome,Chioma Nnadi,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Ramon Martin and Ryan Lobo have had some pretty impressive women pinned to Tomes mood board in seasons past, including Louise Bourgeois, Sylvia Plath, and Dorothy Parker to name a few. For Spring, though, their muse, the pioneering Australian visual artist Fiona Hall, fell a lot closer to home. Ryan and I discovered her before we knew each other, when we were both in high school, said Martin who, like his design partner, grew up Down Under. We saw her latest project at the Venice Biennale recently, and immersed ourselves in her work all over again. That powerful energy was reflected in the shows casting today: The lineup featured unexpected faces, such as veteran 90s models Claudia Mason and Esther de Jong.\n",
      "More familiar themes came through in the clothes themselves: Menswear stripes, deconstructed trenchcoats, and shirting are fast becoming Tome signatures. With Halls thought-provoking sardine can art as a starting point, the palette was somewhat subdued for a Spring collection. Painterly flourishes did appear in the form of a palm frond print on a lightweight coat with billowing sleeves, a leitmotif that was created by an artist friend in the labels Chelsea studio. There was an artisanal touch to the fish scale lace panels of one blush pink jacket too, and a white lace evening dress came peppered with crystals.\n",
      "Overall, the voluminous silhouette recalled the exuberance of a particular set of late-70s muses, and you could imagine Marie Helvin, Jerry Hall, or Pat Cleveland swirling on the dance floor of famed Parisian nightclub Le Sept in any of the ruffled peasant skirts and halter tops, even if the more layered, paper-bag belted looks would be tricky for mere mortals to pull off. Still, many of the piecesthose charming asymmetrical ruffled blouses in particularwill hold their own in a modern working wardrobe come the spring.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tommy Hilfiger,Chioma Nnadi,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Palm trees, sun-soaked beaches, rum punch . . . island life presents what is arguably the most alluring of chill situations. Tommy Hilfiger, who has been a regular visitor to the isle of Mustique for the past 30 years, would know. And today he took the fashion world on a mini tropical escape with his Spring 2016 show, where the runway was a boardwalk circumscribing a lagoon, complete with its own beach-bar shack. \n",
      "Of course its impossible to envision the Caribbean without thinking of its biggest cultural icon: Bob Marley. Beyond his musical legacy, his influence on fashion continues to reverberate. If the number of times his face has been printed on a T-shirt were counted in music sale units, his image would have gone platinum a thousand times over. \n",
      "There were no Bob shirts on the runway today. Instead, all the coolest things in his wardrobe were taken apart and redone in a youthful, playful way: knitted bucket hats in sunny colors, mesh vests done as floor-length cover-ups, and his signature soccer tracksuit rendered in burgundy suede and finished with crochet insets. And speaking of crochet, the boho textile was all over the collection, including the neckline of patchwork and billowing chiffon dresses. The crochet bathing suit, that linchpin of a 70s bohemian wardrobe, was re-created in several ways, too, and it was refreshing to see Gigi Hadid, a model whose gorgeous womanly body recalls the first wave of free-spirited travelers that came to Jamaica in the late 60s, striding down the runway in a string bikini. Reason enough to want to run off to a tropical island, or at least dress the part until you can.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Topshop Unique,Chioma Nnadi,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"The front row at Topshop Unique never fails to attract a gaggle of spirited British It girls, and today was no different, with the likes of Alexa Chung, Suki Waterhouse, and Poppy Delevingne all in attendance. And although the show notes described the muse of the season, in vague terms, as a beautiful British rebel who is first past the post at any social engagement, collectively the pretty young things in the audience embodied that spirit in spades.\n",
      "The collection started off with looks that borrowed from the classics of an English gents wardrobeperhaps because certain high-profile tomboys do abide by the motto Theres nothing sexier than a woman in a mans clothing. Its why cricket vests were peppered with holes that alluded to the skin, cinched with skinny patent leather belts and then layered over jumbo polka-dot skirts or ankle-nipping cigarette pants. The oversize pin-striped blazer, a city boy favorite, was redone as a minidress and worn with huge mismatched earrings, while traditional white button-down shirts were toughened up with leather.\n",
      "The most convincing pieces in the collection had a gentler sway about them, though, one that spoke to the soft, feminine mood thats in the air overall this season. The array of chiffon dressesone of which was covered in a charming strawberry patternhad an innocent garden-party feeling that was anything but fusty. With printed lingerie to match the motif of each diaphanous frock, the look presented a fresh answer to the naked dress conundrum, namely: What on earth do you wear underneath it? For party girls who just want to have fun, what solution could be more appealing than that?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tory Burch,Alessandra Codinha,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"For her Spring 2016 show, Tory Burch picked the bright and airy promenade of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as the location, citing beauty found in unexpected places . . . enhanced through time and nature as her inspiration. Her point was underlined by the large oxidized bronze structure that loomed at the rear of the runway. Yes, Burch seemed to say, even in the era of the new and now, some things really do get better with age. (Even fashion!) \n",
      "And to that end, out came some need-it-now spins on the trends of this summer and next: Blocky striped knit tops worn with a wide-leg, high-waisted trouser embroidered with a design that lay somewhere between an Aztec and a botanical diagram, brightly accented narrow guipure lace separates in periwinkle and saffron, fringed-tweed wrap skirts, tassel-hemmed linen trapeze tops, and embroidered folk blouses of Mexican and Romanian origin rendered in pale blue striped cotton shirting. All were done in the most utterly Tory way, which is to say both pretty and entirely prep-friendly, without any of the resulting bloodlessness. They were primed for sultry season promenades from Amagansett to the Amalfi Coast, paired with pumps and pearls or whatever next must-have sneaker the future has in store. (And for the latter, remember, here comes Tory Sport.) The closing section of caftans and skirts in gray perforated leather and iridescent fil coupe organza didnt seem to follow the same trackits hard to imagine them fitting in at East Coast havens like the Siasconset Casino or Maidstone Club. But the mod-inspired narrow tunics sported over flowing trousers and shorts (the version in khaki linen burlap edged in crystal embroidery provoking a mild sense of euphoria among showgoers planning future summer party outfits) would be equally successful on a woman of 16 or 60falling fully on the right side of history.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tracy Reese,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Tracy Reese has been associated with bright, retro-tinged floral prints; nipped-waist skirts; and sparkle for nearly 20 years. Shes the kind of designer who wears a tea-length taffeta dress with platform sandals and vintage earrings on a Tuesday afternoon. For Spring, her clothes were as glam and girly as ever, but there was a new, deconstructed ease. I always love shape, but I wanted to find a way to do that without so much structure, Reese explained backstage.\n",
      "One way she added dimension without hard lines was with layered textures: rough-cut swaths of lace over a shimmering slip; paper-thin PVC thrown over a brocade shift; a nubby linen trench dotted with crystals. Shine was a big message this season, and the light-catching, dance floorready pieces were easily the most exciting. Even a boxy sequin T-shirt had more attitude than the boldest, most eye-popping print. It felt effortless, like you could throw it on and get to the party within five minutes flat. Prints are Reeses signature, but it would be refreshing to see her explore texture and that undone quality a bit further; its more in line with what girls want to wear, too.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Trademark,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Its a good moment for Pookie Burch and Louisa Burchs Trademark. With Alessandro Micheles Gucci the current benchmark of cool, the sisters oddball quirk and slightly retro sensibility should find a whole new audience. Until now, Trademarks Soho outpost has operated as something of an insiders secret, the place editors and stylists go for a pair of high-rise floods or a vintage-look sweater. We expect the Spring collection, with its crinkle patent jacket and skirt, its tomato intarsia crewneck, and its slightly daffy see-through trench, will lure in fans of fashions new nerd-chic look.\n",
      "Those of you whove been watching Trademark since its late-2013 launch, however, will clock a distinct maturity to this lineup. Alongside some of the showier pieces, there were trim linen shirts, an easy-to-wear poplin dress with a micro-pleated sash, and smart trousers with subtle slits above the ankles. The Burches did cashmere for the first time this season, and their tube-trim, oversize V necks have a luxe hand. They also gave eveningwear a go; a taffeta dress with pliss shoulders and a wrap detail at the waist retained the casual polish of their more familiar daywear. Speaking of polished, the Trademark logo tape on the inside of shirt cuffs was a delicious little detail, as were the mini pom-poms tracing the sleeve seams on a pair of boatneck sweaters.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Trina Turk,Hayley Phelan,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"For Spring 2016, Trina Turk left her beloved native Californiaa place that has consistently provided her with inspirational fodderfor a fresh locale across the pond. Ive been to Capri a few times over the years, said Turk, and we realized wed never done a Mediterranean-inspired collection.\n",
      "The season begins on the Cte dAzurSaint-Tropezs iconic striped umbrellas inspired a handful of nautical items, while Cannes and Cap Ferrat informed some of the more city-appropriate looksbefore traveling down the coast to Italian vacation destinations like Positano and Capri. The influence of those seaside spots was apparent in the vibrant color palette and party frocks and beach cover-upsdone up in packable matte jersey and crochetthat had a little dolce vita to them.\n",
      "Pants continue to be big for the brand: Lace flares, silky culottes, and printed wide-leg versions provided ample two-legged alternatives for cocktail hour. The kick flare has been a huge hit for the label, and for Spring it comes in a crop, tooa style that was actually part of some of Turks earlier collections and that shes happy to see circle back. But the silhouette the designer is most excited about is a twist on the classic caftan dress: roomy and scarf-like but with spaghetti straps.\n",
      "With the 20th anniversary of the brand behind her, Turk is feeling even more confident in the labels core sensibility. This season, we thought: Lets just be more Trina Turk than ever, she said. That played out in bold floral patterns that mostly wound up on the right side of sixties and seventies kitsch. But despite the retro vibe, Turk is definitely a woman of the present: One print was sourced from contemporary illustrator Lisa Congdon, who Turk foundwhere else?on Instagram.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Trussardi,Luke Leitch,MILAN,\" September 27, 2015\",\"Gaia Trussardi was already deep into her research for this collection when she caught a National Geographic documentary about Australian writer Robyn Davidson. During the late 70s Davidson spent nine months traversing Western Australia accompanied only by four camels and a dog (who didnt make it); her ensuing account of the adventure, Tracks, was a hitthink Wild, without the relationship problems. It represented the moods and characteristics of a woman I was thinking about, said Trussardi. The need for a contact with nature. How nature can fill you up.\n",
      "The result was a collection intended to appear sandblasted, wind-whipped, and faded by the sun. Long-skirted jackets and pleated full pants in neutral striped herringbone linen were left unfinished and tattered at the edges. The ribboned bib on a blue shirt was ruffled as if by force. Shirtsmore like caftanswere delivered ankle-length, split to the hip, and worn as layers under jackets or as a piece of outerwear. The beaded prints were created from blown-up images of religious tribal masks and the models all wore Virgin Mary necklaces.\n",
      "The palette swerved from neutral to pastel with debatable success; these rough-hewn, heavy-textured loose pieces rather disagreed with the prissiness of soft pink and apricot. Trussardi has complained that when it comes to using leather in her collections, she is damned if she does (so obvious!) and if she doesnt (why didnt she?!). Today she went with wrap split skirts and a fine raspberry duster jacket in double-layered suede and yellow jerkin-like calfskin crop tops, as well as a long gown with a half-moon panel that was cut too narrow to walk easily in. The oversize stitching detail on her penultimate look, a black suit, was a nod to Trussardis glove-making DNA.\n",
      "Overall, this collection was neither a triumph nor a catastrophe; that blue look was pretty good, the tailoring fine (cummerbunds apart), and there was plenty to catch the eye of liberal-leaning acai eaters in search of clothes that signal urbane rusticity and luxurious roughness.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,TSE,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"At first glance it was hard to believe Tina Lutzs new collection for TSE was inspired by Rastafarians. The label is known for golf courseappropriate twin sets, after all. But Lutz used to frequent Jamaica with her husband, where they hung out in the mountains, made friends with locals, and bonded over jerk chicken and curried goat. Its just so different from anything you know, she explained. Dont expect the typical red, green, and yellow color palette, though. Lutzs mood board was covered in photos from Beth Lessers 2008 book Dancehall: The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture, which documented Rastafarian style in the early 80s. Their look was heavy on crisp whites and pastels, but it was really all in the details: pointelle stitching, skinny stripes, and clever seam details took sweaters and polos to a much more eccentric place.\n",
      "Lutz merged those retro vibes with TSEs complex knit techniques, like a pointelle cashmere sweater printed over the top with a custom digital pattern and shot through with feeder stripes. Considering TSE is first and foremost a cashmere brand, her challenge was to make those knits superlight so you could actually wear them on the beach. She also mixed in billowy voile pants, crisp shirting, and a standout raffia jacket for good measure. The jacket felt intentionally raw and unfinished, but the hazy stripes were actually sprayed on with an ink jet. It summed up TSEs current vision quite succinctly: On one hand, the brand is artisanal and low-tech with a rich history, but it's also completely up to date with modern technology.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Tsumori Chisato,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"For the first time, instead of a runway show, Tsumori Chisato opted to stage a presentation. The cozier format forced her to self-edit, and the final cut totaled roughly half what she normally shows. This couldnt have been easy for the persistently playful Japanese designer, who dives deep into her themes and doesnt resurface until she has exhausted every visual metaphor. The underwater world offers no shortage of source material, all conducive to Tsumorphing: Highlights included an orange neoprene flipper handbag, metallic seaweed floating along an organza blouse, a blue tent dress bubbling with broderie anglaise, and an airy ivory number covered in delicate frond-like forms (bookmark this one if youre planning an offbeat beach wedding). As usual, she represented herself in the collection; suited up in scuba gear, her alter ego paused at the edge of fraying hot pants and swam around the base of a wavy striped maxi dress. The oddest depiction showed her delivering a golden eye to a submerged sleeping giant. Indeed, soaking up these details would have been difficult on the runway; either youd focus on the drawings and unique finishings, or try to determine whether the clothes were wearablewhich they were. Invariably, Chisato sticks to simple dress silhouettes, easy outerwear, and basic shapes that allow the body to breathe (one exception: a Grecian-style gown with an unusual drop-waist drawstring).\n",
      "The models paused long enough for the eye to drift downward, discovering pearls trapped in clear platforms, like Air Max soles embedded with treasures. Chisato made sure to point them out to Kenzo Takada, who took in the 28 looks by her side. He listened intently the entire time, smiling as she spun her stories.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Ulla Johnson,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Ulla Johnson is the rare contemporary designer whose clothes tell a vivid story but also resonate with real-life customers. Her biggest stockist is Barneys New York, but the brand is expanding rapidly into top luxury boutiquesplus its all over Instagram, which means new shoppers are discovering it every day. That commercial success has made it possible for Johnson to really delve into her aesthetic, which she describes as a tapestry of cultures. That means theres everything from Peruvian ikat prints to Indian embroidery and touches of Western fringe, but its all elevated for city-dwelling women like Johnson herself.\n",
      "The designer frequently travels to Peru to develop her luxe knitwear, but a recent trip to Japan actually made her see the beauty in being home. I really just fell in love with America again, she explained. Theres a huge Japanese market for vintage Levis and bandanas, but Johnson opted for a mix of her own nostalgic references: macram and crochet details inspired by Santa Fe; a color palette of faded rose, taupe, and marigold sourced from Richard Diebenkorn paintings; icy-blue denim seen on wide-leg jeans and a ruffled dress; and a pristine white Victorian lace gown. Perhaps the collection hung together so well because the clothes felt genuine and familiarweve all owned a peasant dress or chunky cardigan at some point. The idea of revisiting those classic piecesupdated with rich textures and more flattering silhouettesfeels just as fresh as trying whatever the brand-new trend is.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Undercover,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"Jun Takahashis Undercover collections usually have a message, but you dont have to get his deeper meanings to appreciate what he does. After his show at the Cirque dHiver today, Takahashi talked about righteous aggression. The people need to be strong, he said. His backstage sentiments jibed with a soundtrack that featured a live version of the Rolling Stoness song for the have-nots, Salt of the Earth.\n",
      "Takahashi came at his insurrectionary message both subtly and less so. To start, he mashed up jackets and coats with backpacks to give his tailoring a ready-for-battle attitude. There were zip-up pockets front and back and on the hips; some jackets were so transformed that their fronts were mere straps covering bare breasts. It couldve been a silly exercise, but Takahashi is a clever tailor, with a wicked sense of humor. In another sign hes down with the people, he co-opted low-culture concert T-shirts for high-fashion purposes. The Stoness young faces stared out from inside the four suits of a card deck on a miniskirt and at the hems of pants. For every have-not, theres a have. Takahashi turned playing-card royals into a print on blazers with the kings and queens eyes blacked out like the donts on a dos-and-donts list. \n",
      "Royalty is a motif Takahashi has used before to equally witty effect, but the vibe was slightly more incendiary this time around. Oversize floral prints couldve been exploding bombs. Perhaps not. Either way, his tweaked and twisted sportswear is easy to get behind.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Valentin Yudashkin,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Russian designer Valentin Yudashkin wanted to take a break from black, a decision that could have been motivated by any number of influences outside the fashion realm, but probably just boiled down to newness. Thing is, he does black very well and was finding his groove from a balance of precise tailoring and sexy sportswear. Surely some more recently arrived clients might soon be wishing he indulged his darker side a bit longer before pivoting sharply back to color.\n",
      "But for all the early-80s evocations, Yudashkins focus remained forward: He used neoprene and technical mesh inserts to update suiting, day dresses, and a versatile motorcycle jacket, and ornamented eveningwear with acrylic, geometric embellishments. Yudashkin mentioned being inspired by contemporary art this season and singled out painter Piotr Uklanski as the strongest influence. Indeed, the drip print that seeped down a jumpsuit or splashed forth in sequins on a hot, disco-worthy number nodded directly to the Polish artist. However, the designer was at his most original when he showed a weightless pastel dress topped with a bouncy neon green blouson; this felt fresh and not overworked. On the few occasions when he did seem to overwork a designthe final gowns that swirled wildly in a riot of magenta and red taffeta and tullehe did so with the conviction that this represents glamour today. If you do it from the heart, the customers will follow, he said backstage, of his vibrant collection. He sounded too sincere to object.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Valentino,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking deeply about Africa when they were designing for Spring, and not on a whim. For more than a year, tens of thousands of refugees from Senegal, Nigeria, Eritrea, Mali, Gambia, and elsewhere have been making the harrowing journey across the Mediterranean to southern Italy. Packed into unseaworthy vessels, many are dying in appalling circumstances before they reach shore, a humanitarian crisis Italy has been dealing with by patrolling the seas, saving survivors, and giving them sanctuary. As in Germany, which has been receiving hundreds of thousands fleeing from the war in Syria, there has been a backlash against the new arrivals from some quarters. And this is what the Valentino designers want to counteract. We probably feel that the greatest privilege in doing our work is that fashion can give a message, said Chiuri. We think every person coming here is an individual, and we can show that we can improve ourselves by understanding other cultures.\n",
      "The message, added Piccioli, is tolerance. And the beauty that comes out of cross-cultural expression.\n",
      "On appearances, you would not necessarily guess at the very real and fraught situation running in the background of this serene and heartfelt Valentino collection, but the research, and the lengths the designers had gone to to educate themselves, resulted in some gorgeous fusions between Italian and African traditions. They met in the textiles and the way the Roman influences Chiuri and Piccioli had used in their couture show segued into tribal treatmentsthe strips of leather that began as a gladiator reference became studded; the Roman sandals gained carved ebony heels; the pagan necklaces of their former show now appeared in white ceramic, suggesting abstracted teeth or shells; and the house expertise in embroidery produced tiny beaded Masai-derived patterns and bold peacock feather trims.\n",
      "Both designers pointed out that their respectful borrowings are hardly new; they are part of a history of Western assimilation that goes back to Picasso and Braques embrace of African art in the 1920s, which, Chiuri said, was the birth of modernism in art. It came over as most modern in this show when it was at its most subtle, as in the black dress embellished with multiple layers of suede fringing, or in the manipulation of tie-dye patterns used as a camouflage-like material for summer utility jackets and cargo pants. In the end, though, while customers may not even notice the roots of the simple, breezy cotton printed Valentino dresses they are buying, the important thing is that the designers have used this opportunity to spell out where they stand on an issue very close to home. It will definitely be heard in Italy. Fashion is a frivolous and joyful thing, but that doesnt prevent some of the people who are making it from having inquiring minds and a public conscience.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vanessa Bruno,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Vanessa Brunos flagship store had been propped with sleek, modular planter boxes and bowls piled with lemons and pomegranates to create a lush ambiance for her South Americaninfluenced collection. Never mind the fact that pomegranates originated in the Middle East, this outing was less about geographical accuracy than an exploration of artisanal techniques. Bruno, in fact, said she began the season by thinking about a wardrobe for a hot weather getaway and ended up refining the idea so that the clothes would be easily packable without sacrificing style. She doubled down on crochet, inflecting it with Parisian flair, not just in form (a graphic striped bra top) but also in application (paired with crisp gauchos).\n",
      "Dresses eschewed volume for eye-catching finesse, from grosgrain detailing to sunset hues. Indeed, when Bruno pointed to a dress featuring a laced crochet bodice and loosely pleated skirt as being most emblematic of the season, one could envision unpacking it, along with the raffia sandals and turquoise-accented jewelry, and instantly entering into vacation mode. As for concerns about the visibly creased cotton, which might give the impression of being stuffed carelessly into a suitcase, it actually contained a barely visible metal thread that acts as a memory to maintain shape. It reinforced how Bruno was going for soign, not starched.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vanessa Seward,Nicole Phelps,PARIS,\" October 6, 2015\",\"Vanessa Seward opened her store on the Rue dAlger last month, and from the looks of the crowd at her show today, its been a busy place. Amid other sightings, two high-profile Parisians turned up in the same tweed blazer from her first collection for Fall in identical white jeans and almost identical cashmere sweaters. Its puzzling why so few designers put pieces on the runway that could step right off it onto the street. Thats why what Sewards doing with her new line is a hit. The fantasy is the reality. \n",
      "This afternoons show started with a clever voice-over created by her husband, music producer Bertrand Burgalat, in which Sewards impressions of French women got the Auto-Tune treatment: They have this whole effortless thing that I really admire, she says over the electronic music. Backstage she added, Its my homage to the charm of French women. Seward is no slouch in the personal style department, of course. She had a cosmopolitan upbringing, moving first to London and then to Paris from her native Argentina, and she imbued her new collection with some of that international flavor, cinching Argentine gaucho belts over a couple of dresses and adding a few nods to YSL in Marrakech into the mix. The silvery lam was more about time travel, back to the glam 70s. It looked great on a maxi dress. But she didnt shy away from doing smart basics  la A.P.C., with whom shes partnered on the label, either. Seward makes a great trench, and there was new denim in the form of an A-line button-front skirt that she paired with a T-shirt that read Vanessas Way. Has a nice ring to it, doesnt it?\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vera Wang,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 15, 2015\",\"I love the mix between schoolteacher andshowgirl, Vera Wang said backstage. Theres real life, then theres fantasy life. Thats potent material; theres a reason that Luis BuuelsBelle de Jour,which was a loose reference point here, became the classic it did. Indeed, dichotomy has long defined Wangs ready-to-wear. Masculine and feminine, tailoring and flou. Shes fashions punk ballerina, a world-famous bridal designer who wears only black.\n",
      "Duality was again the order of the day for her new Spring collection, but the results were somewhat mixed. Tailored coats topped only the barest of bandeaux and high-waisted briefs. More quizzical was a structured vest that turned to reveal it was a dickey of sorts, completely bare in back. And the practical applications of a loose V-neck tank cropped below the bust in black mink were hard to discern. Wang knows her way around a mash-up, but there was a disconnect between her fancy evening dresses and the athletic mesh bras underneath that she never quite resolved.\n",
      "Piece by piece she did beautiful work. Black ostrich plumes added romance to a sleeveless blazer in nude techno gazar, chrome and gold pailletteembroidered dresses were eye-catching, and Wang, the wedding dress queen, cuts a smart pair of high-waisted cropped trousers. Reality, not fantasy, came out on top.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Veronica Beard,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 16, 2015\",\"New York Fashion Week is drawing to a close, and while weve still got the rest of the month to see collections in London, Milan, and Paris, New York City is where the trends take shape for contemporary labels. One major theme for the mid-range set was a simpler, more relaxed approach to getting dressed. Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard are best known for layering, particularly with their sharply tailored jackets and removable dickeys, which create the illusion of wearing a cable-knit turtleneck or Perfecto jacket underneath.\n",
      "But Spring presented a new focus that goes way beyond blazers. Miami was the Beards starting point, and models with wet, slicked-back hair stood in front of giant palm fronds wearing crisp white separates, soft suits, and breezy dresses. Its supposed to feel like they just jumped out of the pool and threw these clothes on, Swanson Beard explained. That translated to a looser, less rigid approach to tailoring: Even the sharpest pin-striped jacket was done in a soft piqu, and clingy silk dresses were unstructured, save for a drawstring waist or a row of ruched buttons on the side. \n",
      "Of course, real-life wearability is a big factor when youre stocked in department stores, and while a few looks felt a bit formulaic, like a red off-the-shoulder dress, others appeared more womanly than what some of the designers peers are doing. And for girls looking to upgrade their dickey collection, there was a brand-new style to try here: lapel dickeys, which were slimmer and added just a little extra dimension.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Veronique Branquinho,Alessandra Codinha,PARIS,\" October 5, 2015\",\"At Veronique Branquinhos Spring 2016 show today at the Htel dvreux, models wore long, flowing pleated dresses in muted tones of cream, black, and rainbow pastels (for a Victorian-meetsBurning Man effect), gauzy blindfolds, and occasionally trailed macram fringe, which extended from the neckline down to the ankle. It would not have been a stretch to imagine them with candlesticks in hand, too, a series of nightgown-clad Lady Macbeths coursing through the halls of the castle with some mind-warping affairs underway.\n",
      "There was a fair bit of deconstruction at hand, if not actual Shakespearean madness: well-tailored jackets and vests with the stitching picked out; tasseled, sheer layers with visible corsetry underneath; an array of utterly bewildering transparently backed trousers, exposing long, white Elizabethan-style undershorts worn underneath. Sheer tulle blouses possessed vaguely modesty-protecting ruffles on the breast, while suit trousers occasionally boasted a thick, white elastic waistband printed with the designers name  la 80s Calvin Klein. A medieval-looking print of flora and fauna was pleated on some frocks to expose the bounty when the dress was in movement, but most successful were the shoes: chunkily heeled brogues and smoking slippers with gently sloping toes in black and shagreen, red lizard, and creamy white patent.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vronique Leroy,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"If Vronique Leroys program notes told one storyan intellectual young woman defining sexy on her own termsthe designer told another backstage after the show. For Spring, she tried to test the point at which seemingly mismatched outfits gain new allure. She did this primarily by pushing and pulling colors, proportions, and materials just enough that the outcome remained a tad shy of awry. Look 13 is a prime example: the crinkly white and sky blue striped silk blouson and wrap skirt paired with a black camisole and saffron belt strikes as simultaneously fresh and odd. The final passage made the same impact, as if the rounded sleeves, wide pants, and mix of check, knit mesh, and lace delivered the sartorial equivalent of a jolie laide.\n",
      "One imagines that Leroy spent much time calibrating the elements, whether at an early design stage or the very end in styling. But the coquettish black dress that repeated the same mix of mesh and lace was the opposite of overthought. A long-sleeved version in white and navy turned the trusty marinire into something to lust after. For all the possible traps, Leroy really only slipped up with the accessories (wide, asymmetric belts; oversize, droopy hoops; openwork booties), which werent problematic in design as much as overusedalthough maybe this was part of the exercise. And by the end, it became clear that the low-key professional women who have supported her for decades would not need to opt into this mismatched business to find their key looks. But if they feel compelled to venture slightly outside their comfort zone, Leroy has them covered.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Versace,Sarah Mower,MILAN,\" September 25, 2015\",\"Just when you're feeling down, and a little bit battered and numbed by fashion in general, and perhaps thinking you've lost sight of the point of it all, along comes Donatella Versace to put it to rights. Before we start talking about the way her collection grabbed so many women in parts of themselves they never imagined Versace could reacheven those who like a boyish pant suit and flatswe should refer you to her soundtrack. It was not just an added-on musical theme, but the massively inclusive, confidence-generating Transition by Violet and friends. You'll have to listen to it, but long story short: It's a call to all women to stop listening to our inner demons and outer detractors, and just get rid of everything which stops us from doing what we really want. It was made for International Women's Day, said Donatella Versace, backstage. And when I heard it, I was so sure of myself. I wanted to challenge myself, to do something strong. \n",
      "Which is surely the main reason she came up with the image of combat which marched through her showa reflection of the all-too-many wars which are raging now, maybe, but also of the resolution of her battle with herself to throw away self-imposed restraints, and just get on with making Versace relevant. \n",
      "Relevant? We must now move toward thinking about what that oft-repeated, never-defined, and rather terrifying word means. Perhaps relevance is emotionally felt in fashion when its clear that its not just for one type of very thin, very young white girl; when it also represents on behalf of color, booty, and admirable women who are just a weensy bit more experienced than eighteen. And apart from that? When it comes to design, relevance in fashion also relates to where on earth the clothes are actually supposed to be worn. Can many people find things to put on daily? Or are we all going to continue to believe in the fiction that living in today's world is one long cocktail reception?\n",
      "Donatella Versace addressed all that by showing a collection which never ditched the beloved character of her family's house, but concentrated mostly on varying shades of daywear, shown on an inclusive cast of characters. The opening looks, all legs, with khaki tailored jackets cinched with webbing belts over micro shorts, above vertiginous platforms, were no surprise. What came next was: The Versace house print gone wild in punchy green camouflage tailored suits with slouchy boy-cut pants, collaged into knits and sweatshirts and swinging along in the form of backpacksall (amaze!) walking out on clogs and sporty slides. \n",
      "It would not be Versace without an injection of sexinessa quality which has been so out of fashion recently that many designers appear terrified of it. This time, Donatella Versace did show some of the requisite chiffon, fluttery, spilt-to-the-thigh gowns, but the little, curvy, slashed and knotted dresses which came before them were far more interesting, shown as they were on girls striding out on what amounted to decorated clogs. It was a triumph which turned boredom into excitement and alienation into a visceral desire to shop. Whatever forces Donatella Versace was fighting to reach this new point of clarity, she won.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Versus Versace,Sarah Mower,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"As of now, Versus Versace as you see it here is already on sale onlineeven as the after-party, with the models and invited kids from far and wide, is still going on in a basement venue in London. With Anthony Vaccarello at the helm as creative director, Donatella Versace has turned Versus into a show-now, buy-now, wear-tomorrow collection, a shortcut to fashion availability which no one else in the designer world has yet quite fully pulled off. \n",
      "But what will people be clicking on to purchase when they wake up tomorrow? Interesting to speculate; Vacarello is a fluent new-generation-channeler of the pulse of Versace. He gets the house codesthe lion-head medallions, the legginess, the body-conscious cutout-and-drape shapes, the tailoring. One thing he has not yet delved into is the color of Versacehes a confirmed fan of black in his own collection, and that hue dominated the Versus runway too. However, for the first time there were prints, botanical florals, and fruit patterns, plus such things as printed denim bomber jackets and jeans. It made for an impressively wide range for people all over the world to pick from, and plenty of opportunity for stocking up ahead of year-end parties.\n",
      "Still, in fashion, the eye always tends to go toward the outliers. In this case, that would be the simplest daywear look: a black leather shirt over tailored, hip-riding masculine pants. Maybe thats about as far from a stereotypical Versace look as can be imaginedand it stood out, in a good way. Meanwhile, who should be wearing something very similar backstage? Why, Donatella herself, in a narrow pair of black boy-pants and a black T-shirt. Surprise!\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vetements,Sarah Mower,PARIS,\" October 1, 2015\",\"The entity that goes under the name Vetements has caused quite a quake through fashionbottom-up, from nowhere. Just whenby looking at mainstream corporate luxury-goods normsit seemed that cool was dead and buried and nothing alternative could ever again survive, along came a couple of brothers, Demna and Guram Gvasalia, and their collective of friends, to prove skeptics wrong. Theres no faking the concrete truth of that. The visible evidence of their breakout is in the number of Vetements oversized blazers and giant MA-1 jackets, recycled firefighter sweaters, Antwerpen slogan shirts, and, especially, the flower-printed tea dresses with sweatshirting inserts that are being worn around the shows. Nobody seems to have consulted each other on this: They just went to shops, women and men alike; tried on the Vetements stuff; loved the way it made them look and feel; and impulsively paid up.\n",
      "Thats why those impulsive ones, plus a large contingent of the professionally curious, enthusiastically headed to Belleville today, to what turned out to be a large Chinese restaurant, to see the Vetements follow-up for Spring. The audience was not to be disappointed.\n",
      "The buzz and energy in that cheap and cheerful establishment, the freakishly beautiful club of the young and the strong who modeled, and the wildly impressive clothes they were wearing had all the makings of an unforgettable fashion landmark. At top speed,Demna Gvasalia and his co-conspirators confirmed everything their following likes about their off-kilter, elegant, giant-jacketed tailoring and clunky romantic dresses, and then bettered it all. There were argyle knits under sober menswear suits, sexy sawn-off skirts with Vetements-labeled thigh boots under coats, brilliant flashes of neon yellow and toxic green, striped mens shirts with superlong trailing cuffs, and corset T-shirts.\n",
      "Then came the dresses, in a stunning number of new, colorful, and punchy-sophisticated ideas. There were loose versions of prairie-flower prints with matching trailing coats, a green Lurex yoked smock, a navy polka-dot dress anchored on a black satin slip, and one outstanding mauve velvet dress cut to cling and slither across the body.\n",
      "And that was far from all. After most of the crowd had filtered out into the streets, Demna Gvasalia explained, Theres something in the collection which means a lot to everyone whos worked on itlike those rose-printed plastic tablecloths we made into aprons and dresses were an ode to my grandmother. Weve worked really hard on developing more jeans, too, and leather. The point is that the Vetements collective has a lot of pooled talent and experience to call upon. Idealistic as they are, they havent started as naive lambs to the slaughter of the industry. One core ally is the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova Adam, who walked last in the show. Other people have worked silently with them, moonlighting from jobs elsewhere. Demna Gvasalia himself learned the ropes at Maison Martin Margiela, before setting up Vetements and getting on with proving that there can be a different way of doing things. Apart from their stylistic insights into what people really want to wear, it feels like the beginning of something else, tooperhaps something like the power of niceness and friendship in an industry that could do with a lot more of that.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,VFiles,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"Perhaps more than ever, tonights VFiles show pushed fashion decency to its very limit, then went further. In front of an adoring, rambunctious crowd of colorfully attired demimonde-dwellers bobbing to dubstep, courtesy of DJ A-Trak, not to mention all who watched on Periscope and tweeted furiously, five young designers or collectives took the runway with abandon. They were the chosen ones, as selected online by an international voting public. Were breaking stereotypes, said founder Julie-Anne Quay backstage. These brave kids, who are 22 and under, represent the next generation of tastemakers, the new youth culture.\n",
      "The most compelling of the bunch, conceptually speaking, was Feng Chen Wang. Born in Beijing and fresh out of fashion college in Britain, she described the very somber basis for her collection, learning of her fathers cancer diagnosis last year and taking a deep interest in the process of recovery, even observing the surgery firsthand in the operating room. As bleak as it sounds, and rather contrary to her chirpy demeanor, she made the most of the bad situation, crafting clothes bursting with outsized organ shapes and zippers evoking incisions. Some models wore blood bags that dripped a black liquid (not blood) into plastic tubes spelling out the words Love and Life.\n",
      "David Ferreira, based in London, brought together his favorite film, Orlando, and Empress Dowager Cixi of nineteenth-century China. As it happened, some of the pieces ended up looking remarkably similar to Rihannas yellow stunner, by Guo Pei, at this years Met Gala. (Incidentally, Rihanna has sported previous VFiles designers to various events.) Ferreira said he combined elements of European couture with historical Chinese dress. He mentioned foot-binding, but it was surely only coincidence that one model tumbled twice, ripping off her shoes each time and continuing barefoot to thunderous applause. \n",
      "Design duo Namilia (Nan Li and Emilia Pfohl) sent out elaborate inflatables spanning the entire width of the runway and covered in naughty words and symbolsall highly unwearable, to be sure, but also very entertaining and well received. Backstage they cited the power of Instagram and the rebellious spirit of todays pop stars.\n",
      "The New York trio Moses Gauntlett Cheng was the most trans-centric of the group, mixing and matching assorted genders and identities that, along with a self-assured sashay, recalled the 80s drag balls from the film Paris Is Burning. Japanese designerand graduate of both Central Saint Martins and ParsonsKozaburo Akasaka also sought inspiration from an earlier decade, but his was conjured from the other side of the planet, Tokyo. His pieces were hand-stitched and patched together from scraps of denim, leather, and other assorted tatters, complete with cowboy boots. One imagines his post-apocalyptic, Wild West vision was all the rage in his hometown at the end of the last millennium. When the grand finale took placea parade of all the models in all the looksthe effect was nothing short of Fellini-esque. And get this: Most of it either already is or will soon be available to buy online. It really is a new day.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Victor Alfaro,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 9, 2015\",\"However I touch things, they always look very polished. I just cant help it. So noted comeback kid Victor Alfaro after his show today, and indeed, the collection he presented proved his point. The greatest part of the appeal of these clothes was their immaculateness, discovered in the perfect body-skimming fit of a bias-cut silk gown or the piping detail on a white cotton jumpsuit or, of course, in any of Alfaros signature knits. Of the latter, the most eye-catching pieces were the dressy sweaters embellished with ribbon embroidery or dangling bugle beads, or patchworked together with lace; the items that stuck with you, however, were the ones that summoned a more monumental effect.\n",
      "Alfaro has a talent for the statuesque, which he deployed here in (seemingly) simple silk gowns with graphic windowpane insets, terrific long-line jumpsuits and likewise lean cashmere gilets, and various voluminous pants. Tee-shaped dresses and quilted cargo pants introduced a sportier tone, but they still had a certain Georgia OKeeffe-wandering-the-New-Mexico-desert vibe, one that was ramified by garments such as a floor-length knit cape. (Ellsworth Kelly, meanwhile, provided the punch of yellow and orange in the collections palette.) The aura of self-possession in Alfaros clothes will, alongside his knits, remake his name in timethis 90s wunderkind seems to be taking the long view and making clothes not so much for this, or any particular, moment, but ones built to last.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Victoria Beckham,Sarah Mower,NEW YORK,\" September 13, 2015\",\"Im a sponge. That might seem a very odd, existential quote to come from the mouth of the distinctly un-blob-like Victoria Beckham, but she was using it as a figure of speech to account for the design ideas she put into her Spring collectionfeelings she says she just picked up in passing on her nonstop travels with work and family. Ive lived in L.A., we have the show here in New York, and now obviously were back in London, she said backstage, so I guess Ive figured it out from that. There are subliminal things in here, like the surf prints, but this collection is more about attitude and just making things fresh and carefree.\n",
      "Perhaps the best way to judge Beckhams fluid, just-above-the-ankle midi lengths, swing dresses, and flats is to compare them to what she was producing at the very beginning of her career as a designer, i.e., fitted hourglass silhouettes, tiny short dresses, and eveningwear, all with towering heels. That is now firmly a thing of the past. There was nothing on the runway that looked even remotely cocktail or red carpet in the old sense, but times have changed. Where there once might have been sculpted, corseted bustiers, now there is crinkled duchesse satin suspended from gathered necklines, and where once there had been stiletto platforms, here were backless loafers. The distance traveled can definitely be measured in a much more grown-up idea of what sophisticated fashion is to the kind of women who inhabit, or would like to move into, Victoria Beckhams world. The clothes read as expensive, with a luxurious, creamy heft and swish about them, exuding a wealthy confidence that says, I have achieved the perfect life, but I dont need to try too hard to show that off to you.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,\"Victoria, Victoria Beckham\",Aimee Farrell,LONDON,\" September 22, 2015\",\"With her second flagship store set to open its doors in Hong Kong, Victoria Beckham finds herself at the helm of a brand thats an increasingly global proposition. Still, after hosting a dinner for London Fashion Week (and a quick call to check in on her kids) she found time to walk through the Spring 2016 offerings from her little sister line, Victoria, Victoria Beckham.\n",
      "It started when we were in Marrakech for Davids birthday, she said of the springboard for this season. We visited the Jardin Majorelle, and I was really inspired by all the tiles and the color. This theme was most pronounced in the signature Majorelle Blue bloom prints that had the edifying effect of Matisses cutouts. These folksy florals were reworked more delicately in off-white lace on a simple crepe shift and a neat macram sweater. A laser-cut dress in intense orange delivered a kaleidoscopic kick, with a level of detailing that had a mainline finish.\n",
      "The silhouette was largely loose and relaxed, with voluminous-backed cape dresses that chimed with the brands playful, modern tone. Ive been wearing this huge gray dress all around New York, said Beckham of the starting point for these billowing shapes. It felt so summery and light. It made me realize that wearing volume really can be flattering.\n",
      "Merging VVB with her denim line last season has apparently brought out Beckhams experimental side. Weve pushed the denim with more techniques, cuts, and washes, she said, pointing to a pair of eyelet-flecked white tapered jeans. Among these new shapes were some frayed-hem culottes, complete with a belt, that are sure to be on summer wish lists. Happily, there was still space in the collection for her best-selling flares and skinnys. \n",
      "The real draw here for VVBs younger customer is in the expanded presence of entry-level pieces. A delicious series of T-shirts, some contenders for eveningwear, echoed the primary palette with leather or fuzzy-felt finish flowers. Im excited about the T-shirts, said the designer, eyeing a white tee with contrast black collar in an oversize pop print. Theyre a chance to reach out to people of varying budgets. I want all women to be able to experience the brand.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vika Gazinskaya,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 7, 2015\",\"A collection starring crochet and pleated slacks might intimidate all but the most intrepid fashion enthusiast (retailers included). But leave it to Russian designer Vika Gazinskaya to turn challenging ideas into charming clothes. She did this by stripping away the corresponding clichs: Her Spring outing was neither stuck in the 80s nor weighed down with craft. Rather, she relied on brushed cotton and crisp silk as her two blank slates from which to experiment with volume, color, and the placement of colorful appliqus, some backed with functioning pockets.\n",
      "Its just too bad that the collection is handicapped by photos that flatten the dimension of her ample silhouettes and fail to capture the humble appeal of the crochet (the flower placket and two-tone scalloped hem among the standouts). Photos also dont do justice to the rigor of Gazinskayas constructionthose sculpturally fronted tops and feminine trenches do not assume their shapes by accident. Fortunately, she has a sixth styling sense, aware that pairing the trousers with an embellished T-shirt or silk camisole is as important at entry level (price and aesthetic) as the crochet bib over the folksy dress is at the advanced. Gazinskaya remains her own most convincing muse, so it will be interesting to see how soon she wears Look 6, with its odd color pairing of chocolate and peanut butter. In the meantime, toward the end of the walk-through, she lifted up a full skirt to expose a crinoline. Also under there: her enduring joie de vivre.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vionnet,Luke Leitch,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"Adventuress is a deliciously double-edged title that was used in 19th- and early-20th-century England to describe invariably hot women who were outside the bounds of society and apparently set on their insertion into it. From the niggles, titters, and whispers that Goga Ashkenazithe commodities-pumped proprietor of Vionnetsometimes attracts, one suspects that a century ago she would have been labeled an adventuress. Today, though, it seems like what it is: snobbery, pure and simple. \n",
      "Ashkenazis project at Vionnet is sincere if sometimes touched by naivety. Today, fueled by the insertion of Hussein Chalayan into her team, she presented a collection that convincingly tipped its hat to Madame Vionnet herselfcheck Pinterest, yallplus incorporated Vionnets own classical source code. Beneath the breathy wind of mood-board romanticismspanning from Peter Doigs canoe paintings to Byrons She Walks in Beautythis collection was at its essence a group of bias-cut shades-of-nude column dresses with flanks of pliss and sometimes iffy paneling, jazzed up with odd handmaiden flying buttresses, weighed down by sewn-in stones.\n",
      "There were unfortunate diversions: A sheer paneled black dress featured a crisscross of relief cutely taken from an upskirt photograph of the Eiffel Tower, but it was still a too-sheer black dress. But the sublimations of Doric relief and go-to nymph adornment onto half-caped trouser suits with sneaker-meets-gladiator sandals represented the whisper of a Platonically touched ideal spanning then and now. Titter ye not: Vionnet is okay.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Visvim,Lee Carter,NEW YORK,\" September 12, 2015\",\"Its always a head-spinning experience to go through a new Visvim collection with its designer, Hiroki Nakamura. Not only are his collections sprawling, encompassing mens as well as a newer womens line (WMV), but most pieces have unusual and distinct origins that beg to be told and heard. And Nakamura, a gifted raconteur, is more than happy to share their stories.\n",
      "Essentially, Visvim begins and ends with vintage fabric. But heres the thing: Nothing is actually vintage. Rather, each piece is created anew in the spirit of vintage, usually the result of a long and international chain of artisanal workmanship. Nakamura described how, for example, one sweater began as organic Italian cotton, which was then hand-knitted in Peru before being finished in France. There were also mens shoes woven out of bits of raffia in Morocco, but which, because the craftsmen there werent experienced with a particular shade of blue, required a team of Japanese dye specialists to assist. Dyeing is otherwise done in Japan, as a rule, as in a series of lightweight cotton dresses with an all-over checkerboard pattern made by brushing dye over rice resin in a technique called katazome. That innocuous-looking plaid suit jacket? Its made entirely out of paper pulp, for extra breathability.\n",
      "Aside from his obsession with vintage fabrics, Nakamura is also a collector of found objects or flea-market finds, things he picks up on his travels and packs into the five or six suitcases he says he takes with him on every trip. He assembled a display of these items for the showing today: a jar of shells he found on a beach in Montauk that he drew as a shell print for the collection; a parasol from Alsace that inspired him to make an indigo-dyed umbrella; a jewelry box from the 1900s that he liked for its brass studs; Geta slippers whose once-bright velvet faded long ago. On the topic of shoesupon which the company was founded and which still whip up enormous cult-like zealsome important news: first, a new sneaker style called the Roland Jogger is launching, and second, the famed FBT moccasin that started it all now comes with a protective leather overlay, by popular demand.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vivienne Tam,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Vivienne Tam built her business on lavish evening gowns that fuse her Chinese heritage with modern technology, but todays show threw a wrench in that formula. Spring was all about casual, streetwise clothes for both girls and guys; it was Tams first time casting male models in her show. Traveling between New York, Hong Kong, and Paris, I noticed people on the streets were very androgynous, Tam explained before the show. Girls were wearing mens clothes, and men were wearing more feminine things. Sure, you could chalk it up to the impact Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic, and (most famously) Caitlyn Jenner have had on pop culture this year. But transgender isnt a trend, and Tam included lots of additional context, too, like the oft-referenced Chinese Art Deco period, which saw women playing with masculine style for the first time. \n",
      "The show opened with a relaxed, strapless gray striped ensemble that captured Tams new laid-back approach. It was closely followed by a few different takes on shirting, like a flouncy wrap dress and a mens charcoal jumpsuit with a ruffle down the front. A lot of the best pieces, however, were the ones that could pass for unisex, like the satin souvenir jacketsalready a big trend for falland tech-mesh bombers. For the red carpet, Tam showed playful mahjong-inspired dresses that were undeniably fun; the game was introduced in the U.S. during the Art Deco period. Intricate dresses with embroidered rows of tiles felt whimsical, but still a lot more restrained than the gilded, heavily embellished dresses Tam showed in the past.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vivienne Westwood Red Label,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 20, 2015\",\"Can you reasonably rage against the machine when you are a highly profitable cog in it? This is an obvious paradox inherent in Dame Vivienne Westwoods policy of using her shows as a podium from which to preach about the iniquities of mass consumerism and fossil fuel dependence. Her valiant pitch at squaring that circle is the exhortation to buy less things that are better made and last longer, a sentiment that, while impossible to disagree with, doesnt quite carry when delivered in the backstage hubbub immediately before a show of seasonal fashion. Nonetheless, this evenings Vivienne Westwood Red Label carnival was a corker.\n",
      "Held in a basement space grippingly advertised outside as an Alien Sex Club, the runway was overlooked by a balcony on which gathered a band of paper-crowned model/protestors holding banners hostile to politicians and shale gas extraction. The soundtrack was, quite frankly, hellisha cacophony of sirens and garble through which occasionally stirring dialogue could be heard, including the weary line: Fashion is ridiculous, a pathetic parody of what it used to be. After the last look walked, the protesters descended behind Westwood. Everyone in the room dutifully took pictures, then realized they had no signal. The most piquant contradiction in this show was how incompatible the collection seemed with the rhetoric around it. Because while the styling was absolutely maverickall smeared robber-mask eyes and sleep-in-a-tree hairthere is no other way to describe the clothes than with the C-word: conservative.\n",
      "Prettily ruched frocksfrocks!in lace came layered with sweet scarlet florals. Knee-length tea dresses were delicately cut and spattered with Marimekko-touched patterns. Layered embroideries in manor-house interior reliefs were layered around their wearers like professionally piped icing. Yes, there was the odd proselytizing button or T-shirt emblazoned with a meaningful carbon footprint, but subtract theseand perhaps alter some of the more laissez-bare necklinesand you could imagine the Duchess of Cambridge or Samantha Cameron appropriately shaking hands with the CEO of Shell in a great many of these looks. It was as if the Sex Pistols were covering Maroon 5and it was good.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Vivienne Westwood,Maya Singer,PARIS,\" October 3, 2015\",\"Vivienne Westwood has made a habit of using her fashion shows as a platform for activism. This season, she was championing two related causes. In a note left for attendees at their seats, she invited them to join her at the Peoples March for Climate, Justice and Jobs in London on November 29, just ahead of the start of the Paris climate talks. On the runway, meanwhile, she paid homage to Venice, a city that, perhaps due to climate change, is sinking even faster than it was before. Venice is a good theme for Westwoodher shows tend to have a certain carnival atmosphere in their mix of the decadent and the louche. Youd have expected a Vivienne Westwood Save Venice! collection to feature quite a few of her signature evening dresses, with their bouffant skirts and baroque swirls of sculptural draping.\n",
      "But Westwood took another tack. Instead of cocktail looks, she emphasized rather plainspoken daywear silhouettes, shown on male as well as female models, in a gesture that read less political than as an homage to the Venetian tradition of the masque. The cross-dressing theme was echoed as well in the array of tailored items, in particular suits that looked oversize and mannish, with trousers cut to appear as though theyd been cinched up spontaneously to fit a womans smaller frame. That was one of Westwoods dramatic flourishes; others included poufed sleeves and hardware and crystal embellishment sewn onto jackets. As far as theatrics went, however, Westwood saved her fire for a few spectacular pieces, such as the extra-long coats worn high overhead, which created a spookily huge silhouette, and a bodysuit of sequin-dripping net that conjured a very fancy birdcage. Needless to say, those looks had quite an impact on the runway. But the strongest ones at todays show were much more straightforwardWestwood still drapes a mean dress, and her fluid silk frocks, bunched artfully in the front, made for a fine addition to her substantial oeuvre. They were dressy, those dresses, but had such a casual mien that you could imagine wearing one to march alongside the designer in London next month.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Wendy Nichol,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Are you a good witch or a bad witch? And furthermore, who cares about that old adage when Wendy Nichol keeps making clothes that so neatly and lushly encompass both? For Spring, the accessories-maven-cum-cult-ready-to-wear-favorite has struck on her most winning balance since debuting her clothes back in 2011. If threads of Victoriana once were a chief characteristic of her offerings, then recent seasons have seen the scales tip toward a more general, more languid sort of loveliness.\n",
      "Even the pieces marked most starkly by a sense of drama were easy to envision as appealing to many different types of bewitching women. Nichols floor-grazing collarless duster, for example, is beloved by everyone from Beyonc to Saudi princesses, and here came in a lustrous, shadow-striped ivory silk, with a leather tasseled belt. Elsewhere, a showstopping Solstiss lace gown and generously fringed bustier in buttery black leather looked like you might just run the world in them.\n",
      "Still, not all of us clock in as royalty of one sort or another on the day-to-day, so Nichol has savvily begun rounding out her offerings with more traditionally wearable separates. See a pair of wide-leg pants, complete with a wafting overlay of chiffon, or a cropped tank top and tee. The designers impeccable fabrications, all whipped up in her New York studio, lend even those simplest of styles (including her utterly louche bias-cut skinny scarves) a feeling thats markedly special. Best was a softly pleated circle skirt in pieced-togethernot printedblack and white stripes. All inky at first glance, but take a step back and it flashed a snowy-white undersidea bit naughty, and very, very nice.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Wes Gordon,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Wes Gordon is one of a handful of young designers who have found themselves in a tricky position vis--vis their clientele. Gordon serves what once was known as an uptown customerexcept that those women are just as likely, these days, to be found downtown, or evenheavens to Betsyin Brooklyn, and their shifting sense of style reflects the change in geography. They want clothes that are luxurious and polished and feminine, and that will serve at the formal occasions they are called upon to attend, but they also want clothes that are functional and unfussy, with a dont-mess-with-me attitude and perhaps a hint of the offbeat. This is a difficult brief. Gordon, for his part, fulfilled it capably last season, finding ways to elevate a grungy vibe without losing track of its essential brooding spirit.  \n",
      "This time out, Gordon took a similar tack. The silhouettes were girlier and the palette less moody and imposingthis was a Spring collection, after allbut the grunge inflection remained firmly in place. Gordon noted that he had photos of ultimate slacker girl-crush Winona Ryder posted up all over his studio as he prepped this collectionand at moments, in looks like the silk or plaid cotton dresses with stripes of cobwebby lace sewn on in seemingly amateurish fashion, he did summon Ryders characteristic demure dishevelment. Elsewhere, the message was more muddled. There were great seam-detailed looks done in matter-of-fact charcoal linen, and need-it-now marled knits, which, when paired with the buttery calfskin pieces, provided the collection with much of its warmth. There were other nice touches, too, like the tunics with cutout shoulders, or the flourishes of iridescent chiffon. Overall, though, Gordons effort this season to fuse upscale and edge led him down too many byways, and the collection never really came into focus. It could have used fewer stories, better told.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Whit,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 10, 2015\",\"Colors and prints tend to have a short lifespan in the fashion cycle, so when they happen to be your signatures, keeping them fresh is key. One way Whit designer Whitney Pozgay manages to do that each season is by enlisting artists to collaborate on her prints, from New York artist Adam Handler to her own husband, Parker Argote, who has painted many of her signature motifs over the years. The final results are crafty and eclectic, not trendy or loud (read: no digital prints here). For Spring, Pozgay wanted to illustrate the contrast of hot air balloons over the African savannahan image packed with opposites like hard and soft, artificial and natural, old and new. Striking shades of poppy and lemon popped against ivory, sand, and black on straight midi skirts, boxy shift dresses, and off-the-shoulder blouses, many of which were stamped with a series of tribal prints. Each one was handmade, like the blocky, geometric print that was initially laid out with sport tape, or the sweet, slightly retro African lily print. We wanted to reappropriate the tribal theme in a more artful way, Pozgay explained. She tapped Handlerwho recently showed his work at the Fred Torres Galleryto paint a giraffe across the entire front of a crisp shirtdress. \n",
      "Elsewhere, the idea of tribal clothing was subtler and, in some ways, already engrained in the Whit vernacular: Mixed prints, wrap details, and voluminous shapes are hallmarks of traditional African style, but theyre also the elements Pozgay always goes back to. Its all the things we love mashed together, she said. Its crisp and wearable, and there are plays on proportion, like bell sleeves with a skinny skirt, but its still forward and fun.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Wolk Morais,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" November 10, 2015\",\"Ruffian designers Brian Wolk and Claude Morais packed up the car for Los Angeles a year and a half ago, part of the wave of westward-leaning New Yorkers. Last night, they presented their second collection for their new eponymous label, Wolk Morais, in West Hollywood, and the show was a testament to how quickly theyve taken to their adopted home and put down roots. Elizabeth Stewart, who dresses Cate Blanchett, Amanda Seyfried, Julia Roberts, and other celebs, styled the show, and her teenaged kids and their friends not only modeled in it, but also inspired the clothes. \n",
      "Back in New York City, Wolk and Morais used to be known for ladylike flounces and frills, and couture-level fabrications. Theyve rejiggered the formula at their new label, with raw denim, utility jumpsuits, and sweatshirts, and an occasional pair of tights for the guys who walked the show. This is the right move for them. Fashion is headed in a looser, less-fancy direction at the moment, for one, and for another, the raw denim looked really good, especially a jumper-dress worn over a silk blouse. Elsewhere, Wolk and Morais had fun with print, creating a digitized floral that turned up small and large on everything from those hoodie sweatshirts to cocktail numbers and event dresses. They didnt leave their dressy instincts entirely behind when they left New York. That makes sense, too. There are too many starlets and red carpets to count in their new hometown. With Stewart for a fairy godmother, as they call her, some of those up-and-coming actresses, and perhaps some very-well-established ones, too, could find their way into Wolk Moraiss frocks. From there, its not far into stores.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Yang Li,Dan Thawley,PARIS,\" September 30, 2015\",\"The idea of the outsider looking in has always fascinated Yang Li, a designer whose rise to the upper echelons of Paris fashion came via Beijing; Perth, Australia; London; and Antwerp. Its surprising, then, to note that his Spring heroine isnt concerned with the divide of East versus West but rather a more fictive trip down memory lanethat of a punk in exile returning to her bourgeois past, prompted to scour her grandmothers closet and piece together a new identity.\n",
      "That romantic metamorphosis unfolded from the get-go, as Look 1 was comprised of a delicate jacquard bra top and an organza-trained cream trenchcoat that topped mannish pants and monk-strap derbies. It immediately engaged a sensual rub of mid-century prettiness with Lis codes of postpunk music, sharp tailoring, and tough, unfinished eveningwear. What followed was a repetitive expansion of that framework, as the designer riffed on generous pant volumes, fluid-sliced camisoles and polo tops, and the jarring grunge effect of silk gingham layered with leather coats or ball skirts cut in crimson inkblot florals.\n",
      "Though a trio of patchwork tailored coats recalled Lis time under Raf Simons in Antwerp, he twisted their familiarity with an artisanal touch, as bold lyrics by the neo-folk group Swans were traced in hand-stitched gothic calligraphy. Like an intuitive balancing act, their demure counterparts followed suitsack-back, bracelet-sleeved opera coats in duchesse satin or taffetacouture-like creations that held their own among the complexity of viscose trenchcoats or tailored boucl jackets peeling open with sinuous zips. Sprinkled throughout, the belts of those trenches were worn as fetishist buckle scarvesclasped at the neck with silver brooches picked out in studs and sprays of flora. They were the totems of youth and establishment, cast side by side with arresting, irreverent beauty.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Yeezy,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 17, 2015\",\"Kanye West only confirmed he was putting on a show last Saturday when his invitations went out, but save for his friend Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy presentation, Yeezy was the event of the week. Outside beforehand, camera phonewielding fans swarmed the VIP door, angling for a picture of Drake, Lorde, and Jaden Smith. Just as many people were trying to scoot past security without a ticket at the main entrance. Once inside, the setting was comparatively serene, but only until those celebrities and the designers familyKim, North, Khlo, Kourtney, and Kendallstarted to take their front row seats; from then on, it was pretty much pandemonium. \n",
      "West worked with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft for the second season going. Like last time, street-cast models mixed with professional ones, and Kylie Jenner, the designers sister-in-law, put in a cameo. Unlike last time, West and Beecroft made the military metaphor literal, enlisting real drill sergeants who called out formations. Platinum-blond, fair-skinned models came first and marched to the end of the runway to pose for pictures. As the show progressed, the clothes shaded from beiges and taupes to browns and blacks, and the models hair and skin tone got darker, with the darkest models and clothing coming last. At the finale they arrayed themselves front to back, white to black.\n",
      "In a year in which racial injustice has occupied the headlines, it was a potent tableau, seemingly loaded with meaning. But if West was making a statement about inequality in America, he chose not to address it with this reporter. When asked about the casting, he said, Its just a painting, just using clothing as a canvas of proportion and color.  \n",
      "Were not sure if we buy that, but if West wants to put the focus on his fashion, not his politics, then well play along. The Yeezy vibe is a consistent one. Sweatshirts, leggings, outerwear, and boots remain the backbone of the collection. Its still monochrome head-to-toe, and its still essentially unisex. Spring does feel less shaggy than its predecessor, but its just as streetwise. If West makes good on his promise at the VMAs last month and does indeed run for President in 2020, hes going to have to get his campaign trail suits somewhere else.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Yeohlee,Emily Farra,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Math isnt one of the things you hear fashion editors talk about while they wait for runway shows to start. (Were right-brained people!) But Yeohlee Teng likes to think about numbers and geometry when she designs her clothes. At first glance, Tengs Spring collection was as simple as it getsall button-down shirts, scoop-neck T-shirt dresses, and pencil skirtsbut most pieces were designed with equations in mind. Pockets were placed in perfect 6-by-6-inch squares, and a spongy, bonded wool coat was cut from a giant circle. The models even stood on a 36-by-36-by-12-inch platform in the middle of her tucked-away 29th Street store. \n",
      "Teng also considered how clothes fill up the negative space around the bodysee the rounded ecru coat with pouf sleeves, which concealed the models every curve, or the sheer filigree shirts, which seemed to take up no space at all. Of course, the average shopper likely wont consider those factors when she grabs a Yeohlee parka off the rack, but the emphasis on numbers and form did lend a sense of order to the designers sometimes vague aesthetic.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Yigal Azroul,Nick Remsen,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Its about going from step to step, said Yigal Azroul of Spring, and showing that progression. What came of this transient mind-set was a collection that started with light (a transparent silk-twill dress with printed brushstrokes) and bowed with dramasee the all-black finale knockout with jabot lacing, neck to navel. Yet, despite the range, Azroul managed to keep his trademark cool by making sure his silhouettes never veered too far afield; these clothes all have appeal, and widespread at that.\n",
      "The best piece here was a motorcycle jacket that fell somewhere in the middle of Azrouls evolutionary story, its body rendered in thick, architectural leather, and its sleeves spun of misty chiffon embroidered with sprigs and ferns. Smart and effortless, with a spin. Later, Azroul tried colorful floral appliqus over jet lace, but he was strongest when keeping the concept simpler: A black-and-white guipure turtleneck turned heads, and any number of PYTs might find wardrobe bliss in a little dove-gray jacket and steely filigree dress. The teal and black dresses were also eye-catchingAzroul mentioned he could see Gwyneth Paltrow wearing one. (Agreed.) With a clean, matte beauty look (slicked-backed ponies and the faintest breath of blush), this was a pleasant evolution, indeed.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Yohji Yamamoto,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 2, 2015\",\"To witness a Yohji Yamamoto creation make its way down the runway is to wonder whether he arrived at it by accident or by deliberate design. Likewise the show itself, which today took place in the gloriously gilded gallery at City Hall, where the acoustics amplified the silence between what may or may not have been a live music performance. Turns out, Yamamoto supplied the recording, a one-man-jam that consisted of him singing Come into the shadows. \n",
      "Backstage, he confirmed that the improvisational styling of the wrapped, knotted, and displaced looks that set the shows tone was very much on purpose. Each time you wear, its different, he explained. The clothes were also different in that he wasnt suffocating the models with an impenetrable concept. Gradually, however, he switched into a higher, historical gear; hoop skirts seemed like theyd survived a tornado, and excess fabric spilled out from the tops of corsets. The denim tubes assembled into a skirt were Yamamotos interpretation of an 18th century crinoline that he found in a rare book on European lingerie. Only someone capable of reading Yamamotos mind would have connected the dots between these exquisitely tattered looks, the makeshift parasols and the all-terrain Adidas sneaker boots to arrive at his stance on climate change. Earth is angry, the summer is too hot and the rain becomes a storm. And in hot times, we need underwear in the streets, he said.\n",
      "Environmental message aside, the cumulative effect was a collection that skewed cool. This, Yamamoto declared, was also intentional: My brand needs young customers. At midnight, he will turn 72 years young, which likely explains the invitation boasting a photo of his aging hands. The girl who closed the show wearing a stiffly ruffled, roughed-up dress in fire engine red was equipped with a camera as part of a documentary being made about the designer. Yamamoto bearing all seems unimaginable: he communicates via rogue corset boning, randomly painted pantaloons and shapeless shrouds. But then this momenta genuine resurgencewont last forever.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zac Posen,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Its been a big week for Zac Posen. First came his diffusion line presentation, which featured an LED dress he made in partnership with Google. After that, his debut collection for Brooks Brothers. Tonight, in front of Amy Schumer, Christina Hendricks, Jennifer Hudson, and Bella Thorne, he took over Grand Centrals Vanderbilt Hall with a signature collection that was surprisingly free of many of his signatures. Beforehand, Posen said, Its important for us to keep it exciting. Weve had so much red carpet, it got to the point that I wanted to give a proposition for my friends and customers during the day.\n",
      "Enter a black cotton sundress that, paired with Christian Louboutin skimmers and a top-handle bag, conjured St.-Tropez in the 60s. It was positively breezy, and while the clothes didnt remain quite that low-key, when he inevitably turned his eye to evening, Posen approached it in a new way. Without any of the engineered, hourglass seaming hes famous for, his long dresses had a more relaxed sensibility. For surface interest, he tacked floating seams with bugle beads. One hundred percent harder than sewing a normal seam, he said, fingering a tuxedo that featured the couture technique. \n",
      "A guipure lace dress with a stiff yoke that extended a couple of inches above the models shoulders failed to evoke the ease Posen was after, and at the other end of the spectrum, a hand-crocheted top and skirt looked too crafty. But missteps aside, Posen did a commendable job here of extrapolating on his strengths and growing his repertoire. A special shout-out for a staple seam camisole and matching pants. It may not be fancy enough for the Emmys, but one of those ladies should snap up the outfit for an after-party.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,ZAC Zac Posen,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 8, 2015\",\"Zac Posen, like so many, has Cali on the brain. The states beachy joie de vivre and the active lifestyle its residents are known for were the designers jumping-off points this season for his little sister brand ZAC Zac Posen. Those notions came through in pieces like sportif dresses with aerodynamic-looking cutouts or a black shorts set, which was kitted out with a peplum in honeycomb mesh. Mismatched leopard-and-palm suiting had a whiff of the Venice boardwalk about it (albeit through the designers urbane lens), while he pointed to a maxi with a frond print as being particularly Coachella-ready. It was, in an elevated way, and this reference seemed telling in a collection that was both a little sweeter and a little younger than some of Posens recent offerings. Case in point: separates in candy-colored stripes and a bubble-hem raincoat. Elsewhere, there was a standout seventies-inspired swingy pink top trimmed in marabou felt ready-made for flouncing onto chaise longues or swanning about poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Posen wouldnt have been wrong if he had injected a bit of that same drama into some of his other daywear, but the evening options here were breezier than ever. A pink satin trapeze gown and another in pale aqua with tie-neck detailing were both easy and elegant. With results like these, wed say some California dreaming suits Posen just fine.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zadig & Voltaire,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 7, 2015\",\"For Spring, Zadig & Voltaires creative director, Cecilia Bnstrm, did not attempt to do new, just to do better. Its the type of corporate soul-searching approach that a brand is wise to consider after dabbling in various directions, unsure which one will stick. There was a laundry list of familiar Zadig & Voltaire items on view in the subterranean showroom today: fringed suede, breezy white cotton dresses, alt-cowboy motifs, embroidered denim, and a crocheted sweater shrug in alpaca. Masculine and feminine codes seesawed within single items (biker boots with lace laces), and lingerie pieces crossed over from night to day without constraint. \n",
      "Without a doubt, the hero piece this season was the return of the leather dungarees, an early brand best seller. This latest iteration is being offered as a supple lambskin skirt, and the internal team should be prepared to run production on this every season. For now, though, Bnstrm indicated how the girl who ties an army shirt around the waist of her gold-flecked handkerchief dress embodied the brands unwavering homage to rock chicks, whether in Paris or halfway around the world. The candy-color suitcall it Haribo Tagada pinkmay have been the outlier among a largely neutral offering. Then again, the logo T-shirts consisted of three inspirational words: Happy, Peace, and Love. And for the time being, though not indefinitely, that would be inspiration enough.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zero + Maria Cornejo,Nicole Phelps,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"How to make it new again. That, to make a long story short, is the designers conundrum. Maria Cornejo was feeling it particularly acutely this season, with a whole new team in her studio. But rather than stick to old formulasthatd be the easy thing to doshe opted to shake them up. Backstage she reported that all of the fabrics were developed in house. Its all exclusive, but its a lot of work, she said. Work that paid off. \n",
      "In recent years, Cornejo has leaned heavily on prints. They havent failed her yet, but this season she had only one, an oversize brushstroke motif that brightened up a trio of dresses and a pajama set. Here, more often that not, she was experimenting with rich texture, from the cubic weave (looks just like it sounds) of a white sundress with wide grosgrain straps, to the fringy fil coup of a tunic worn over pants, to the pliss leather of an off-the-shoulder top and matching skirt. Pleats: Huge in 2016. \n",
      "Cornejos research into material culminated in a dress and coat in black-on-white cubist embroidery, the graphic, gridded precision of which was atypical of the designer, who tends to favor curves over hard edges. It wasnt just her fabrics that got a rethink, either. The long, almost to-the-ankles silhouette was new for her too. Shes particularly keen on the swagger of below-the-knee coats and coat vests. Once more, Cornejo worked with Bolivian artisans on hand-knits. A white sweater that slouched sexily off the shoulders looked like a bona fide hit.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zimmermann,Nick Remsen,NEW YORK,\" September 11, 2015\",\"Down Under, theres a book, published in 1894, called Seven Little Australians. Its about a family of seven children, and all of the rebelling that ensues. They wreaked havoc on [their father] . . . back then, everything was very stitched up, says Nicky Zimmermann (an Aussie herself, who codesigns with sister Simone). Such bad behaviorespecially in an era of strictnesscaptured her attention for Zimmermanns Spring lineup. Very mischievous, the designer said. I love the idea of an underlying naughtiness with these classic fabrications.\n",
      "The 1800s came through in elements like high collars and lace sleeves, but the sly insouciance was what captured interest: Somehow, these frilly things, like a dusty pink bib-flounce top with an ivory lattice skirt or a tiered cobalt dress with noir pearling, felt plausible for a weekend outing in modern-day Sydney. Call it Victoriana for the Bondi Beach set. And if at times it felt like a lot, in terms of texture and ornateness, one look at the crowd confirmed that with this brand, more is more, and, in fact, eminently wearablethere were plenty of Zimmermann flounces and filigrees throughout the room.\n",
      "To that, this brand retains two steadfast strengths: One, the clothes are always well made. But two, those clothes are often chameleonic between formal and easyand the theme this season synced nicely with this equation. So why not wear bell sleeves to the Bondi Icebergs? Be one of those naughty Australians.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zo Jordan,Maya Singer,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Water, water, everywhere, / nor any drop to drink. Those lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner sprang instantly to mind upon encountering Zo Jordans new ocean-theme collection. She hit her water concept hard, evoking the sea in everything from the fishermans knots on the sleeves of cashmere-blend sweaters to wave-printed neoprene to tailored pieces as glittery as ocean phosphorescence. All of which could have read as a bit on the nose, except that Jordan put together a nicely varied wardrobe herethere was a good range to her easy-to-wear silhouettes. The easy-to-wear thing is important: The designer has a knack for making un-precious clothes, whether a pair of slouchy cropped trousers or an anorak in tonal camouflage jacquard, and shes canny about using her materials to give those utilitarian shapes a sense of elevation. What she hasnt quite managed to do yet is stamp her label with a strong identitythough the women who will be snapping up Jordans terrific, well-priced knits wont likely feel the need to complain about that. She seems to be narrowing in on a signature look. This season, though, the Zo Jordanness of Zo Jordan remained slightly out of focus.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,Zuhair Murad,Amy Verner,PARIS,\" October 4, 2015\",\"From a new Paris showroom, Zuhair Murad came across as particularly buoyant. He showed off pictures of his delicate, lacy designs for the New York City Ballet dancers and revealed that he will be designing J.Los wardrobe for her gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, his starting point for Spring was sailor sensuality, which, despite the campy coupling, offered a sea of opportunity to expand on his strengths. Daywear largely consisted of nautical elements, from marinire dresses in mixed-gauge knits to wide-leg sailor pants. Sensitive to his clients lifestyles, he steered the theme away from fisherman and toward yacht-level luxestandouts included the crisp, white double-breasted captains suit and chic separates resembling naval pennants in satiny scuba material. If the plunging-V, shorter-than-short jumpsuit in striped sequins went overboard on cheek, its exactly the type of piece that could prompt a celeb stylist tug-of-war.\n",
      "But the cheek continued with lipstick lips planted in jacquard, embroidery, and more sequins. In each port, the women are leaving kisses, mused Murad, who pointed out that even the monochromatic knits featured lip motifs embedded into the mesh. A coral-floral patterning reverted back to his predictable mix of sheer and sparkle. Yet the look that outshone all the others was not the least bit glitz; instead, the satin scuba had been transformed into a solid red gown, its elongated top trussed with thick grosgrain. Lets call it five-alarm siren.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,1205,Luke Leitch,LONDON,\" September 19, 2015\",\"Fashion and Instagram are such (often saccharine) bedfellows because they are both platforms whose participants are preset for positive affirmation. Yet even the most cynical London showgoers are stirred by the sense that Paula Gerbases 1205 is potentially something rather special. To truly understand her womens clothes you need to briefly to think about menswear. For several years Gerbase was head designer at Kilgour (the Savile Row tailoring house), which is headed up by Carlo Brandelli, a compellingly intense chap whose preoccupation is the reduction of the classic masculine suit into its sublimated, sculptural essence. This is the touchstone upon which the super-serious Gerbase has sparked her own trajectory. \n",
      "Todays collection, she said, was partially informed by a holiday trek through the Atlas Mountains, but thatpah!was just spiel. Really what she was doing was whittling down shapes and concepts into a pragmatic-ish conceptual skeleton. So we saw carefully slouchy nappa shirts and paneled trousers; neutral nonsymmetric knits slung like minimalists' bandoliers and jackets woven of paper with corsetry inserts. The color palette was deliciously dull. Pliss, both in nylon and silk, served as the scrunchy subtext against which Gerbases Puritan withdrawal was expressed. And all this came underlined by cultishly unsullied all-white Nike Air Max 90s. For forensic under-the-radar neutrality, in London, 1205 is the label to turn to.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,3.1 Phillip Lim,Maya Singer,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Let other New York City fashion designers toast the 10th anniversary of their brand by getting down and dirty. Phillip Lim celebrated a decade of 3.1 with plain old dirt. Mounds of the stuff were installed all around Lims catwalk this afternoon, in an arrangement designed by architect Maya Lin. As Lim revealed after the show, the dirt was in fact compost that he and his team had been making from their own food waste and storing up for months. I was thinking, he said, about where things start. They start from a seed. They start from dirt. The compost mounds on the runway, which would be de-installed post-show and delivered to local parks, thus symbolized both beginnings and rebirth.\n",
      "It was a fitting theme for this show, which found Lim reprising various signatures but arranging them in a way that felt new. This collection boasted a directness that some of Lims recent outings have lackedhis modus operandi here was, put simply, to take sporty and/or mannish looks and infuse them with a sense of romance. That strategy was apparent in the most instantly appealing of the looks he showed today, pinstriped pieces billowing with ruffles or collaged with floral prints. But it was evidenced, as well, in the likewise ruffled scuba tops, and the bomber jackets done in organza, satin, or silk.\n",
      "This show could have been a touch more concise. Lim had several strong ideas going here, like the fluid paper-bag waist trousers and the taut sweaters and dresses in burlap nylon that seemed to degrade into floral metallic jacquard, and he elevated the collection as a whole by focusing on its sense of hand, whether in the luxe green gazar used in a matching bandeau and high-slit skirt, or the delicate floral appliqu embellishing otherwise straightforward tops. But there was some clutter, too. The cargo pants and adapted biker jackets could have stayed in the showroom, for instance. Those pieces werent bad; they just diluted the poetry of the show as a whole. Lim has made it this farthere will be plenty of time to show biker jackets in the 10 years ahead.\"\n",
      "2016,Spring,6397,Kristin Anderson,NEW YORK,\" September 14, 2015\",\"Flower power? Yep, the power to make a convert of avowed industry tomboy Stella Ishii. This season, the 6397 founder and her team began with flora in many a form, from their signature, supersoft pima graphic tees (one in fact read Flower Power, another was printed all over with different varietals) to a rose-pattern burnout tank.\n",
      "From there on out, though, it was 6397 business as usual: a strong lineup of the killer basics that have made the brand a staunch favorite of industry types. One of those staple pieces, however, went notably missing here: the mechanic suit, as seen on Bey, Heidi Klum, et al. After seasons in the range, Ishii and co. are giving the style a break, introducing instead a short-sleeved jumpsuit with patch pockets on the chest, a higher waistline, and a breezy zip front.\n",
      "Likewise, 6397 has proposed pajama dressing in various forms from the get-go; that trends newfound legs should make their silky black set, worn together or separately, a big hit. And hungry denimheads, take heart! After a couple of seasons of focusing on ready-to-wear, the label is back with remnant denim skirts, and not one, but two new jean shapes: the lightweight, low-slung Loose Capri, and the Tommy, a pitch-perfect wide-leg.\"\n"

They were riding pillion on a 25-strong lineup of muscle bikesHarleys and Triumphs. This was because, as An Vandevorst explained pre-show: Its a road trip by a woman who lives in the East and has traveled to the West. Hence the mirrored Indian beading of lean biker-touched separates and fabulous goth-influenced saris, and the silver-shot Chinese brocade on cheongsam-biker hybrids. None of these souvenir details was especially literal; a studded, textured, and collarless burgundy jacket looked Chanel-meets-Mongolia (via Antwerp) and made a fine cupola to the elaborately tented blue pliss skirt below. Vandevorst ticsfrogging, tailoring, leanness, sculpted volume for effectrecurred, most strongly on a set of white looks near the finale that achieved malleable stiffness and an otherworldly glow thanks to the aluminum shot through the fabrics. Also starring here was a pedal-to-the-metal judo suit. Crocheted face masks with sequined lips were de-sinisterized balaclavas, and the footwear, naturally, was all biker bootsalthough sometimes it featured high heels. Road signs were enlarged and broken up into the print used on one long, flowing coat worn tied around the waist by its sleevesand once the show was done, the bikers outside willfully ignored local traffic regulations and roared off en masse. One of them broke down, but that was the only glitch in this delightful little riot of a collection.$$August saw the announcement of big news for A.L.C. a long time in the works: a majority investor in the form of new kid on the block InterLuxe (Jason Wu marks their only other fashion interest to date). And still, despite this key development in the labels business, designer Andrea Lieberman has gone and turned out one of her most intensely personal collections to date. Inspired by a Berber textile she had picked up in her travels and stashed away in a box at her fathers home, she let a certain nomadic romanticism guide her hand for Spring, to an effect that was soulful and punk at the same time, as Lieberman dubbed it. A knack for winning and inventive distillations of the 70s and 90s has distinguished A.L.C. for a while now; here that came through in spades, without so much as a trace of the costumey (the most literal retro indulgences were a great studded jacket in whiskey-color suede and crocheted maxi numbers). Instead, Lieberman whipped up fantastic chevron knit gowns and strapless belted maxi dresses.  The prints here also stood out as perhaps the labels strongest to date: quietly folky-looking pink and chocolate blooms on a black background, inspired by a henna-treated ceremonial veil; the fantastic, simple white tone-on-tone cotton jacquard influenced by a headdress and seen in a matching jacket and A-line skirt; and a muted yet lush-looking take on tie-dye.  In discussing the lineup, Lieberman said she was particularly interested in creating a sense of restraint with these clothes. That was here, of course, and the spare elegance of A.L.C. continues to distinguish it from so many of its peers in the contemporary market; but what really spoke most clearly in this collection was a feeling of general, offhanded richness. It was plenty to whet your palate for the big developments in both retail and wholesale on the horizon for the brand.$$They call me the king of basics, Jean Touitou said with a laugh at the APC presentation today. Kingliness is one thing, but the basics bit has lately proved irksome to Touitou. He decided to do something about it this season, starting by making a capsule offering of little black dresses. Its an item whose APC time has come. Past due, even. There are few things more essential to a French womans wardrobe than an LBD, after all. Touitou used black silk crepe, a first for him, he admitted, but he insisted the silhouettes remain quite simple, ensuring they stayed close to the spirit of the brand. A long tube dress was cut on the bias so it glided over the body without gripping it, and the excess material on a shorter one became a cape-like sash to wear loose behind the back or wrapped around the shoulders. A third one, cut on the grain and featuring a single leather shoulder strap, was a favorite of the editors passing through the companys Rue Madame headquarters.  Amidst the boy-cut denim pieces, the overalls, the smocks, and the well-cut trench that rounded out the collection, the other news was a shoulder bag made from molded vegetable-dyed leather. It had a great saddlebag shape, but the novelty wasnt how it looked or what it felt like; it was in the fact that it will be available for sale right away, not months from now. Despite inroads by a few brands, fashion seems stubbornly resistant to the see now/buy now concept, and the missed opportunities just keep multiplying. Good on Touitou and team APC for figuring this project out.$$Natalia Alaverdian is a designer with a lot of ideas. Good ones. Her latest A.W.A.K.E. collection threaded references to her spirit animal for this season, the zebra, through a rich variety of motifs, ranging from dream-of-Africa aesthetics to ones cribbed from Vermeers Holland and 80s-era fashion from Japan, not to mention a dollop of 90s grungy-ness. Alaverdian hopped along from one association to another, racking them up on top of each other in a way redolent of those corporate brainstorm meetings where every notion, no matter how distant from the topic at hand, gets added nonjudgmentally to the dry-erase board. Alaverdian is at the point in her career as a designer where she should be able to refine her stew of ideas into an easily comprehensible proposition, rather than continuing to serve them up brainstorm-style. This collection was full of winning piecesfluid, duster-length trench coats; tops and jackets with sculptural pouf sleeves; checked pencil dresses; and skirts with muscular ruffles and bowsbut they were swamped by the surfeit of looks that featured complicated asymmetrics, or vast volumes that felt nonspecific. The motley print and pattern here, and the way Alaverdian layered them together, added to the sensory overload. Its not that Alaverdian needs to trim down her ideassome looks, like the A-line floral coat paired with a mid-calf seersucker skirt embellished with rosettes, got at all (or at any rate, most) of them with clarity and concision. When she applies real rigor to her hyper-associative design process, the charm of her aesthetic comes through.$$Process has always been paramount to Ace & Jigs Jenna Wilson and Cary Vaughanin their own work, but also, as Spring tells it, in that of others. The pair were particularly fascinated with the German conceptual artist Wolfgang Laib, who worked heavily in natural materials, memorably gathering pollens of different consistencies and hue (dandelion, hazelnut, et al) and creating geometric shapes from them. Some of Springs myriad prints nodded to those forms, but there are plenty of inherent parallels to the duos process. The looms in India that their cotton gauzes are woven on are traditional and time-honored, a far cry from fashions heavily automated present. Textiles are always the real news for Ace & Jig, and Springs most winning developments included a graphic black-and-red stripe, pitch-perfect as a column gown, as well as nods to kente fabrics. Warmth has long been a distinguishing characteristic of Wilson and Vaughans clothingthat came through here in spades. Best of all was a stunning kimono with a hand-woven collar, created in collaboration with Los Angeles textile studio All Roads.$$A bohemian circle of muses have been in heavy rotation for the last couple of seasonsJoni Mitchell, Janis Joplin, and the likebut now it seems that things in fashion might be moving to a new musical beat. Acne Studios creative director Jonny Johansson is certainly keen on pressing the fast-forward button, and his latest collection vibrated with an energy that fell somewhere between 80s electro and 90s rave culture. Electric guitars made of chrome and plexiglass, which embellished the length of cropped trousers and boxy suiting, were the most obvious leitmotifs here. More convincing, though, were the eye-catching optical polka-dot prints that resembled the dilated pupils of euphoric ravers, on floor-length velvet and silk dresses that were fastened in the back with guitar-like strapsa cool take on the slip dressing trend. If one were to peg the collection to a stylish musical icon in particular, it would likely be Grace Jones. The radical 67-year-old Jamaican singer just published her memoirs, and has been inspiring a new generation of fans with her risk-taking sorry-not-sorry sense of style. Jones recently caused a stir at the Afropunk Festival in New York wearing one of her many elaborate costumes (it involved little more than a corset G-string body suit, and a Hula-Hoop that she kept spinning around her lithe torso). The blazers-cum-minidresses that Johansson paired with short-as-you-dare hot pants and statement asymmetric shades were a look that Jones could pull off to this day, though its doubtful who else could, besides superstar bad gals like Rihanna perhaps, who has been making headlines with her pantless ensembles all summer long. In some ways it felt as if part of the grounding street smart vibrations that first propelled Acne into the spotlight were lacking today; the cut and fit of their original oversized biker jackets and shearling coat is still hard to beat, after all. Still, warm-weather dressing isn't something that Nordic fashion folk have much time to experiment with. The discharge-print boy racer tees and charming checkerboard slip-on Moroccan slippers, on the other hand, are likely to be a hit with the first bloom of spring.$$Walking into Adam Lippess Washington Square apartment presentation is a rare Fashion Week treat. From the breakfast spread to his trio of standard poodles to this seasons piano player, you feel instantly at home. At the very least, you want to move in.  Against this exceedingly pleasing backdrop, Lippes presented a fine new collection, one that solidified his reputation for effortless chic, but also found him developing new categories. Lippes said an audacious floral-print suit from his Fall collection had something to do with his Spring experiments. He figured its bold color and pattern would render it an outlier. On the contrary, its been a total sellout, and its success gave him the license he needed to try a glam white jumpsuit with an outer layer in hand-macramd silk cord. Its a feat of engineering and easily the sexiest thing hes done yet. A strapless black silk faille gown was more demure, but an equally convincing foray into high evening. Still, its his polished sportswear thats been helping him double his business each season, so the big emphasis here was on daywear. Pieces like a 16-ply cashmere sweatshirt accompanied by gold micro pliss pants as comfy as pjs, a washed denim apron dress thrown over an oversize poplin tee, and slouchy linen track pants teamed with a striped shirt, its elongated tails hanging loose in back. Lippess m.o. is refined, but not so much so that it compromises his clothes casual factor. Extra credit for the generously proportioned slip dresses in an Agnes Martininspired abstract print.$$Ever the adventurer, Adam Selman will gleefully chart a course where others dare not go. Fall found him obsessed with Cookie Mueller, an oft-overlooked bad girl in John Waterss morally bankrupt coterie. This season Selman blew all the way to one of the smaller Hawaiian islands, where he discovered Taylor Camp, a 60s and 70s nudist colony on the oceanfront property of a witting Howard Taylor, shortly after his impossibly glamorous sister, Elizabeth, played her baddest role yet in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Selman is keenly aware that he has a fondness for foul-mouthed spitfires: Ill always have my bad girls, he chuckled backstage, beaming through his signature stache. Clothing isnt optional on a runway, so Selman snapped out of his beach-induced high, brushed off the sand, and set about crafting latter-day hippiewear with a focus on what he called nonchalant exposure. Joyful flower prints and appliqus on jaunty summer dresses bounded out to a cheery sing-along soundtrack. They were mixed with breezy denim separates, as well as white bandeaux and drawstring slacks, some of which were reversed to reveal seams and pockets. An erstwhile symbol of modesty, gauzy crinolines were stripped of their cumbersome shells and placed front and center, starting with the first exit. Converse All Stars were also reworked, DIY-style, to become platform espadrilles. However, a baby tee with an illustrated image of a woman smoking a blunt was obscured by a denim jacket by the time it hit the catwalk. This wasnt just a nod to pot-smoking, free-loving, skin-baring hippies, but also an ode to an authentic craftsy look, in particular the work of Todd Oldham, the designer perhaps best loved for so artfully cobbling things together on MTVs House of Style with Cindy Crawford. Unbeknownst to most, there he was in the audience today, happily yakking it up with more of Selmans bad girls, Amy Sedaris and Lea DeLaria (Orange Is the New Black). Its a tribute to me? asked Oldham after the show, in believable disbelief. He described how he and Selman had met while hanging wallpaper with Sedaris. Im in awe of Adam, he said. Hes the real deal.$$Hanako Maeda has been busy rediscovering her Japanese roots. On a recent trip to Kyoto, she grew particularly enamored of her native countrys architecture. For Spring, she focused on marrying the aesthetic heritage of Japan with the lean sophistication of New York, her adopted hometown, just as East met West during the Edo period. Maedas clothes have never lacked in urbane appeal, so it was a particular treat to see how she incorporated traditional elements and pitted structure against fluidity. The past several seasons have witnessed the designer loosening up her once ladylike vernacular, and there was a downright languidness to these pieces. The kimono was of particular interest to Maeda, who borrowed traditional prints from those garments and elements of the obi that cropped up on a flowing wrap dress, or across the front of a long vest. Elsewhere, the knotted neckline on a gauzy maxi nodded to the process behind traditional shibori dyeing techniques, and the red, harness-like sash on a starry black-and-white gown (perhaps the strongest look in todays lineup) echoed the tasuki traditionally worn by Japanese drum players, among others. But you could hardly hope for a more fitting marriage of the modern-day and the traditional than Maedas raw indigo denim mini with a flowing underlay of shibori-printed chiffon. Despite the newfound ease to her clothes, Maeda remains as adroit as ever when it comes to evening: Her strapless, obi-inspired jacquard dress (look 29) was just the antidote to overwrought red carpet fare. Between day and night, these pieces added up to the labels strongest outing in recent memory. If Maeda has had a tendency in the past to change her course a bit from season to season, you hoped shed stay this one.$$According to the folks at Adidas HQ, this seasons Adidas by Stella McCartney collection was inspired by athletes. Well . . . duh? Isnt this an activewear line? What McCartneys reflection on athletes and athleticism meant in practice was that this was a collection more focused on functionality than aestheticsthe updates mainly had to do with details of cut and fabrication that optimized the performance of the apparel. That was witnessed in the feathery weight of the running gear and elements such as compression bands, reflective strips, mesh inserts, and internal cooling dots placed at points on the body where the body generates the most heat. McCartneys zebra-print maillots were cut with an eye toward hydrodynamismthey also looked a good deal hipper than the standard-issue racing suitand her seamless knit onesie managed to hark back to Western yoga practices boho roots and deploy new textile technology in aid of peak flexibility. Women who are devotees of a particular sport will appreciate McCartneys care in seeing to their utilitarian needs; those who mainly aim to compete in the sport of fashion, meanwhile, will glom on to pieces such as the designers floral-print anorak and ergonomic black-and-white sandal, an excellent alternative come spring to the omnipresent Birk. Performance was the focus here, in other words, but there was more than one way this collection performed.$$This collection was an ode to Tiresias, a bird-communicating Greek soothsayer who blabbed divine secrets and was punished by being blinded then turned into a womanas whom she was both praised as a priestess and pilloried as a prostitute (depending on who you read)before eventually gender-reverting. Which is actually kind of now. The clothes themselves seemed more literal articulations of the 18th century (perhaps edging the cusp of the 19th) in terms of form: There were full-bodied frock coats with jauntily pointed tales, corsetry, an inclination toward ruffle-free yet jabot-like fullness at the neck, and a sense of tailoring pared back and made primitive. As an Aganovich virgin, to these eyes there also seemed a soft backdrop of Ackermann, Watanabe, and Westwood here: neither as debt nor derivation, just context.  The collection was an ongoing argument between the tie (masculine trope) and the color pink (feminine trope). Both tropes were warped, abused, remixed, and blended. Batik-dyed linen was the outer layer against folded-back flashes of silk organza animal print, an inversion of hierarchy that saw the rougher fabric promoted to front of house with the snazzier pushed to the fringes. There were moments when the fumes pumping forth from the Viper smoke machine became a little too thick to see all the orchid undulations on offer or to appreciate the twists in the muted monochrome brocades. Yet there was clarity enough to appreciate this tightly packed meditation on wearable tumult.$$This was a poignant presentationyet not necessarily in the way that Agnonas producers intended. In the atrium a tree had been installed whose foliage was a mixture of desiccated leaves and dead butterflies. From its lifeless branches hung 16 looks that were two-thirds miniaturized in cashmere voile11 from the archive and five from the new collection. What they demonstrated was how rich the history of this mill, specializing in rare yarns and founded by Francesco Ilorini Mo in 1953, truly is. Balmain, Dior, Chanel, Cardin, Saint Laurent (when it was all about Yves)back in the day, Agnona cast all of these canonical designers sketches in wool. Agnona made brilliance real.  Today? Well, its not awful. Agnona is never going to be a summer house, obviously. Still, there was a gorgeous suede wrap dress that, while completely divorced from the essence of this brand, was a thing of beauty and rightfully spotlighted center stage. Some impressive hand-painted pliss pants were worth an ogle. The brown leopard blouse was less moving, the foliage-print caftans were definitely wearable, but the safari jackets just served as piquant reminders of Saint Laurent. Agnona is owned by Ermenegildo Zegnaa titanic fashion house whose main business is the sartorial outfitting of men. The arrival of Stefano Pilati was heralded as a new dawn for the Agnona-Zegna womenswear dream team. That plan changed when Pilatis focus shifted to the wonderful Zegna Couture. In the meantime, Agnona has been left out in the colda book without an author. It deserves one.$$Akriss Albert Kriemler has long looked to architecture as a reference, but he made the relationship explicit for Spring, teaming up with the Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto to create fabrics. Fujimoto designed Londons Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in 2013. Kriemler was so moved by the matrix of white steel poles that he approached Fujimoto about working together. Backstage it was hard to tell who was more excited about the collaborationKriemler or Fujimoto. The architect sat in the front row; it was his first fashion show. Architecture is architecture and clothes are clothes. Bringing them together isnt always the smoothest project. Indeed, there were a few proposals here that read as too literal: A dress made from thin strips of cork to look like wood siding with a black mesh window at the hip, for example, was a little on the nose. The Forest of Music is a music hall project in Budapest with a molded round roof that has openings for trees to grow. The shirts and skirts it inspired were perhaps a tad eccentric for the Akris customer. Where the clients are concerned, the best pieces on the runway were the ones made from square slices of Perspex sealed between two layers of organza. The streamlined dresses glinted subtly; they wont require any backstory on the sales floor. On the other hand, if the Akris woman learns about Naoshima, the Japanese island filled end-to-end with art museums and site-specific installations, including Fujimotos faceted pavilion, then this Akris collection was a job well done.$$The backdrop of Alberta Ferrettis show was an aerial video of the desert: sand sliding over mile upon mile of dunes, nothing but sun, wind, and skyand just about as far away from Milans rain-soaked streets as you could get today. The wide-open vistas offered clues to Ferrettis frame of mind. The desert is free, theres movement, there are possibilities, she said backstage. I closed my eyes and we had many, many ideas.  Nature is a theme that Fausto Puglisi would take up a few hours later, but where his version was rough around the edges, Ferrettis this season was bohemian. There was a bit of the festival girlCoachella by way of Burning Manto her pieced lace slip dresses and patchwork suede shifts in warm shades of brown and black. Ferretti has made a specialty of whisper-thin dresses over the years. Usually they have more of a red carpet orientation, but true to her word, here they came in breezy chiffons with fraying at the edges and as a decorative motif. Along with the lacy white cotton numbers, slightly Victorian in spirit, these were among the best pieces in the show, effortless and earthy, perched on corded gladiator sandals where some of the more elaborately worked and printed dresses, often with rough-hewn gold jewelry, came off heavy and overdone.  A detour through some safari-influenced daywear captured that easy vibe, but they seemed rather beside the point. At Alberta Ferretti, the dress is always the thing.$$For Spring, Alessandra Rich unveiled an unabashedly feminine collection dubbed Dolores, after an invented South American heroine, one whose wardrobe for her romantic escapades is punctuated by expanses of lace; frilled, fluted hems; and large, poufy sleeves worn off the shoulder. The story is of a girl who runs away to get married, said Rich at an appointment off the Rue Saint-Honor, characteristically charming and wearing one of the gold heartaccented belts that accessorized the runway looks. Its probably a bad idea, but she does it anyway. And she does it in style: An excellent waist-whittling trenchcoat in silk moir was offered in three colorways (black, white, and fuchsia) and proved just the ticket for a dramatic escape from disapproving parents and friends. The wedding festivities would be celebrated in bow-topped tiers of fluffy white lace. She is definitely a girl in love, purred Rich, and it shows; party dresses came in pleated, cutout, off-the-shoulder lam or as a series of paillette-bedecked wiggle gowns with trumpet hems, while a number of silk rompers were deployed for their lingerie codas (one plunging cream tie-accented dress was very Bianca Jagger). But among all of the exuberance, it was the selection of seriously good denim (the use of the textile being a first for Rich) jackets, body-conscious dresses, and sleek jumpsuits that just might prove to outlast the honeymoon period. After all, as every girl knows, flash can be fun, but strong and steady often ends up winning the day.$$And then there was light. . . . Alexander Lewis isnt afraid of a religious reference, but he wasnt riffing on Genesis in his new, light-themed collection. Rather, on this occasion he took Richard Dawkinss tack, and regarded the science of light with a near-spiritual sense of awe. This season Lewis collaborated with the artist Flavie Audi, who makes sculptures of metal and glass, and he was fascinated by the way light plays on and within her work. That inspired a study of the properties of lightits wavelike form, the way it refracts through prisms, how its reflection glimmers and splits across the surface of things. It was a good season, in other words, for Lewis to have sponsorship from crystal honchos Swarovski. Lewis got at his theme via a variety of means. He made rubbings of Audis sculptures and developed cloud-like prints and patterned jacquards, and he peered into the insides of her work and watched the alchemy of her materials, then created galactic-looking prints that magnified those reactions. There were also crystal-dappled sheer silks, frequently found layered with other, more plainspoken materials such as shirting pinstripe, that recalled the reaction prints starry night sky effect. Elsewhere, Lewis conjured light waves via crystal strands dangling off a dress, or caviar crystal pressed into the fabric of a pale blue skirt. Blue was the key color here; this collection also emphasized dresses and skirts more than most Lewis outings. The collection was at its best, oddly, when Lewis interpreted his theme either extremely literally or extremely looselyhis pinstripe pieces were a highlight, for instance, but so was the sweater with a refracting prism intarsia-ed across the front, and a cropped top with mirror cube embroidery. The one quibble here, really, was with Lewiss insistence that all his garments express his concept, either more or less directly. In general, his sense of focus redounds to his benefit, but it would be nice to see this designer loosen up a little, and permit himself to, say, cut a sharp pair of trousers, or conjure a fluid, flattering dress, just because they complement the rest of his collection. Lewis gets his points across just finehe should have the confidence, going forward, not to underline them.$$The girls had pink-cheeked complexions and tousled hair flowing down their backsa bunch of young English roses who might have been caught by Julia Margaret Camerons camera lens in Victorian times. What they were dressed in were the prettiest and most personal designs that have come from Sarah Burton since she took over as creative director of Alexander McQueen. Gone were the face-obscuring headdresses and ironclad corsets; gone the hobbling platform shoes. I wanted it to be believable, touchable, soft, said Burton backstage. To an extent, the beautiful dresseswith their ruffles cascading across the body and falling off shoulders, the palette of pale pink, the flower-strewn patterns, the pristine cotton, the tattered lace, and the frock-coated tailoringspeak for themselves. Everything about them in these times when every camera phone has a zoom lens can be examined in all their extraordinary detail, down to the finest knitted stitches, the flower-painted wooden clogs, and the couture-level embroidery. On the other hand, for all that the ethereal lightness, whip-smart tailoring, and elaborate designs communicated a new, relaxed, of-the-season relevance, they also carried the story of a London history that Burton wanted to make known.  She explained that shed been inspired by the 17th-century silk weavers of Spitalfields, members of the Huguenot Protestant faith who fled religious persecution in France and settled in Londons East End. I loved the stories of how they arrived with very little, bringing seeds and bulbs in their pockets to grow. They were gardeners. And they wove their French flowers into the patterns on their silks.  Burtons choice of reference point was personalshe is a country girl with a real love of naturebut the resonances run deeper than her attraction to pretty flowers. Alexander McQueen traced part of his family bloodline back to some of the estimated 50,000 Huguenot refugees who were welcomed into Britain by the edict of King Charles II and became producers of high fashion silks for court finery and the great homes of England. McQueen was proud of that link to the first immigrants to bring luxury fashion to London, and he would surely approve of his former protge using this platform to point to the parallels with todays migrant crisis.  There was one silk dress, covered with sprigs of flowers, that came somewhere in the middle of the collection and was a near replica of a 17th-century court dress Burton examined. How funny to imagine that this delightful, demure dress might have its own outing at the British court in the 21st century. Kate Middleton would look wonderful in it.$$Alexander Wang has always loved a bash, and for his 10th anniversary collection tonight he threw himself a big one. Up front, a merch table sold his DoSomething.org tees and sweats, which benefit the organizations youth and social change efforts. It was straight out of a rock show, a feeling that was accentuated inside the venue by the crush of celebrities who sat in the front row. Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Josh Ostrovsky (a.k.a. The Fat Jew), The Weeknd, Bella Hadid, Mary J. Blige . . . the list goes on. Post-show, a curtain at the back of the runway opened to reveal a phalanx of pole dancers, who entertained the throngs until it was time for the partys big numbers. Tinashe, Lil Wayne, and Ludacris all performed. But the nights main act was the video that played after the models took their finale spin. An extended highlights reel, it was a long, loud, chronological look back at Wangs first decade, from his early bows, short-haired and baby-faced at 21, all the way through last Novembers H&M collab and his Fall 15 advertising campaign.  Its a critical moment for Wang. In July, he and Balenciaga opted not to renew their contract beyond its first three-year term. Such a short tenure at such a prestigious house could tarnish a designers reputation, but Wang has emerged essentially unscathed and, as he seemed to be saying with tonights hoopla, bigger than ever.  When the split was announced, Wang suggested that he wanted to turn his focus to his eponymous brand. That meant expectations were elevated for this new collection. If some of the surrounding festivities (ahem, those pole dancers) were somewhat off-message, he nailed the collection, which was free of pretense. No concept, he said backstage, summing up the straight-off-the-streets ethos of the clothes. Were always asking ourselves whats modern. Well, whats modern is whats right in front of us. Thats an idea thats gained traction in the industry over the last couple of years, but it was Wangs own approach at the beginning. It worked for him then, and, save for a couple of costumey fringed leather pieces, it worked for him tonight with his deconstructed denim, army surplus separates, pajama silks, slip dresses, and one shrunken satin bomber jacket. Wang intuitively gets what the downtown cool girl wants to wear. Theres no disputing the New Yorkiness of his clothes, but no anniversary collection is complete without a throwback moment. Anybody still wondering what the AW510 insignia that turned up on an oversize hoodie and some of the mens pieces stands for? Wang, remember, hails from Northern California: 510 is the born-in-the-Bay-Area area code of his cellphone.$$Few and far between are the menswear designers willing and able to transition into the womens market. In fact its a genuinely rare scenario that often builds in reverse, so when ex-Cloak designer Alexandre Plokhov tried his hand at a ladies line for Fall 2015, trusting devotees welcomed his evolution with open arms. Now that moody, almost all-black debut is hitting stores, the Eve to Plokhovs Adam has hit her stride for Springforegoing the darkly draped tendency of his first outing in favor of a crisp sensuality, where D-ring cinched belts, snap-buttoned patch pockets, and zipped lapels helped shape his utilitarian vision. Having tweaked a cropped tailoring silhouette and developed a wrapped, linear form to his apron dresses and boxy tunics, Plokhov accented this collection with a slew of subtly worked-on fabricsturning to washed leather, patchwork jersey, polka dots, and a shredded stripe jacquard that felt rich in hand against his flat cotton poplins. The latter material was frayed and box-pleated across shirtsleeves and buttoned A-line skirts, both of which appeared in a sunny shade of citrus yellow in his Paris showroom. Though edited out of these images, that optimistic shade joined the black, navy, and sand color lineup to further shake up the masculine tendencies of Plokhovs oeuvre, rendering his outsider label all the more relevant in a season rife with gender ambiguity.$$If you laid out the looks from Alexandre Vauthiers Fall haute couture collection alongside those he proposed for Spring ready-to-wear, youd very quickly have a stack of matching pairsright down to the shoes, produced by Sebastian. Of course, nothing would be identical; for ready-to-wear, Maison Lesage hand-embroidery became mechanical and the leather fringes now appeared in jersey. But the gist was there. Even Daria Strokus, who closed Vauthiers couture show, returned as his ready-to-wear leading lady (looking particularly femme fatale in the Oscar Niemeyerdesigned French Communist Party Headquarters). The temptation to declare dj vu lessens once you take the holistic view that a designer needs a top-notch testing ground to breed the best ideas (and for what its worth, Raf does the same over at Dior). Plus, Vauthier upholds his fixation with fitthe body-grazing blazers and body-con laced bias dresses revealed curves, not compromises. He took pride in showing how he turned an obscenely expensive lace-encrusted dress into a generally expensive lace-encrusted dress without a noticeable difference. And the opium red leather biker dress was basically a dead ringer. In fact, the biggest difference with Vauthiers ready-to-wear offering was the injection of filler pieces: sexy bodysuits, tailored vests, and an LBD that can be worn loose and poncho-style or sleekly belted. Within the past two weeks, Aubrey Plaza, Suki Waterhouse, and Vauthiers loyal patroness Carine have all furthered his red carpet visibility. But while this may be prime advertising, the introduction of a dressed-down linen grouping suggested its not his sole focus. Each of the piecesbe it a jumpsuit or a shirtdressreceived some sort of Vauthier golden touch. Maybe theyll prove the launchpad for his Spring couture.$$In 2011 a food-supply scandal made the news in China when watermelon farmers who had sprayed their crops with a chemical product that promised rapid growth were dismayed to discover it served only to make their melons explode into worthless pulp. Earlier this month a minority stake in Alexis Mabille was sold to a 3,400-outlet Chinese fast-fashion outfit called Peacebird, which plans to roll out a network of Mabille stores in China. Mabille chose the watermelon as his motif for this, his first post-Peacebird ready-to-wear collection. There was a sequined watermelon on the front of a ruche-armed sweatshirt teamed with some jaunty shorts and a sheer half-skirt, watermelon print split-to-the-hip pants, watermelon bracelets, watermelon necklacesyou get the drift. More ambiently watermelon-touched were the dubious contra-color layered lace slip dressesin watermelon-esque tonesand satin separates. This collection was at its best when sans watermelon yet explosive of silhouette: The oversize biker jackets and skirts were easy and fun. There was also a sweet 80s-flavor jumpsuit with volumized arms and a tonal fold at the neck. Plus, Mabille slices a pretty fine jacket: The single vented (watermelon) red example with an interestingly projecting revere was proof of that. There was an emphasis on open-at-the-back shirtingperfectly fineand an insistence on miniature backpack fanny packskind of Philipp Plein. This was very much a locals show, packed to its marble rafters with Parisians breathily just-about tolerating (as only Parisians can) the abundance of their fellows. The new Peacebird aspect to Mabilles story lent it an edge, which the clothes unfortunately rather lacked. It also made you really hanker after a nice ripe slice of lovely, juicy watermelon: organic, ideally.$$I feel like baby number three sort of inspired the desert vibes, said Alice + Olivia designer Stacey Bendet, who is scheduled to give birth next Tuesday and still had the wherewithal to slip into a minidress and thigh-high platform boots for her presentation today. This pregnancy got me really thinking about the inner goddess of the woman, which led me somehow to the desert, she said. Of course, the aforementioned bump made traveling a good deal trickier. Bendet thus relied on the desert of her imagination, conjuring up images of Earth Mothers and boho babes frolicking among the dunes in hand-embroidered skirts, flouncy off-the-shoulder tops and gowns, and sun-baked neutrals. It helped, too, that she had a man on the ground. [Contemporary artist] Francesco Clemente is a good friend of mine and he kept texting me photos of desert butterflies and flowers, so that also helped to inspire the collection, said Bendet. Overall, this was a softer, more romantic outing for Alice + Olivia. Bendet worked with chiffons and ruffles in pale shades of nude, blush, and icy blue to create what she dubbed her goddess gowns. She also wanted to create dresses that could be worn during the day with flats, but would still be sufficiently special for evening. Bendet accomplished her goal in the patchwork lace dresses in black and faded ivory that swished delicately at the ankle. Meanwhile, a high-neck gown, hand-embroidered with flowers, was exactly the kind of thing one dreams of wearing to a Mexican wedding one day. While Alice + Olivia is still strongest in the eveningwear category, Bendet had plenty on offer for day, too. The designer introduced a line of couture denim into the collection this seasonflared jeans that had been hand-embroidered with flowers or laser-cut in a leaf pattern. I really wanted to focus on the return of the pant as a statement item, said Bendet, who also churned out embellished wide-leg gown pants. Every season the designer includes a capsule black-and-white collectionmixed in with the boho embroidery and soft hues, those pieces felt a little out of place this go-round. However, Bendet knows her customers well, and each season a portion of them unfailingly want black and white: Sometimes creative vision has to bow to good old-fashioned business sense.$$There are responsibilities laid before fashion designers like 32-year-old Joseph Altuzarra, the chief of which is the pressure to capture the times in the form of clothes. This season, one of the instincts which is being thrust to the fore is escapism, or at least a resistance to the troubling forces at work in the world. Altuzarras answer to that was a Spring collection he described in his studio as Very serene, about the beauty of materials which are close to nature, like linen, cotton and burlap; things which are not fussy, and meant to look wrinkled. The search for authentic emotion led him to research the Spanish side of his identitythe heritage of his fathers upbringing in the rugged Basque region of northern Spain, home to self-reliant mountain-dwelling and sea-faring people. On the other hand, Altuzarras own reality is very much attuned to a certain modern urban womans demands, or at least his interpretation of them: Its all very well yearning for the wild and free, but what does that look like when walking on the streets of New York? Altuzarras creative compromise could be read in the details: high-heeled espadrilles (partly made by a Spanish craftsman), braided jute shoulder straps on skimpy linen camisole dresses, and rope frogging on navy nautical blazers and jumpsuits. He had worked hard on injecting a sense of the handmade into his textiles, with lots of pleating derivedat some distancefrom folkloric costume; hand-painted prints in greens, blues, and sunrise orange; and some beautiful micro beaded embroideries on broderie anglaise at the end. It made for a collection which was at its most appealing in the hand and on a rail, where the minutiae and the weightlessness of the fabricsand their rare luxurious qualitiescould be felt. One could also see Altuzarras pragmatic understanding of clothes that can perform in the midst of urban heat (as well as the close-up chic of such things as the tan leather saddle-stitched clip-on earrings). On the runway, though, the presentation somehow lacked the sense of joie de vivre women look for in summer, even in baking cities, and on their way to work. Maybe that had to do with Altuzarras choice of uniformly ultra-slim models, whose unsmiling neutrality failed to bring his stated aim of carefree believably to life. Whether its summer, winter, or anything in between, Altuzarra's work, with its man-attracting slit skirts and dresses, would look a whole lot sexier on a knowing womans curves. Customers would see that in a changing room, doubtless, but it would be a healthy, humanizing step forward if Altuzarra could bring himself to show it on the runway too.$$Designers often use music as an inspiration. This season, Andre Walkers collection riffed on a single song: Althea & Donnas 1977 reggae classic, Uptown Top Ranking. At an appointment this afternoon, Walker said hed always wanted to do a thesis on that tracka really, truly terrific one, if youve never heard itand explained that hed dug into its lyrics to further his brainstorming. Dem check sey we hipWalkers check came in linen, and looked plenty hip in garments such as his short-sleeved tailored jacket, with its folded-under blurred hem. See me in a halter back . . . give you a heart attackWalkers funnel-neck halter-tops were sui generis, in particular coming in a cotton print of head sculptures by his friend and frequent collaborator Sylvie Auvray. He did his own versions of the songs khaki suit, too, albeit in dove gray. Walkers (admittedly casual) research extended beyond the lyrics of Uptown Top Ranking. He also asked his parents what had been going on in Kingston, Jamaica, around the time the track was recorded. They told him that denizens of the uptown area of the city had marked off their territory as a posh one, and taken to natty dressing to suit the attitude. One of the charms of Walkers collection was that it got at that nattinessnote his pencil skirts, cape-shouldered jacket tops, and precise tailored dresses, with their cutout sideswhile simultaneously summoning the chillaxed vibe of the song that had inspired him. Mesh-like pointelle knits and a generous helping of fishnet provided the collection with some breeziness, both literally and figuratively, while skirts cut to suggest the look of shorts or slouchy trousers introduced another kind of casual mien. Much of Walkers focus here was on fuzzing the hard edges of his silhouettes, as witnessed in that blurred hem jacket, for instance, but also in standout garments like his layered gray eyelet and white fishnet pencil skirt, and a cropped jacket with soft vertical pleats in the front. Perhaps that instinct to soften was another tribute to Althea & Donnaafter all, the most famous lyrics in their one big hit go, Love is all I bring. And this collection certainly felt open-hearted.$$As the lights dimmed to signal the start of Andrew Gns show, an omniscient, accented voice gravely announced that the designer had just undergone unexpected surgery for a heart condition. Despite a promising recovery, he could not be present. Andrew has worked on this collection until the last moment, with all his passion and determination, the voice continued. He hopes you will like it. Leaving barely a minute to process Gns life-threatening episode, the pulsing music began and the show went on, beginning with dynamic daywear inspired by getaways to the north of France and ending with sumptuously embellished gowns based on a Chinese imperial porcelain bowl Gn inherited from his parents.  Delineating the collection into two seemingly disparate parts confirmed that Gn is creatively ambidextrous, and clearly enjoys the freedom to propose sharp and soft in a single offering. The latter resituated the butterflies and peonies from his family heirloom against vibrant backgrounds, like a Pop Art homage to chinoiserie. While the butterflies were as detailed as any of the specimens on display at Deyrolle, the embroideries and multicolored stones turned pretty dresses into collector pieces. Waxing rhapsodic about surface treatments feels strange given the circumstances. Fashion may course through Gns veinshed sooner be inspired by the idea of a vacation than take onebut health comes before all else. So Andrew, we wish you a smooth and speedy recovery. And rest assured, we liked it.$$Give Angelos Bratis the plainest piece of fabric and in no time itll be transformed into a draped wonder. He is an intuitive dressmaker: Hes adamant about not being called a designer. No sketches or mood boards for himjust thoughtful consideration of body shape. Working on this collection was a sort of therapy for me, said Bratis during a walk-through held in a light-filled, hypermodern space where models where standing in front of a maze of mirrors that reflected the surrounding forest of skyscrapers, part of a newly built Milanese architectural landscape.  Bratis retreated to his native Greek village in the mountains near Athens to put together a lineup of beautiful dresses with the help of his mother. She is a great seamstressshe taught me everything! he said, pointing out liquid bias-cut polka-dot numbers cut from a single piece of silk, with decorative smock motifs hand-sewn with contrasting thread. I was thinking about the myth of Ariadne; my Greek heritage comes up in the most unexpected ways through memories, images, dreams. I love geometry, arithmetic, the mathematics of dance, the logic game of music and rhythm. But there is nothing conceptual about Bratiss creative process: Hes a sensualist, and his dresses reveal love and respect for the female body. Their shapes had a free flow; they were cut in fluid, languid fabrics and built with sophisticated draping effects, their asymmetric hems skimming the body and giving way to a soft, undulating movement. Not surprisingly, Aegean blue was the color of choice, an homage to Bratiss homeland that was also expressed in the melancholic melodies played by the harpist Vanja Contu, clad in one of Bratiss elegant kaftans.$$On heels so soaring that the average height of these looks was within a whisper of six and a half feet, this Ann Demeulemeester collection trod pointedly around themes of personal expression, recreational repression, and commercial concession. The topstitched paneled black tailoring of which the facades veered from biker to tuxedo, the painstakingly ruched black leather pants, and the backless black tank topsslash-waistcoats with a melee of obi-belt knotting at the navel were all no-brainer ticks on a buyers list. The Demeulemeester codes factor in waft and sheerness, so more ticksalthough perhaps applied a touch less firmlyat the lightly fitted, transparent racer-back silk dresses, sometimes metallically agleam, and long jackets in softly acid, blurrily animal greens and yellows. Artistic director Sebastien Meunier said the collection was titled Rising and that his starting point was the angular unreality of Alberto Giacometti, then added: It is about the extreme elegance of women; how tall, how bright, how mysterious they can be. I pushed them in a super-elegant, kinky, sadomasochist form. This explained the choker-topped harnesses that were sometimes effectivewho knew a white harness under black suiting complemented by white sunglasses could be an uncreepily powerful accessory arsenal? Yet S&M motifs speak of subjugationalbeit consensualas well as power and so seem only queasily reconcilable with the runway. The oily chartreuse feathering on sleeves and coral-like clusters of quills were here thanks to Meuniers collaboration on this collection with artist Kate MccGwire. The quilled pieces were simultaneously beautiful and sad, organic reductions into abstraction for the sake of it. This lineup lacked the uplift that Meuniers last menswear outing seemed to augur. Yet for those who enjoy pain, this was not a pleasure to watchbecause it was fine.$$The penultimate day of the New York show sprint and who among us isnt in need of a visit to some far-flung, beachy locale? Thats just what Anna Sui served up tonight, albeit only a stones throw from the fracas of an assembled many awaiting another iconoclast (the lady Madge) over at Madison Square Garden. Prompted by a recent getaway of her own to Tahiti and Honolulu, Sui riffed on pops long-standing affair with island life, from the 30s starlet Dorothy Lamour, to Elviss trinity of Hawaiian movies, to David Baileys shot of a bronzed, sun-soaked Marie Helvin. Even Jane Campions high-minded New Zealand period piece The Piano made the cut in the form of a little subtly placed Victoriana. Suis tendency toward an almost magpie-like archivists eye remains one of her more defining and compelling characteristics. In addition to the above references, she looked at sailors valentines (the intricate seashell artworks), and even lifted a phrase from the 1941 Gary Cooper vehicle Ball of Fire: killer diller, the choice slang of Barbara Stanwycks lippy nightclub performer, Sugarpuss OShea, came embroidered across the back of a top. Indeed, todays Honolulu honeys embodied all the best parts of kitsch: its color, its humor, its play. Bowling shirts and souvenir jackets came to new life in Suis hands; the latter enjoyed a major revival last season, but even if they were downright du monde, youd be hard-pressed to argue with Suis take, lushly beaded with lurid-looking sunsets and pinup mermaids. Elsewhere was a dreamy marabou-trimmed peignoir that seemed to have dropped straight out of a Bunny Yeager snap and onto the palm treedotted catwalk. It all made for a deliciously heightened version of the tourist tat of another era. And what of the prints? Sui enlisted the fabled Zandra Rhodes to create a custom pattern, a delightful seashell number (Gigi Hadid very memorably donned a scarlet sarong in it). One Lurex-drenched, undersea chiffonwith angel fishes and allwas a real winner. Sui also sent out an octopus intarsia, and board shorts crafted from a heady-looking butterfly lace.  Even as fashion continues to ride high on a wave of heavy minimalism (though a sea change is surely in the works), Sui is a designer who serves as a vivid testimony to the power of well-deployed profusion. Todays was the kind of blissful, high-energy romp to assist even the most fatigued among ussocks and sandals optional.$$Upon arrival at the Anrealage show at the Palais de Tokyo this afternoon, guests were greeted by waiters carrying trays of glasses. In one, there was water, in the other, sake. Both clear liquids, entirely alike in all properties except the important ones. Really, you see,its all in how you look at things. Until, of course, it isnt. Wireless headsets and elaborate instructions had been left on the seats: The Springcollection, one quickly gathered via the pamphlet and theEnglish robotic voice provided by the accompanying recording (think Benedict Cumberbatch meets Siri), was inspired by reflection, specifically how it warps reality. The clothes would only be fully visible through an iPhones camera app after being photographed with a flasha very modern take on a mirror, its true, but considering the plethora of devices held aloft during Fashion Week, not exactly a stretch. When the clothes appeared and were drowned in a flurry of handheld flashes, what first appeared to be a plain light gray or black-and-white striped dress became a neon houndstooth check; a glen plaid transformed into a tartan, a fancy tweed, a patchwork; pinstripes were lace; white became a kaleidoscope pattern; Mt. Fuji, a quilt. A speckled-looking frilledblack frock suddenly boasted the galaxy at warp speed, courtesy of what the show notes described as an official collaboration with the filmStar Wars (which, if true, should provide at least one of the upcomingfilms young stars with a seriously viable red carpet ensemble for an upcoming Comic-Con). Often the garments themselves were reversed, inverted, rejiggered: two pieces sewn together at the hemisphere to make a slightly off-kilter asymmetrical form, which came out a lot more appealingly than it sounds, especially in the case of the cropped bomber jackets; rounded sleeve sheaths; and short, A-line shifts. One has come to expect this level of technological trickery from designerKunihiko Morinaga, who has played with the ideas of exposure, light, and shadow before. But here, his fabric innovationsdeveloped in collaboration with a company that specializes in recursive reflective paint, the type used in markers and signs at construction sitescame with a smattering of actually wearable shapes, a combination that promises to move beyond the purely conceptual and into actual closets. (Plus, it must be said: What a good party trick!)$$For a Spring season, theres been remarkably little heat on the runway. Its been one more or less sexless show after another, then along comes Anthony Vaccarello.  The Belgian-Italian designer, as his fans and his detractors like to say, never met a slit he didnt like, and in typical fashion this show was full of them. But there were also other things happening, new things that made this outing feel like Vaccarellos most diverse to date. Take, for instance, the T-shirt and tank dresses printed with a closeup of his friend and muse Anja Rubiks face. As they approached, it became clear that the dresses werent printed at all, but rather embellished with gradient clusters of studs depicting photographer Collier Schorrs portrait of the unmistakable model. Just think of the Instagram possibilities. Also novel: Tattoo prints on crisp white cotton button-downs. Vaccarello has a distinct point of view, and, until now, there hasnt been much room in it for such decorative motifs. But now that hes up and running at Versus Versacehe took his first solo bow there a week and a half agohes clearly set his mind to expanding the world of AV. To that end, he made a big push into denim, the entry-level price-point item that can really goose a brands bottom line. High-waisted styles, one accessorized with a denim belt that grazed the rib cage, will be about as forgiving as his hip-high slits, but there were loose-fitting boyfriend jeans in the mix that will appeal to a broader swath of body types.  Vaccarello also put his first bags on the runway. The gold detailing on a pair of cross-body styles echoed the hardware that accented this collections strong military-influenced tailoring and its drapey jersey numbers. Binx Walton, fashions tomboy du jour, looked terrific in the one-shoulder, asymmetric-skirt bathing suit dress. Best in show, however, goes to Edie Campbells fitted officers jacket and sexy black jeans.$$Antonio Berardis stated theme for Spring was distressed glamour. He got at it best at his show this morning via his use of transparency and his lacing and fringe. The strongest look, by far, was a knit dress with a leotard-like top and a full skirt in a cobweb weave; it was a bit of a shame he didnt explore that idea further. But there were other similar, nearly as nice touches, such as the pieces composed in part of a knit done out of shiny, filament-fine yarn or window-paned in sheer chiffon. Meanwhile, the most focused part of this collection were the looks in black crepe that featured skin-winking lacing that spilled out in fringe. Much of the action here was going on in the back of these looks. Many of Berardis diaphanous dresses and skirts came with long trains, and a number of jackets tailored through the front opened up in back in soft pleats. There were also evening coats with internal crystal straps that allowed the coats to be slung off the shoulders like a backpack, a design nicked from activewear. That wasnt a bad idea, but it was one of several in this show that didnt seem fully thought through, certainly not in relation to the collection as a whole. Berardis intention throughout seemed to be to mix baroque formality with undone-looking or off-kilter shapes. There was an appealing collection hiding somewhere inside this busy outing, but overall it suffered from a too much of muchness.$$After pausing to give his wife, Patrizia, a fervently Italian squeeze (youd get slapped for that anywhere else), Antonio Marras contemplated his board and said: I start with the simple lines and the simple shapes. But in the end I think normality is too boring. I prefer eccentricity. As do the Marras-ophiles who flocked backstage after this well-received show. You can see why. Season in, season out, he delivers variations on a template, though with Marras, sameness is a virtue that reflects a depth of imagination, not its absence. His vision is dense, delightful, and particular to him. The Spring 16 collection was touched by the work of the state-imprisoned Soviet-era Armenian director Sergei Parajanov. The fruit left on the front row was a nod to Parajanovs 1969 film, The Color of Pomegranates; the broken-plate print on the first three looks reflected his work, while the richly dun palette, ornamented headpieces, and occasionally literal swerves into a broad-belted, full-skirted, folk-dress silhouette nodded to the culture Parajanov was persecuted for propagating. As was a carpet-backed set of 14 Styrofoam boulders twined to the ceiling, two of which were mysteriously elevated for a rush-to-the-cameras finale of models in refashioned vintage white shirts and dresses studded with stones and layered with embroidery. The mass of the collection was Marrass signature dervish concatenation of tiered apron dresses, full skirts, wide pants, and frock-coats splattered with broderie anglaise, embroidered patchwork, printed panels, beading, tweed, and sequined appliqus. There was a lovely fil coupe stamped with plated-print circles of tarnished gold, silver, and bronze. The shoes ran a gamut from fabulous wood-soled platform sandals to bullet-toed embellished sneakers. With very few exceptions, this was a collection that looked easy to wear but was hard not to stare at. As Marras put it: I like a lot of things, together.$$Anya Hindmarch likes to pack her shows full of very English fun and games: She has been known to build magic teacup rides into her runways, and once bussed in a full chorus of male choir singers dressed as road workers for her traffic-themed presentation. Hindmarchs fondness for all things British led her to the high street this season, and she incorporated the branding of some of the U.K.s best-loved stores into her tongue-in-cheek designs. If you grew up in London in the 80s, you might have recognized the saying emblazoned across a tote bag that read Never Knowingly Undersold as the tagline for the famed department store John Lewis. A pair of leather knee-highs was cleverly stamped with the logo for Boots, Englands answer to Duane Reade. Hindmarch showed that those cultural witticisms could be used in subtler ways, too, and the letters WHS (short for WHSmith, the popular British newsagent and stationery store) were repeated in a cool graphic pattern, which made for an unexpected take on logomania.  The humor in those everyday references will likely be lost on Anya Hindmarch fans outside of British borders, though. Still, the designer didnt lose the smiley faces from her handbags altogether. The bite-sized additions to the collection, like mini soda-can key ring purses, will surely tickle the fancy of accessories fanatics the world over.$$When Apiece Apart launched in 2008, its organizing principle was modularity. Designers Laura Cramer and Starr Hout wanted all their clothes to mix and match togethernot just within collections, but between seasons and over the years. What those modular clothes lacked in romance they more than made up for in durability: Longtime Apiece Apart fans will attest that they still wear looks from the earliest collections. Modularity is no longer the organizing principle of the label. Cramer and Hout have loosened the reins on their concept over the years, making clothes that are versatile and un-faddish but that impart some emotional resonance. They hit a sweet spot this season, drawing on Luis Barragns emotional architecture for inspiration. Cramer and Hout have long hewed to the look of Mexico and the Southwest, and the elements of those aesthetics that they drew on here fit organically into the established Apiece Apart vernacular. The tonal embroidery and hand-crochet in this collection was new for the brand, but it didnt feel that way. The designers also worked in proven silhouettes, giving them just a touch of an updatethe easy dresses that could be cinched or worn loose continued an idea they debuted for Resort, while the ruffled crop tops made for a flirty reiteration of one of their most popular shapes. The real development was in the knits. Alongside the excellent fine-cotton ribsanother continuation from Resortwere sweaters with lacelike texture and engineered knit pieces emblazoned with graphic stripes. The engineered knit tube skirt and matching ruffled bandeau was a look with terrific pop, and it made for a nice counterpoint to the gauziness of the collection overall. Even the punchiest items still read as staples that would wear well over the yearsyou could even see them paired with pieces from the Apiece Apart debut.$$With the exception of committing factual error to publication, the hollowest feeling a fashion critic can experience is the sensation of tacking against the wind of consensus. For, at its essence, fashion is a tautly wrought tumbleweed of aesthetic agreement. So if everyone says A when you feel B about C, does that make you a Z? And, like, OMG? This Aquilano.Rimondi collection prompted a mild shiver of that unlovely sensation. Good luck with that, said one powerful tastemaker as we bundled toward the door after this show. Last-chance saloon, summated another as we bundled preshow toward it. Yet the most damning thing these eyes observed about this collection was the odd flash of meh. The idea of wearing paillette miniskirts as oomphed-up belts over long-yolked menswear shirts wasnt deeply flatteringthe tip of the yolk dangled unfortunately. The shirts themselves, though, were excellent, especially an endearing short-sleeved one with proper dress shirt cuffs. There were some interesting takes on the nightie/sleep slip as outwear. ARs versions were scalpel sliced, and when there came ruffle, it was applied with a more censoriously resistant eye to abandon than most designers have succumbed to this season: minimal romantic. The transliteration of Warhol florals to paillette reliefs was efficiently OK. And the X-ray white organza jacket that revealed the skeleton of its tailoring was strong, yet even better when fully opaque and black. AR seems to be languishing under a reputational cloud, but this collectionwhile no life changersignaled shafts of sunlight.$$It may be the labels first season with a slot on the New York Fashion Week show roster, but Area sure knows how to make an entrance. The brainchild of Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk, today the brand took over an airy room at The Standard and set their vision to life with an uncanny 70s beauty ad writ large. Makeup was, in fact, Springs prcis, as seen through the lens of some kind of gauzy, disco daydream. Doe-eyed, faintly dazed-looking models milled around vanity tables; silk dresses came encrusted with smudges of silvery glitter and glossy nude foundation smears, and baroque slippers with Perspex heels were . . . just plainly beautiful. Glitter or no, chromes got to shine too, so the designers whipped up the blush tire-rim print seen on a textured cream trench. Elsewhere they proposed plunging, wrap-front minis and lithe maxi dresses befitting Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface: one of the iridescent mesh gowns would look great on the red carpet. The spare clothes that Fogg and Panszczyk (alums of Calvin Klein Collection and Emanuel Ungaro, respectively) create, and the Braille-like embossing that has been their signature since the brands 2013 inception, resulted in a generally sporty, lean aesthetic. But this outing was one that showed a new dimension. Opening Ceremony was an early retail coup for the brand: After today, other tastemakers are sure to follow suit.$$Its been a big week for Arthur Arbesser, one of Milans new generation of designers. Last Friday, he presented his first collection for the Italian sportswear company Iceberg, and today, an hour before his longtime former employer Giorgio Armani put on his own show, Arbesser took his young eponymous brand to the runway for the first time. There was already a sense of occasion. It was a fact Arbesser opted to accentuate by recruiting his friend, the composer and musician Jordan Hunt, to play live music, and by installing in the middle of the room a giant Balthus cat and a young woman who played the artists model on a low velvet chair. Balthuss favorite subjects were adolescent girls, and Arbesser used the famous painters oeuvre as a framework. The models hair was scraped carelessly to the side with bobby pins, and they wore white anklets with both their patent slingbacks and their Nikes. The pubescent edge-of-innocence thing can go dreadfully wrong. Its a tribute to Arbessers sensitive spirit, and that of his collaborators, that it didnt. At 33, hes fairly youthful himself; he gets how young women want to dress. A paper-thin technical nylon coat and matching pants brought a sleek, athletic edge to the collection that felt genuine. But the stars were illustrator Agathe Singers lovely prints. If the naive cat motif on a pair of overalls and a raincoat wont be for everyone, the lively floral that appeared on a flirty little dress, a pantsuit, and a long-sleeved T-shirt gown will find admirers well past their teenage years. This writer can attest to that.$$The pile of sequins scattered haphazardly atop a bench caught Ashish Guptas eye as he and his team were in the studio doing research: I thought they just looked beautiful, the designer said. So, he thought, why try and impose order when disorder looks so great? Thus this Ashish collection memorably preambled with a group of girls who skated the runway variously wearing DIY-touched tracksuits, a slip skirt, a frayed and washed denim T-shirt, and lairy-fairy dresses wreathed in tulle. Like nigh on every look in his Spring 2016, theirs were speckled and heaped with Ashishs random-on-purpose drifts of candy-tone sparkle. They also emanated a pleasing Larry Clarkish truculenceattitude, basically. Then the show-run started in earnest with another ka-boom. On the left was Larry B, the London DJ; on the right was Jay Boogie; the man in Look 2 is Maximillian. The crowd whooped even harder. When they got to the end of the runway, they initiated what became another walk-the-floor flourish that ran through the show by tossing handfuls of sequins at the crowd. Later Larry came out again in a spaghetti-strap slip illustrated with some pertinent details. Ashish explained: I always want my shows to be a celebration of subcultures. And I felt that Larrys dress was an important statement in the context of Caitlyn Jenner, but also racial issues, too. This was a show in which the overwhelming message was its rejection of categories through inclusion: Because were all just little sparkles, jumbled together. There were some striking outfits in here, toothe one-piece hybrids of sari and jeans, most lovablybut that message was the thing.$$Its all well and good to talk about the 70s, 80s, and 90s, but theres a generation of young designers who were raised on Y2K values. The trashy, moody bad girls of the turn of the millennium loomed large in Ashley Williamss imagination for Spring, a motley crew of fictional and real-life characters that started with Emily the Strange and ended with Avril Lavigne.  The 27-year-old designer has a soft spot for a skaters wardrobeher boyfriend, Palace Skateboards founder Lev Tanju, sat in the front rowalthough this season the vibe was more Camden Market goth does Black Swan, and PVC trenchcoats came emblazoned with a tag that read Ashley Williams Ballet School and were worn with black tutus, demented tiaras, and fishnet tights. That unapologetically brazen attitude also speaks to the aesthetic of a certain stylish bad gal of our times, and you can imagine Rihanna strutting her stuff in one of Williamss No Code of Conduct tees or in her slip dress printed with flies and laced up in neon straps. After an age of buttoned-up minimalism, its an exuberant and cheeky sexiness that cool young girls can relate to right now. The striped and pointy elf hats, though, are perhaps a tad too bad to be good.$$Greg Armas usually has a self-described meta backstory when it comes to his collections. This time, he focused on bringing back the wardrobes of disappeared heroines. I started finding that a lot of interesting academic psychic, explorer, and adventurous avatar-type of individuals seem to disappear, said Armas. The classic examples were Amelia Earhart and Maria Orsic. A hefty narrative, which of course raises the question: What would the mysteriously vanished duo wear? Their closets were surprisingly pared back. Armas reimagined Earharts look the day she disappeared as a slouchy white jumpsuit and a trenchcoat with an oversize collar. More utilitarian and aviator influences were referenced in loose cotton trousers and a paisley bomber jacket. As for Orsic, a stunning German medium who performed sances during World War II and eventually disappeared in 1945, her hypnotic staples included a romantic crepe twist top with naval-skimming dcolletage and cascading shorts, as well as a slinky red silk maxi dress. When it came to Armass use of denim, the personal styles of the two women merged more closely. Think indigo denim overalls for Earhart and a set of optic white wide-leg denim trousers for Orsic; a loose chambray shirtdress, meanwhile, could have been worn by either muse. There was also a pair of jeans patchworked with vintage squares of varying washes, each hailing from a different decadea piece that could work for any woman with a modern-day-daredevil sartorial flair.$$For Tony Melillo, it all goes back to the T-shirt. He started his line, ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo, just under four years ago with a tightly edited range of tees, tanks, and sweats in neutral shades of white and black. While his business has since grown to reach every corner of the modern girls wardrobe, from leather joggers to work-ready suits, the concept of the perfect T-shirt is still the heart of the brand. Shoppers who discover ATM at department stores like Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue collect the drapey Modal tees by the armful, and this season Melillo introduced the Schoolboy tee, a boxy, slightly androgynous cut that lends itself perfectly to high-rise jeans. But even Melillos more high-concept pieces are designed with the T-shirt in mind: A shimmering charcoal parka in his Spring lineup was actually made of coated jersey, so the slick, high-shine exterior had a soft, familiar interior. Similarly, ATMs sharp suits were constructed from textured woven fabrics instead of stiff wool, and they were paired withwhat else?T-shirts, not blouses. Relaxed elegance is how Melillo described his point of view: It was easy for us to go into all these categories [after starting with T-shirts], as crazy as it may seem. We just stayed true to the brand identity.  As such, Melillos collections are more about luxurious, wearable clothes than specific references. But Spring was loosely based on the art of travel: People always say ATM is perfect for traveling, so I was thinking about what a chic traveler would wear, he said. That isnt to suggest you should hit the airport in heels; rather, Melillos ribbed-knit sweatpants would look sleek, not sloppy, with white sneakers and, say, one of his neoprene blazers, which would bounce back after being stuffed into your carry-on. Of course, his supersoft tees, which are manufactured in Peru, are perfect not only for planes, trains, and automobiles, but for every aspect of your daily life, too, which is certainly a sweet spot to be in.$$It was extra-unfortunate that the branding of Dashthe Italian detergent that Au Jour Le Jour signed a deal with to sponsor this show, and whose logos were incorporated into the collectionwas so deeply reminiscent of Fresh, the new fragrance launched at Moschino on Thursday. Moschino has long been the don of ironic, Pop Art appropriation of mass-branding into high fashion, and although the AJLJ efforts to service its sponsors (logoed boots, a finely produced knit miniskirt and shirt, and some spangly slip dresses) were cute, the advertorial nature of the exercise undermined it. The point of Moschino, for house founder Franco and current designer Jeremy Scott, presumably was and is designing clothes to say something, not just get paid. Still, the collection was lively. The schtick, consistent with the sponsor (Dash!) was stains. So sequined jeans, vests, and black suede boots appeared splattered by scarlet ketchup. An opening section of sixties-eque mock croc color-blocked tartan suits and shifts worn over organza shirts were prettily polluted by more sequin stains of coffee and blood. Splodges were turned into camouflage, oozing contra-colored gloop ran down in panels on more colored faux croc and enamel stains were dripped onto paillette minis. As street style fare this was good fun, but the biggest stain in a collection full of them was that overly articulated commercial transaction.$$Audra Danielle Noyes is a young designer, having made her way nearly straight from her studies at Savannah College of Art and Design to Paris, where she cut her teeth at Lanvin and John Galliano. And so her Spring prcis was one no doubt informed by her own experiences, which delved deeply into the metamorphosis of a young woman. That idea came to life specifically in the notion of searching for freedom within control. An airy striped cotton silk jacquard, she explained at a preview, nodded to the strings of a marionette; a peplumed top with a cutout toyed with the idea of vulnerability. At times that reference felt slightly labored; you didnt need multilayered conceits to appreciate Noyess winning marriage of American sportswear and demi-couture sensibilities. To wit: a delicate trench in nude and blush with a full skirt, or a grouping made up of panels of various shapes, shades, and opacity. The latter were some of the collections loveliest pieces.  With their generous volumes and polished brand of eccentricity, Noyess clothes are sure to find fans among women who arent afraid of a flounce or a bold sleeve. But that sensibility also gave way to plenty of versatile styles to round out the collection. The designer has a real talent for feminine riffs on suiting. Look no further than her windowpane cropped flares and slouchy blazer for evidence of that. Shirting likewise was an emphasis; tailored poplin pieces served as a counterpart to Noyess balloon-sleeved shifts and sculptural skirts. There was a certain innocence heresome of it intentional and some, you imagined, a by-product of the newness of the line that made you keen to see whats next for Audra.$$Bali or bust! Awaveawakes Spring 16 collection served as a lush testament to time spent on the Indonesian island. Designer Jaclyn Hodes didnt lose sight of her m.o. of organically luxe styles or allow the trip to set her adrift on a sea of the tangential. Instead, like last seasons Jaipur-hued outing, it served as a lens through which to subtly reinterpret all the things that have earned her label its following: the languid, bias-cut slip dresses and the tops and skirts made for layering (informed by Hodess work as a stylist). There was plenty of lightness to be had here. The substantial-feeling lushness of washed silk charmeuse has long been a hallmark of Awaveawake, but in the interest of retail in the warmer months, Hodes diffused her signature material with styles in easy-to-wear, easy-to-care-for cotton. Elsewhere, Falls hardy cowl-neck sweatshirt came to feminine new life in a floral lace. The designers clothes have an undeniably earthy, even holistic quality to them, but with sophistication to spare. To wit: Springs apron dress, with its lithe, body-skimming shape and plunging back. With pieces like that, shell make a sensualist out of every one of us yet.$$On a flight not long ago, Babyghost designers Joshua Hupper and Qiaoran Huang, seated separately, both watched Ultrasuede. The Halston documentary set their minds to the idea of making a Spring collection in homage to the great man. Still, Hupper says the two were fully aware of their potential to get overzealous, so rather than going full-throttle Studio 54, this season they asked themselves: What if we were trying to do this Halston collection for the Gap? That idea didnt necessarily come through so much in the final product (Babyghosts clothes have plainly too much of a point of view and too much idiosyncrasy to channel Gap in any palpable way), but it seemed to serve them well. Despite the season, this was a deliciously Goth-y lineup, light in feel if not in reference. The duo was inspired by Death, Clarence E. Flynns poem personifying the Big Sleep as a friendly force (Why do you fear me? it begins. I am your friend). So much so, in fact, that it came stitched in its entirety, along with an elegiac-looking depiction of Death on sheer tops and frocks. Most beautiful of all was on the transparent front panel of a twill skirt; the undersides of its seams came dappled with gold lam spots in a nod to Halston. The designers resisted other direct 70s references in favor of that and the transparent confetti-filled (thats Studio 54, natch) buttons on a printed shirt. All those were nice feats unto themselves, but still, Babyghosts most commendable move this season was one of self-awareness. Hupper: We want to make clothing [girls] want, not clothing we want them to wear. That meant wisely continuing to pare back the disparate graphic elements that have characterized Babyghost in seasons past in favor of bewitching, more basic pieces. The pair also debuted a lower-priced range, dubbed Stashhouse (muse, stylist, and Babyghost international playgirl Xiao Wen Ju was wearing one of the bombers at last nights presentation). It was the kind of strong effort that left you, if not undaunted by the reaper, keen to see what next season will bring.$$Buenos Aires of the 50s? Mark Badgley and James Mischka may have never made it there themselves, having been born several years too late, but the red carpet stalwarts imagined that milieu through a romantics lens as the basis of their Spring lineup. From the suntanned skin that the designers said informed a blush-heavy palette to the butterflies and flora, here was a depiction of B.A. straight out of some dreamy tourist brochure. Idealized, but never kitsch, the pair embraced their prcis wholeheartedly, integrating it into the labels classic silhouettes, beautifully tailored by day and very sensual and elegant by night, as Mischka put it backstage pre-show. The tailoring came to life with a swingy, warm-weather tweed shorts suit, the nighttime mood in a hothouse-looking floral lace gown and a metallic brushstroke jacquard. Backstage the designers offered that while their autumnal fabrics skew toward the more heavily encrusted, here was a relatively breezy profusion of frothy, lightweight tulles, chiffons, and georgettes. Gold foil butterflies on a blush tulle gown had a certain heady charm to them. Still, generally Badgley and Mischkas simplest propositions spoke the loudest: to wit, the plunging ivory top and gold beaded trousers, or a little caped black cocktail dress with a waterfall of bugle bead strands that cascaded down the back. Though if youre looking for an everyday shift for the office, well . . . look elsewhere. Our day starts at 5 p.m., Mischka laughed backstage, while Helen Mirren, sitting front row, called out an unapologetically glam strapless gown in white and metallic gold floral jacquard as her most coveted look.$$There was a buzz at todays Baja East show. Common, Miguel, and Mariska Hargitay were seated front row, and while the brands shows have historically been well attended since its inception (just two years ago), there was a noticeably higher showing of the industrys top faces. For Spring, designers Scott Studenberg and John Targon reimagined their signature urban nomad through the lens of rave, down to the polished take on kandi seen at models wrists and necks. Where the past has seen the Baja East palette go sun-bleached and spare, todays was a veritable riot of parrotlike shades, red, chiefly, but saturated blues and greens, too. Those all came to life in a punchy tie-dye print (weve seen a rash of the stuff at the shows already, but none so graphic as this take), spotted on silk caftans. That print was mirrored in the many, many multicolored, bingo granny bling Swarovski crystals covering white sweatshirts and tees. There was also a terrific multihued crochet, dappled with iridescent sequins. Backstage pre-show, Studenberg said that, ambisexual brand or not, roughly 90 percent of Bajas business is womens. As such, starting with Resort the designers have been increasing their focus on proper womens clothesthat is to say, less loungy pieces to complement those cashmere ponchos. Here, that yielded a tuxedo-style ivory dress with a knotted belt that came scattered in more Swarovski. There was even soft tailoring in the form of a scarlet blazer with a slim shawl collar. Bajas fortunes look promising: Theyre CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists, in key doors globally, and a growing name within the industry. Now, Studenberg and Targon are in the market for a key investor. The heightened commercial appeal of todays outing was a step toward that, and from the looks of it, the designers feel good about their odds: Both they and their models took a post-show victory lap, dancing all the way.$$Alexander Wangs three-year stint at Balenciaga is over. He went out dancing, snapping selfies and twirling down the runway. His swan song was the freest of any of the collections he did for the house, and the most tender. All in shades of ivory. All paraded softly out on lace slippers. All in soft, natural fabrics like linen, cotton, and voile with gentle, furling edges. It looked effortless, where the ones that preceded it felt effortful.  Work began on this collection after the announcement was made that Wang and Balenciagas parent company Kering would not be renewing his contract. At the time Wang said hed be refocusing his attentions on his signature label. Maybe that awareness loosened him up. Maybe he really hunkered down, determined to go out on a high note. Whichever, its no small irony that his last and best collection for the brand was the one that was truest to his own bred-in-California sensibilities. A remix of The Notorious B.I.G.s iconic Going Back to Cali played on the soundtrack. Bella Heathcote, Riley Keough, Zo Kravitz, and other Hollywood friends of his with normal-sized, not overly thin bodies grounded the show in reality. Loungewear was at its soul, with boxer shorts peeking above waistlines and bra tops exposed under quilted jackets.  As relaxed as its vibes were, a good deal of work went into the collections smocking, ruching, and ladder stitching, and yet it remained light. When you know its your last anything, you say, Lets take a risk, what do you have to lose? Wang said backstage. At a house thats known for innovation, I thought, Lets think about it the opposite way, lets think about fabrics and shapes that feel supple and simple, but approach them in an artisanal, couture way.  Following Nicolas Ghesquire, the innovator Wang was referring to, had to be one of the toughest jobs in fashion. As Wang sped back down the runway tonight he nearly tripped over one of the shows reflecting pools before catching himself and continuing backstage. It was a pointed image. His own show was bigger than ever and one of the highlights of the New York calendar. The question isnt how Wang will fare now, but how Balenciaga will pick up the momentum again.$$There was a glint of genius in Pablo Coppolas context-setting question for this collection, which ran: What will the bourgeois woman in 20 years time want to wear? Why genius? Well, the bourgeois woman of today is wearing a 90s-touched but 70s-heavy constellation of signifiers upgraded by the appropriation of post-sportswear streetwear. So it follows that a woman 20 years on will wear something heavily touched by whatever hindsight dictates is nowright nowin 2015/16, shot through with a lot from the 90s and made relevant by technology and trends that we cant even begin to anticipate. Were Coppola able to answer his question he would have discovered the Holy Grailfashions Flux Capacitora way to short-circuit the self-referential cycle of retrospection and push on into Where We Really Are. The essence of Now. So, did he?  It would, of course, be impossible to be truly sure, but this didnt look like a bad bet. A double-breasted shirtdress, full length in heavy silk crepe, bore the six-buttoned imprint of functions pastabout as useful as an appendix yet reassuring somehowin a fundamentally minimal garment. The cream suiting had a flecked rustication to its finishCoppola said the intention had been to ape the raggedness of a toile but made ready-to-wear. Not in the lookbook but well worth a look were silk-mix bombers in olive and blush pink with cutely pop-openable backs to flash the spine, that ideally genderless, post fourth-wave feminism erogenous zone. There were foulard prints and hand-finished fringing and suspiciously perfect moth holes that were all inserted to heighten the sense of a garment crafted by hand. Next to the main collection, workers from Ballys recently acquired exotic leather atelier had been brought in to emphasize this still further. Inauthentically, however, their day-to-day tools had been confiscated for being too aesthetically unpleasing. One poor chap was heating his edging iron on a scented candle instead of a Bunsen burner.  The testing is now complete at Bally: It is time to go from beta to full-release. Coppola has found his stride, and the 164-year-old Swiss brands new David Chipperfield retail proposition has had a year to bed on Bond Street. It will be rolled out in 12 international locations over the next 12 monthsfirst stop, Los Angeles. With collections such as these to fill them, Ballys new stores will feel relevant in 2016. And perhaps in years hence, too.$$Olivier Rousteings Balmain show has become such a magnet for fans and paparazzi that the police shut down the street outside the entrance to his Hotel Intercontinental venue today. Without Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West in the front row, the scene inside was much more subdued than last season. Rousteings own social media fame may not be at the level of the Kardashian clan, but when it comes to designers, few can touch him. Only Jeremy Scott and Riccardo Tisci come close.  His online following made him an ideal candidate for the H&M collaboration going on sale next month, a point Rousteing made explicit in his notes: While this 15-minute presentation is designed to create strong impressions and reactions, its during the upcoming six months when the designs will make their mark. Social medias embrace of Balmain will provide us with daily reminders of the excitement of those who have found a new way to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Implicit in that statement was a riposte to his fashion-world detractors, of which there will likely be many after todays show.  Rousteing toned down the color this season to focus on shades of nude, but there was no equivalent dialing-back of the embellishments that have weighed down his recent collections. The macram was as full-on as ever, and often in crystals or beads, and the tiered ruffles were even more flamboyant than last seasons silk pliss. Those ruffles notwithstanding, the silhouette was super clingy, loaded with cutouts and sheer paneling, and cinched with waist trainersize belts. Joan Smalls slithered down the runway in short, stretchy green suede, the shows best look, but the restrictive, tight-fitting tube skirts gave other models problems. As excessive as it all came off at todays show, these clothes look great in pictures. Rousteings macram really resonates on a tiny iPhone screen; the proof is in the Spring 16 outfits Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid wore last night on the town in Paris. #BalmainBooties and #BalmainBeauties temporarily replaced #BalmainArmy as Rousteings hashtag du jour. Who needs gatekeepers? The guys going to sell millions at H&M.$$Creative director Marissa Webb is pushing Banana Republic in a new direction, meaning revamped patterns and new textures for both womenswear and menswear. In another important switch-up for the label, this collection also represented BRs first partnership with the CFDA, via a collaboration with New York designer Timo Weiland and partners Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang. All the changes were noticeable. For womenswear, Webb refreshingly shook up her pattern palette with a polished cream jumpsuit, which came in a blotted, watercolor floral print. A pair of wide-leg trousers striped in white and aqua offered a subdued cool. There was also a look in biting pink scale hues that caught the eyea striped salmon topper thrown over a lavender pleated frock. But it was Webbs focus on suiting that packed an understated and chic punch without a deliberate, changed-up feel. An off-white slouchy jacket and trouser set, as well as a jacket that was rendered into a vest, were both casual enough to be worn as separates with jeanssomething that Webb was also aiming for.  Likewise, suiting received a makeover when it came to menswear. A manicured downtown approach was seen in a dandy-style shorts suit with a fitted double-breasted jacket that included a pocket square. For a more relaxed look, there was also a suede jacket paired with knee-skimming shorts.   One of the most refreshing additions came with Weilands work. There was an uptown elevation and a glossy take on prep that could translate for BR consumers outside of Weilands metropolitan home base. His riff on cocktail wear was great: a high-waisted, wide-pleated salmon skirt paired with a cropped tank and a sharp chambray shift dress. It was a good way for BR to infuse a dose of authentic city-side cool while also introducing new talent to the traditional customer.$$There is that rock n roll side, and a sexy suita little bit boyish, you know. Its what I love to do, gushed Barbara Bui, air-kissing German photographer Ellen von Unwerth backstage at her Spring show today. And if its what Barbara loves to do, then its what Ellen loves to photographsexy, uncomplicated clothes that do double-time as a flamboyant urban wardrobe for the jet set, or perhaps those aspiring to join it. Underscored as a love letter to Bianca Jagger, Buis Spring collection traced a racy through line going from urban tailored separates (safari-tinged shirtdresses and city shorts or their romper equivalents) to wrapped bra tops and leggings, all cut in supple leather. Her material of choice channeled a retro lan when patchworked as a harlequin snakeskin suit, or an 80s shock in hot pink napa. It would take little imagination to picture a young Jagger poolside in the former option, or one of the seasons silk slipdresses, trapped by sculpted corset belts at the waist, their plunging necklines revealing bikinis beneath. Later, Bui took a gaucho trip involving fringed ponchos in tan or aubergine suede, for a South American theme that evolved into silk fringed eveningwear the designer called night owl embroidery (a suit and gown were positively festooned with the stuff). Those pieces swung past, begging for serious dance-floor real estate, but its probably the no-fuss sex appeal of Buis daywear that will lure her ladies in. Hell for leather, if you will.$$Strong? Absolutely. Serene? No diggity. But can minimalism ever be sexy? While thats a pretty subjective questioneverythings something to someoneon the whole youd think: nope. Minimalisms (putatively) intellectual commitment to distillation of form and austerity of delivery is just too cold to be hot. Yet today, sometimes, that was sort of what Barbara Casasola was pitching for in this collection. And, impressively, she sometimes sort of succeeded. My woman is very sensual, she said post-show, and thats what I do is about. Her baseline daywear proposition starred loosely languid tailoring (smashing jackets), finely rendered silk bowling shirts, and some comely high-waisted silk pants that had the puckered texture of paper splashed with water and left to dry again. The hot stuff was a more ambitious series of fitted dresses and jumpsuits cast in polyester-spiked pliss taffeta and textured, knit silk. Although mostly either monochrome or day-spa dark rusty-neutral in tone, Casasola variously oomphed them up with Bardot necklines, grids of tiny incisions, cutaways at the abdomen, or lines of larger welts in the material that ran down the side of her outfits from shoulder to hem to achieve what the press notes coyly termed a fragile reveal. Casasola rather short-circuited this interplay between inhibition and abandon with a section that beachily whispered of her Brazilianness, most notably in a roughly woven full-length green skirt partnered with an (unreliable) bandeau and gleaming gold totem jewelry. This designer spent a few years at Roberto Cavalli, and although she correctly observed that his and her aesthetics are very differentoh, yesshe learned enough from the old devil to make this an at-times-effective exercise in date-night minimalism.$$An eight-day trip to England proved fertile ground for Barbara Tfank, who based her Spring 2016 collection, called My Journey, on the various sites she visited on her travels. Tfank and her husband were invited to lunch by a deputy speaker of the House of Lords, and the designer had a chance to visit the storied hall at the Palace of Westminster. I was so taken by the decor and these perfectly maintained 19th-century roomsthe ornateness of the wall treatments, the moldings and the fabrics, said Tfank. That lent itself organically to Tfanks textile-centric design sensibility: There were plenty of brocades tinged with metallic embroidery that would have looked just spiffy in an 1800s-era sitting room. Of course, thats not always an ideal thing: Theres a reason the palace is considered a historical site, and some of Tfanks creations came off a tad antiquated, an impression not helped by the upswept retro hairstyle. Her inspiration translated best on a pink-and-green brocade column gown with a back panel, a dress that reminded one of the kind of chintz curtains of the era and yet still somehow managed to feel fresh. Also fresh: a handful of evening separates, including a full brocade skirt with contrasting leather waistband, styled with a crop top that might entice some younger customers.$$Every season, we pick a destination, but this time, its Southern California, Los Angeleswere staying right here! Lubov Azria, in gray, post-summer NYC, thusly granted a final blissfully warm day with her BCBG Max Azria lineup. Surf, skate, musicthe ways California changed the world, but a new proposal.  First things first: More than a few front-rowers were Snapchatting (though with limited cell service inside Moynihan Station) the patchwork bucket hats. Yes, Azria has made the bucket hat cool again. Below the toppers, it was all layers, like embroidered vests, lightweight knits, tie-dyed T-shirts, and floor-dusting pants, some in twilight-hued blocked gradients: Ventura, with polish and smart styling.  At points, there was even a hint of Burning Man among all the Coachella, such as in the case of a metallic gold jacquard jacket. That may have been inspired by the Pacifics bronze glow on one of Azrias marathon training runs through Toluca Lake. With platform cutout-toe boots, cozy bits like knit leg warmers, and a few great beach dresses, it felt good to soak up the sun one last time.$$When there are two designers who run a labellet alone two siblingsyou cant help but wonder how often they clash behind the scenes. For Beaufilles Parris Gordon and Chlo Gordon, sisterly disagreements are inevitable, but their unique, lifelong bond also makes them ideal collaborators. Chlo, whose background is in textiles, knows which knits or tech fabrics will work best with Parriss hardware and jewelry (Parris studied metalsmithing), and vice versa. From there, the collection sort of unfolds organically, and Spring was particularly harmonious. In the past, we would think of really specific inspirations and start there, but now we kind of work backward, Parris explained. Were working more intuitively. Of Spring 16s sharp lines, silver ring cutouts, and high-tech materials, she said, We immediately thought it looked retro-futuristictheres a Star Warsin-the-70s quality. That mood came through best in a mid-length ivory slip dress with D-rings and trailing ribbons at the shoulders. Slips are a huge trend for Spring, but theyve been a Beaufille best-seller for a few seasons now. Elsewhere, the ring details became more prominent, creating pockets of air on a sleeveless jacket or dotting the curved edge of a dress. Cropped flares with chunky zippers also stood out; both the rust suede and black jersey varieties would give your favorite jeans a run for their money. In addition to that minimal, sculptural theme, there was an emphasis on more artisanal details, like a one-shoulder top that looked like it was made of tangled threads. Chlo handmade it by throwing bundles of yarn into water-soluble bags, pinning the strings together, and embroidering them over and over for hours at a time. Then she dunked the mass in a bathtub and watched the bags dissolve, so all that was left was the manipulated fabric. Consider it a modern take on lace or crochetwith just a touch of high tech.$$How better to purge any lingering associational residue of Belstaffs first luxury womenswear iterationwhich was just too hard, uptight, and uptown to be consistent with this free-wheeling biker brands identitythan with a vigorous salt wash? Delphine Ninous dappled this collection with a seascape print that featured on jacquard turtlenecks, reversible double-layer organza and shiny nylon bombers, and the opening asymmetrical silk dress. She had been thinking of the ocean and the elements and so forth, she said. This set the tone for a concerted exercise in softening through gentle erosion. Field jackets bore the utilitarian hoo-ha of military taping and poachers pockets but on treated linen or a silky, featherlight technical material worn over an earthy oatmeal Guernsey. The biker was recast in jersey-bonded stretch suede, a really impressive fabrication, with shoulder guards and small-of-the-back corrugations in lightly crackled leather. Matching pants, too. There was a sleeveless hybrid of dress and coat decorated with the neckline, quilting, hardware, and leather strapping of Ninouss materialswhich made for quite a muster of references. The designer confessed that a significant part of her role is to investigate this amazing archive of DNA from Belstaff and think, Okay, how can I tweak it?, but she is also empowered sometimes to roam off-road. After all, there was nothing biker in her wide lace-paneled white cotton pants, or in the fine entwined peep-toe sandals, orstrapping apartin the loose linen striped overcoats. And thats all for the good: Incorporating house codes makes a fine starting point, but from there on its time to take off.$$Bernhard Willhelms latest collection was totally bananas. Literally: Bananas were Willhelms inspiration this season, and his clothings key motif. There were embroidered banana designs elaborated with loops of fringe, a print of a man eating a banana, three-dimensional banana appliqus, and more. The bananas were ludicrousnot to mention suggestivewhich was precisely Willhelms point. The designer was celebrating randomness in this ostentatiously cheerful outing, which featured lots of sliced and distressed square-cut clothes, and zero instances of the color black.  Willhelm was being playful, but his is serious play. To engage with his clothes means engaging with the idea that people could dress in a way far removed from what we see on the street today. The naivet of his methodsthe knotting and slashing and seemingly improvisational drapingas well as his touches of applied damage, like dip-dye or shredded hems, all together suggested a uniform worked out spontaneously by a lost tribe of club kids who had decided to make a society of their own, from scratch. In said society, gender is a nonissueyou wear what you likeand it just so happens that one of the members of this new utopia is a master maker of intarsia knits, with access to hand-embroiderers in India and placement printers in Japan. Which is a roundabout way of noting that Willhelms clothes may look bananas, but the designer himself is not. Theres both method and sophistication to his madness.$$The Betsey Johnson show is always an over-the-top extravaganza, an unhinged get-together, and a wild culmination of many inspirations. Today there was another raging party backstagea clamor of models in sky-high heels and bass-thunking raps by Azealia Banks. But though Johnson was in her vivacious element, she still paid attention to some serious themes: the 73-year-old designer pulled out a tank top with an American flag on it that she designed in 2001. Its for 9/11. Ive saved it all these years, she said. Im going to wear it for the fireman. After all, Johnson has seen a lot in her time as a designerand today was also a celebration of her 50 years in the fashion industry. On top of that, there was a point person she had to thank, as well. Two hours before the show, Johnson arranged a car to pick up her 94-year-old dance instructor, Ann Pimm, to attend the show. Ive dedicated the show to her, said Johnson. I studied with her forever and she brought me to New York to study. With dance as the theme, as well as her five decades of experience in the industry, Johnson squeezed half a century onto the runway. The first looks were set in the present, with Nicki Minajesque pieces like a bubblegum corseted tutu dress on top of a neon blue net shirt. As for the 90s, Johnson gave grunge a playful riff with rose-patterned tutu dresses fastened with blue corsets paired with cherry print tights. There was also the rock attitude of the 80s, which included jumpsuits with punchy pinstripes, and a very cool plastic jacket outfitted with zippers on the sleeves.  But it was the 60s that introduced the most wearable looks. There was a strong Twiggy influence in a mod-style Mandarin-collar striped pantsuit, as well as a polka-dotted minidress with an oversize collar and sleeves. Baring some skin, there was a slinky violet dress with the naval-skimming dcolletage opening bound by mini bows. The last looks, which hailed from the 50s, were the most sentimental: Johnson designed the pieces based on her original dance costumes as a child. There were charming, nude leotards adorned with mini frills at the waist and striped with sequins, as well as a bedazzled red crop top and a pleated miniskirt. For the grand finale, before Johnson did her traditional cartwheel, she handed Pimm a bouquet of flowers. Then she was followed by models in leotards printed with American flags, proving that the designer always remembers the important things.$$Im a very emotional designer, Bibhu Mohapatra said before his Spring 2016 show. Whether its a fabric or a material or an artisan story, I hold on to them until it feels right. As a counterpoint to last season, when Mohapatra was mourning the loss of his father, the designer wanted this collection to be much more spirited and celebratory. He chose as his muse Annemarie Schwarzenbach, a woman who has long held his fascination and whom the designer felt embodied the joie de vivre of the collection. Schwarzenbach was a trailblazera glamorous and itinerant journalist and photographer who was known for her singular androgynous style in 30s Europe. But she also died young, at the age of 34. She had a short but very impactful life, and thats something to be celebrated, said Mohapatra. Instead of riffing on Schwarzenbachs menswear-influenced personal stylewhich would have strayed too far from the brands core aestheticMohapatra instead opted to infuse his feminine and sophisticated silhouettes with elements of Bauhaus, the school of art that Schwarzenbach subscribed to. Mohapatra beautifully captured that modernist and geometric style in his prints, many of which were inspired by discarded Bauhaus drawings. Highlights included a warped circle print that repeated itself on tops and dresses, and an overblown multicolored design, iridescent with sequins, that appeared on dresses and pants. Elsewhere Mohapatra incorporated elements of the schools architectural aesthetic. Thigh-high slits were effectively updated by squaring off the opening at the topa nice graphic touch. Dresses and tops had structure and often were sliced to reveal surprising panels of tulle and silk organza. Mohapatra is also emotionally invested in the fabrics he uses and the artisans he works with: The designer could barely suppress his excitement backstage when showing a jacket constructed from thin strips of leather and silk that was hand-woven in Laos. Surprisingly delicate, and fascinating to look at up close, the fabrication was certainly worth the fuss.$$In the wake of founder Johan Lindebergs departure back in May, BLK DNM has opted to move forward without appointing a successor, instead leaving design duties up to the studio team. Lindebergs vision for the brand has left them a concrete aesthetic vernacular to be built upon; Spring 16 marks his last season, a collection handled in part by him and in part by the in-house talents. Here, Lindebergs chief preoccupationsfreewheeling 60s and 70s rock n roll sensibilities quintessentially embodied by everyone from Keith Richards and Gram Parsons to Patti Smithcame to life in wearable, 21st-century ways.  There was plenty of common ground between this and the seasons menswear offering, and why not? Chances are the BLK DNM girls beau dresses as well as (if not better than) she does. Consider a whiskey-color jacket decked out in yards of fabulous, shuddering fringe; that same fabrication came to life as a sweet, Jane Birkinesque shift, too. Quiet touches like pony beads, spotted dangling off the zips of a leather jacket, were proof that the devil is in the detailsand that those details add appeal that goes a long way in setting BLK DNMs takes on well-trod iconic pieces apart from the pack. Likewise, tailoring has always been a strong suit of the lines, and the revival of an old silhouettethe terrific shawl-collar Blazer 32could scarcely be more timely: Not long before the launch of this collection, Kendall Jenner was spotted out and about in a vintage iteration of the style.$$A house fondness for bloom-bordered sheerness makes Blumarine a show thats relished by the bawdy band of runway photographersits their Friday morning double espresso. Outside the pit, however, that emphasis on garlanded nudity can feel unsettlingly anachronistic. Yet to be understood, Blumarine needs first to be examined in terms of its anthropology. Anna Molinaris line reflects an Italian sensibility, a Chi magazine (Italy's answer to Us Weekly) reader's raunch-touched interpretation of ethereal romance that Blumarine, fueled by its original success in knitwear manufacturing, gave rise to.  And the audience at todays show was ample evidence that this constituency is still in fine fettle. Thus the screen-print stemmed-rose-silhouette tulle skirts, shirts, and gowns, sometimes monochrome, sometimes in a reduced-rainbow palette accented with stripes. A jacket of pastel-sequined camouflagedesigned to help you blend out of the backgroundwas worn over a flower-appliqud silk smock in violet beach stripe and some superwide, cut-at-the-side, pink Bengal-stripe pants. Those pants pointed to the unexpected element in this lineup. Just as Rodolfo Paglialunga did for his debut Jil Sander collectionSpring 201512 months ago, team Blumarine turned to the completely fabulous, androgynous-dressing, progenitor Swiss photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach for its thematic inspiration. Schwarzenbach very much is a now-appropriate cipher, and the interpretation of her here was expressed in high-cut, loosely pocketed, hardware-shorn field jacketbiker hybridsand those pants. This was Blumarines nod to gender fluidity, and along with the masculine accent of that Bengal stripe, it reflected a sincere effort to flavor the house cocktail with a fresh dose. In chambray especially, and black satin up to a point, it kind of convinced. Although the photographers were disappointed.$$Julianne Moore wore a Le Smokingstyle jumpsuit by Bosss Jason Wu at the Toronto International Film Festival last weekend. She looked fantastic. The strapless black jumpsuit reappeared on the runway this afternoon, but its formality meant it was an outlier in Wus new collection for the German brand. Now in his fourth runway season, hes focused on growing the Boss universe: To do so, he focused mostly on daywear of the decidedly breezy variety for Spring.  To start he gave the Boss suit a makeover, elongating the jacket, hacking off the sleeves, and adding fringe to the lapels; full trousers were cropped above the ankle. The tailoring felt airier than his previous work here and freer, even when the jackets had full sleeves. The same goes for his dresses. Who knows why, but Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have emerged as a significant New York trend, not only on the runways, but also on the street. Wu used them to winning effect, cutting delicate sleeveless dresses in bright shades of flame red, cobalt, and lemon yellow organza. Their split skirts and handkerchief hems swirled weightlessly as they came down the runway. Until now Wu has avoided prints at Boss. Giving them a go today, he experimented with an etched, gray-tone floral. It felt a bit anemic side by side with the Bauhaus colors of the pleated dresses. A pair of sheaths in a two-tone woven tweed with frayed edges were bolder. All in all, an assured outing.$$The great outdoors was calling this morning at Bottega Veneta. Its Indian summer here in Milan, and everyone working in the city is trying to hold on to that serene vacation mood while the sunshine lasts. So is Tomas Maier, it seems, as he showed a collection inspired by big country, open air, trekking, and sailing. The farther he can get from an urban environment, he says, the better it gets. With the exception of teenagers, most everybody can relate to that impulse, and Bottega Veneta has never been for the underage anyway. Maiers self-appointed task is to get inside the desires of women with money to spend, and for Spring he is persuading them to crave more casual clothes. He opened with looks evolved from tracksuits, with zippered jackets and cropped pants; throughout his daywear, he wove a brownish-green camouflage theme patched in with leopard print. On the feet: flat loafers, thong sandals, and clogs. Still, theres no avoiding the fact that Bottega Venetas customers must eventually face the city and its various social occasions. So for the urban jungle, there was a tailored pantsuit and blouse printed in Maiers abstract camo patternnot exactly designed for merging into the background but rather for standing out from the herd as a bold fashion-adopter (printed pantsuits have been head-turners at Gucci, Versace, and Roberto Cavalli, too). There was one intricately pieced red leather and python coat and several patchworked shift dresses that radiated the kind of highly crafted exclusiveness Bottega Veneta fans love. What do you do when you want to bring a sense of the big outdoors to party dresses, though? Maiers solution: frocks in techno-cottons, ingeniously wrapped and grommeted, with slim guy-ropes as shoulder straps. They werent exactly tents, but some of them had that feeling about them. Maybe for a woman whod secretly rather spend her summer nights under the stars?$$Tatiana Maslany, the Canadian star of Orphan Black, wore an ivory Le Smoking by Bouchra Jarrar to the Emmys last month. Admittedly, there wasnt much in the way of competition, but she was easily among the chicest women at the ceremony, elegant where other actresses looked try-hard or just plain wrong. Its nice to see Hollywood waking up to Jarrars red carpet potential; shes putting a new emphasis on dress-up clothes at her couture shows. For ready-to-wear, presented in her premier arrondissement atelier, which is becoming increasingly crowded as the seasons progress, shes focused on a more everyday kind of elegance.  In a first for Jarrar, there was a tailored pantsuit in a dark-rinse denim, the softness of which defied expectations. Softness was truly the order of the day, be it a caramel-color shrunken leather blouson and matching skirt with an arching slit or a navy viscose trench with a high storm flap and epaulets. But Jarrar was equally concerned with the collections graphic punch, juxtaposing the high-contrast animal print of an elongated gilet with the black lace of a long-sleeved top, or piecing together a sexy asymmetrical tank top with patent shoulder straps from diagonal slices of tech fabric and leather. We cant help circling back around to her smoking jackets though. Does anyone anywhere cut one better?$$For a first-time designer, Brandon Maxwell knows what hes doing. With the uptown location of Mr. Chow as his show venue and a guest list so edited, every name read as a Who's Who of the fashion world, Maxwell had the odds stacked in his favor at his premiere New York Fashion Week presentation. That says nothing of the fact that he joins the design community as Lady Gagas longtime stylist who has covered magazines arm in arm with the singer and who calls Gaga's frequent collaborators Steven Klein, Alexander Wang, and Inez and Vinoodh his friends. Then there was Gaga herself, perched front row in one of his designs, cheering on models as they walked by and breaking into tears of joy as the finale gowns brushed passed her. In a season where designers are striving for intimate, personal settings, Maxwell truly nailed it.  But what of the clothes? With power women as his starting point, Maxwell sent out sharply tailored separates in black, ivory, and a dusty rose, culminating in several over-the-top gowns. Nearly every look featured some element of ridged pleating, a motif derived from Maxwells childhood practice of dressing up his sisters in bed sheets and fastening them with his fathers cummerbunds. The effect worked best when it was used minimally, like on the lapels of second-skin dinner jackets or around the waist of tailored trousers. A high-neck white wrap dress and black, billowy-sleeved frock edged into costume territory, the sort of things that could only be pulled off by someone with a commanding presence to rival Gagas. For those looking for just a touch of diva, wed recommend the cut-to-there minidress on Ophelie Guillermand. Sexy without question, but a little better suited for off-stage activities.$$Brock Collection is still a relatively young label, but husband-and-wife duo Kris Brock and Laura Vassar have already established their signatures. Theyre proponents of an unfussy femininity thats rooted in luxe fabrics and simple silhouettes. Brocade in particular is a Brock staple; its appeared in every collection thus far, from midi-length skirts to billowing, floor-grazing shirtdresses. For Spring, the textures were even more opulentsee the hand-embroidered cotton dresses and ivory python pencil skirt. Those items took elevated daywear to an entirely new place. Brock and Vassars point of view is more about subtle flourishes than specific themes, but they did cite architecture as an influence. We designed the collection while we were living at my parents house, which my mom designed, Vassar explained at their peaceful High Line Room presentation. Its all Gustavian and Swedish style, so its really simple and beautiful with clean lines. So we were thinking a lot about restraintI think its harder to restrain yourself than it is to go overboard. Where they could have added more structure or embellishment to their garments, they held back. One of the best examples of this philosophy was actually made up of two classics: a striped shirt that extended to the floor (and could also be worn as a dress) layered over cropped jeans. Mixing in those casual, humble textures is another Brock signature, ensuring the clothes feel special, but not precious. These were luxurious pieces meant to be worn in your real life, a point that was highlighted by the models footwear: Each look was paired with flat python sandals, a new category for the designers. Heres hoping Brock bags are next.$$The charm of irregularity is how Brunello Cucinelli described the spirit of his Spring collection, a lineup of fluid shapes in creamy whites where raw textures took center stage. Inspired by the elegant beach resorts of the Annes Folles, and the sophisticated yet dgag style of the decadent elites of that era who holidayed in Deauville and Biarritz, the style was relaxed and soft with a subtle retro feel. A touch of modernity was added through references to the Japanese love of organic materialstheir traditional streamlined, minimal lines and sophisticated cutting techniques. Embracing imperfections is a fascinating concept, because it mirrors nature and the flow of life itself, said a dapper Cucinelli, pointing out sweaters knitted with raw hemp, dusters cut from buttery-soft raw silk, and cardigans in corrugated yet supersoft yarns. Pants were the foundation of the collection, which, despite the exotic visual inspiration, was rooted in practicality and wearable day looks. Ankle-grazing culottes were gathered and softly pleated at the waist; a wraparound skirttrouser hybrid looked modern. Paired with a pearl gray shaved mink sleeveless top, it added a touch of luxe to the lineup. Jackets were elongated and masculine with a relaxed feel, due to the use of ultra-lightweight fabrics. Garonne-style cardigans recalled the sophisticated insouciance and the sporty elegance of the 20s, but were given the signature Cucinelli treatment: Crafted with raw, precious fibers, they were deconstructed to achieve a sort of chubby yet fluid effect. Id like my style to be extremely versatile, day-to-night, ageless, timeless, perfect for women of all ages and sizes, he enthused. Case in point: His elegant wife and their two young daughters were on handand all looking at ease clad in head-to-toe Cucinelli.$$Burberry's heritage might be centuries old, but Christopher Baileys vision for the brand is relentlessly forward-thinking. Twenty-four hours before the lights went up on the Burberry Prorsum runway, a sneak peek of the collection was staged on Snapchat. Having recently announced a partnership with Apple Music, it seems the CEO and chief creative is forging ahead with other tech and sound alliances too, and attendees of todays show were treated to a mini concert by Alison Moyet, a video of which will be launched exclusively with the music-sharing service. Performing with a 32-piece orchestra, Moyets ethereal vocals set the darkly romantic tone of the show, and the first model was dressed in head-to-toe blacka thigh-grazing lace minidress, classic trenchcoat, sporty rubber-soled sandals, and a nylon backpack. That mishmash of techy sportswear and delicate vintage-inspired eveningwear was cut with militaristic details throughout: Peacoats came studded with brass, Sgt. Pepperstyle regimental buttons, and slinky satin silk skirts were finished with metallic cording of the kind you might find on a soldiers uniform. In fact, they were made by the same embroiderers that decorate the coats of the Queens Guard, just a stones throw away at Kensington Palace. Clearly homegrown production values are still on the agenda, and much of the lace was made in the U.K., too. Bailey never fails to keep the bigger picture in mind, though, and he explained backstage after the show that, for him, the idea of traditional seasons has essentially become obsolete: Showing those pretty 40s-inspired slips with a cozy, sheared mink coat as well as light summer trenchcoats makes sense in a global market.  And speaking of slip dressinga trend that has been inescapable on both sides of the pondKate Moss, the woman who took the look to the world stage in the 90s, was sitting in the front row next to Londons current reigning cool girl Cara Delevingne. With a social media following in the millions, the model turned actress has an enormous sphere of influence. The counterintuitive styling of the show, where a hoodie and a bias-cut silk dress can happily coexist in the space of one look, had modern verve and spoke to the kind of #OOTDs that live in her Instagram feed. After the Internet frenzy for Burberrys Fall 2015 monogrammed blanket, the brands new nylon backpack, which was embroidered with Delevingnes initials and sat in her lap today, is likely to go viral just as quickly.$$For several seasons, a visit to the Cacharel showroom has been prefaced with the same party line about rediscovering the brand heritage and modernizing it for today. And its tough to take umbrage with clothes that are intentioned, unchallenging, and, more often than not, patterned in flowers. Aside from a venue change to new, well-appointed headquarters on the Left Bank, not much has changed. Which is not necessarily a criticism. The lookbook, shot by millennial photographer Alexandra Sophie, refers to the Cacharel style as Lady 2.0, a catchall that neatly encompasses the signature drop-waist dresses, lace polo tops, and a novelty trench printed with pastel canaries. Indeed, the design studio continues to propose a variety of stylized florals (this time, anemones, poppies, peonies, and a vintage botanical print) alongside everyday overcoats, breezy blouses, and respectable skirts, all corresponding in proportion and palette. One update: Cacharel collaborated with Notify jeans, and the boyfriend styles offset the range of romantic blouses, from embroidered mousseline to broderie anglaise. Oh, and another: A stand-alone store in the French capital is scheduled to open sometime next year. By then perhaps we will see a bit more originality in a way that generates excitement for a deserving brand. The new office is a stones throw from the Muse dOrsay, home to some of the most beautiful flower paintings ever created. Just a thought.$$Calvin Klein designed an era-defining collection of slip dresses for Spring 1994. The models in that showKate Moss, Bridget Hall, Michele Hickswent on to rule the runways for a decade, and the dress became a house icon. The only piece of clothing Klein might be more famous for is his instantly recognizable logo briefs. Twenty-odd years later, perhaps thanks to Internet-fueled nostalgia, or maybe greater cultural forces, contemporary designers are looking back at those early 90s days. Those skimpy silk frocks were all over the New York shows this week, including at Francisco Costas excellent offering for Calvin Klein Collection today.  Costa is well-versed in the labels heritage, but the new Calvin Klein Collection slip dresses are different from the ones of old. Call it grunge deconstruction: Theyre slack at the bust, extra straps dangle every which way, and knit versions stitched with brass chains fray and disintegrate towards the hem. Costa imagined the morning after a liaison, when a woman might toss her lovers tailored jacket and too-big pants over her lingerie, and the tailoring, too, got the deconstruction treatment. Pant hems unraveled, jacket hems were partially sliced away, and sleeves extended almost to the fingertips or were sliced up the seam halfway to the elbows. It was new to see Costa embrace the disarray; in the past hes erred on the side of orderly.  The collections biggest surprise was the photo prints of flowers that appeared on dresses, pants, and a trench alike. Costa doesnt usually show that much pattern on his runway. Its rarer still for it to have such sweet connotations. Heres hoping he indulges his romantic impulses again sometime soon.$$Camilla Freeman-Topper and Marc Freeman shot the lookbook for their new collection inside Frank Gehrys recently opened paper bag building in Sydney, a new wing of the citys University of Technology. The buildings swirling metallic interior wasnt the inspiration for the siblings new clothes, but it may as well have been: This outing was all about curvilinearity, refraction, and controlled swoops of volume. The volume story came through with greatest force in this collections trumpet-shaped sleeves and skirt hems. High-necked tunics and densely knit off-the-shoulder tops with bell-like silhouettes echoed the theme, and numbered among this outings standout pieces. This was a notably restrained and sophisticated effort for Camilla and Marcthe froth was curtailed to diaphanous silk and velvet burnout dresses that were understated enough to sit nicely with the collections classically glam draped silk satin looks for evening. The flourishes likewise erred toward a high tonesome decorous eyelash fringe, a touch of metallic. The sprightliest looks here were the ones that featured holographic polka dots woven into lightweight black jacquard. The other graphic pop here came from Camilla and Marcs abstract print, which picked up on the waves built into the collections drapes and flares. The print was attractive and eye-catching, but what stuck with you about this collection were the subtler effects, in particular the ways that Freeman and Freeman-Topper incorporated a sense of openness and fluidity into their generally attenuated silhouettes. The line was long and lean but not constricted. Lots of women will appreciate that.$$The Frick Collection has never opened its doors for a fashion show. Over the years, many designers have asked, but the answer was always no. This season Carolina Herrera heard yes. The skylit atrium is a transporting place; its Beaux Arts grandeur might have tempted Herrera to look back in time for inspiration, but shes a resolutely modern-minded designer. She has been quick to embrace high-tech materials and figure out ways to incorporate them into her tony, uptown aesthetic. This season, more than ever, she put them to work.  On a preshow tour through her backstage dressing area, the buzzword was pleats, but not old-fashioned pleats. Herreras are trompe loeil, narrow bands of tech fabric stitched onto transparent mesh of different densities. Sometimes the tulle disappeared on the skinand sheer paneling has never looked more decorous or discreet. On other pieces, it was thicker, almost like athletic mesh, creating a sporty mien. The second talking point was pink. Im in my rose period, Herrera said. From a flirty day dress (real pleats, not trompe loeil) in a delicate shade of blush to an embroidered shift in raspberry suede, there was no shortage of the shade, and it did a good job of warming up the somewhat clinical feel of the synthetic materials. For those not predisposed to pink, there were a few other frocks in black and white and a nice-looking, vaguely New Look suit in midnight blue flocked velvet. Herrera was eager to avoid prints because shes done them so often in the past. Like we said, resolutely modern-minded. Still, that rose-print slip dress was awfully pretty.$$Alexis Martial and Adrien Caillaudaud took the ultra-gamine Carven girl on a deep-sea dive for their Spring 2016 collection, exercising their ability to produce neat tailoring, sporty details, and the type of kicky, youthful A-line silhouettes that consistently bring the ingenues running, credit cards extended. The story, said Martial and Caillaudaud backstagewhile standing before an inspiration board posted with Corinne Days portraits of Kate Moss for The Face, early female scuba divers, and assorted oceanic creatureswas of a girl in search of a seaside adventure. She ditches her boyfriend (but packs some of his shirts to wear with her minis) and learns to scuba dive. Eventually, as the looks lead into evening, she goes back to the city; only now shes wearing her souvenirs.  And true to the narrative, nautical touches on suiting and separates (eyelets as portholes!) gave way to transparent logo tees paired with a Grey Gardensesque shirt-as-skirt (Because youre on the boat and you really dont care, said Caillaudaud) and, eventually, a long and lean silhouette, often centered around a narrow crepe pant anchored by a clunky sandal. But while prints were derived from sea creatures (jellyfish, octopuses, striped puffer fish, all covered in fluorescent spots and striations) and one stiff frocks frilled edges were reminiscent of undulating tentacles, most of the clothesbarring at least one excellent knit, which boasted dangling, beaded fringelacked the movement inherent to the life aquatic, favoring instead the rigid thickness of decidedly un-casual clothes. Adventure, after all, is about freedomand even ingenues need some wiggle room.$$For his Spring 2016 collection, Cdric Charlier was driven to abstractionspecifically to the work of Victor Pasmore, who is credited with pioneering abstract art in Britain in the first half of the 20th century. Pasmore was a painter and an architect, too, but there was none of that kind of sculptural quality to Charliers designs, which, in most cases, were worn away from the body, hanging straight down from the shoulders or cinched at the waist by thick obi-style belts, which also hung loose off the backs of some dresses, trailing behind the models as they walked.  Silhouette was clearly foremost in the designers mind. I was really interested in this T shape, Charlier explained backstage before the show, tracing the trunk and shoulders of one of the model images on his run of show, and it showed: The shoulders were the strongest point on a majority of looks, with skirts typically ending in a loose ruffle and trousers in a frayed hem. The palette was predominantly neutral, in shades of blush, pink, and peach, occasionally dipping into hunter green, and the fabrics were mostly natural fibersas Charlier said, he wanted to stay with cotton and silk for as much of the collection as possible. It was all designed for day, from the boxy shirtdresses with plenty of hanger appeal to the military-style anoraks done in waxed cotton and cotton jacquard. Most winning were the mixed-print patchwork dresses, which felt hard and soft all at once, with all of the grace of Pasmores own Roses in a Jaronly this version you can wear to your next garden party.$$Its about taking her out of urban life and putting her feet on the sand. Its where I long to be, more and more, said Phoebe Philo in her debrief about Cline, as dozens of journalists jostled to shove their iPhones in her face. But the background of Clineits conceptual tented setting, its variety, the storming briskness of her modelscannot be captured in a convenient old-school sound bite about color, silhouette, and theme. Philo rebuilt Cline by trusting her instincts, and by trusting that other women are tuned into the same wavelength. And now shes getting more outspoken about it. I am somebody who is interested in how clothes make us feel, she said, and in how we behave in different places. I thought, If you were traveling for a year, what would you need to take with you? Where were her model-avatars heading? The space, constructed by FOS, a Danish installation artist, suggested something between a festival hangout and an art biennial in a hot locale, but the music was a mechanistic drumming that kept pace with the stream of girls, marching swiftly and with intent, shod in utilitarian ankle boots, or almost-medieval woven-leather pointy flats.   If anything has turned a corner at Cline since the last couple of shows, its the feeling that an incipient conceptualism and eccentricity has been jettisoned. Instead, this was a grounded collection, a sophisticates compendium, giving the definitive word on wearing the 90s slip dress in pulled-together grown-up style; on handling the 80s tendency with a curvy shoulder line and a Jean Paul Gaultier rib-knit waist; on nodding to the milkmaid neckline with an abstracted trompe loeil corseting; and on pants, pants, pants. What with the English menswear tweedy checked suiting, the wide cropped pair of trousers in extraordinarily high-shine black satin and, then, the olive green army parka and pants that swing out at the end, Philo reminded all and sundry that this is the house that services women with the best cuts available. Yet on the other hand, Cline is also a dress source. And here, there was a full spectrum of those as well, not just plunging lace-edged slips but practical workday survival looks in utititarian linen, and then, for evening or perhaps day-wafting on holiday, long fluid jersey dresses with high-waisted bodices and chaste-medieval scooped necks. A telling reaction to this collection was the instant straw poll going on among guests as they poured out of the show. Asking each other what they liked best, everyone had a different answer. And thats the way it is, today: There is, and should be, no one look, but a spectrum of equally valid looks for many of us to feel like ourselves in. Phoebe Philos genius is that she holds the mirror up to that emotional reality. Applause.$$Does a vulnerable woman have to be weak? Chris Gelinas posed that question today and, with his Spring collection, offered up the answer as he saw it: certainly not. Taking as his central motif a graphic spin on one of Irving Penns famous flowersa punchy version of a typically fragile thingGelinas toyed with different takes on the idea of controlled exposure. His opening look, a barely there white tank and hot pants, came topped with a hardy coat in a menswear-inspired plaid. Elsewhere, languid dresses came with curving seams that buttoned (or unbuttoned) all the way up. Gelinas noted that while his clientele of a certain age would wear them the traditional way, his more directional young shopper could well opt to undo them, throw on a pair of shorts, and let the dresses sides fly free.  The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist had some real hits on his hands with pieces like a printed blouse with slashed full sleeves (shown with another pair of hot pants), and his fabrications remain among the strongest of New York Citys young guns. While impeccable textiles and techniques arent always fully appreciable on the runway, Gelinass guests milled around post-show, admiring the Italian blossom-print fils coup jacquard, shorn and married to an underlayer of black organza, and the dense, all-over embroidery that gave a certain toughness to his flounced miniskirt. The designer showed a similar skirt for Fall 2015, but still, this collection felt a far cry from that seasons nicely austere homage to American workwear. Here there was a certain, albeit very modern, primness; you felt it in the buttoned-up shirts; whittled, cropped pant legs; and circle skirts. At times, perhaps, it was a bit more controlled than vulnerable; you wanted to see Gelinass muse come just a bit more undone. These clothes had a beautiful womanliness to them, though. Gelinass wholesale business is a relatively new one (he has a loyal base of private customers, and now stockists that include Fivestory New York, Shopbop.com, and L.A.s Guerilla Atelier): You got the sense its only going to grow in the months to come.$$Im a very curious person, said Hussein Chalayan backstage. Hes right about that, in both senses. For only an inquiring mindand a very particular attitudecould have formulated the fabulous coup de thtre at the heart of this mornings Chalayan presentation. Upon entering the show space, two models could be seen wearing white paper dresses with military detailing, standing in some kind of glassless vitrine. The audience checked them out, then blanked them out: They werent doing much, just standing there. The show proceeded. As soon as the first bespoke cigar-holder pocket at the chest of an olive green military-style skirt-dress appeared, it became apparent this was an extension of Chalayans most recent Cuban-themed menswear collection. And, indeed, there were some looks from that outing sprinkled among the pliss skirts that were printed with abstracted pie charts from the CIA Factbook on Cuba, the cute Plonk cartoon character Chalayan found in the British Library and transported to his muse nation, and the neutral-toned dancer-and-trumpeter brocade. For some reason the soundtrack was a medley of a woman moaning in suggestive ecstasy and the Knight Rider theme song: unlikely bedfellows. The clothes were precise and complicated and sometimes very beautiful. Each model wore rope-tied shoes whose heel was an on-its-side cylinderone of these heels detached early in the show and rolled forlornly to a halt as its wearer walked on. Then came the splash. Those two paper-dress-wearing models tensed. Two hidden showerheads above them suddenly gushed forth. Andwhoa!the paper dresses literally melted away as the water doused them, revealing crystal-flashed, palm-pattern party dresses beneath. It was amazing to watch. The models, one of them shivering, walked the runway and left a slick of water behind them. Afterward, the very curious Mr. Chalayan explained the sleight of dress thusly: That was to represent the transformation of a militant kind of situation [in Cuba] to a more playful one. I liked the idea of using water. Because, of course, Cuba, theres a sea. So I thought how could I fuse these ideas together. And I liked the idea of a garment that could melt and reveal something else underneath. And it was, of course, crystal embellished because our sponsor was Swarovski. So we had these dancing palm trees, and the crystals were their coconuts. It was a real challenge, to be honest. A lot of back and forth. Girls slipping, as you saw, and heels breaking, but who cares? I like taking risks. Original, curious, and intelligent, Chalayan is a designer to cherish.$$See Chanel and fly? As much as the foreign members of the audience might wish, thats not quite the case, since there are still 24 Paris hours to go till the Spring shows are over. Still, women of all nations were amused to check in ahead of time at the Chanel airport terminal Karl Lagerfeld installed in the Grand Palais. It provided a funny enhanced-reality replica of a situation we all know only too well: the one where we watch everyone else milling around, busy on their ways with their rolling suitcases, their tracksuits, and contra-freeze in-flight comfort sweaters, their practical flats for walking the endless corridors to baggage claim, and the crucial sunglasses for the jet-lagged arrival. Only, of course, all this is considerably upgraded: Its the idea of how it should look! quipped Lagerfeld. It is strange to see Chanel taking over the flight controls the day after a dispute between Air France and its workers came to an ugly head over falling business and layoffs. Instead, here was Chanel putting the best and most globally appreciated face of France forward, and laying out an array of products that will most certainly fly off the racks at duty-free and in all cities where the house has boutiques. Chanel has been most careful to clock up its air miles in customer-care outreach in the past couple of years: The destinations indicated on the Grand Palais departure boardSingapore, Dubai, Seoul, Tokyoare all cities where Lagerfeld and co. have taken the double-C traveling show to first-class customers. And what will this well-traveled international clientele be taking onboard from this particular show? Bits and pieces from all over the concourse, no doubta Chanel range that runs from the witty and kitsch (Chanel hard-case wheelie carry-on bags, Teva-type sandals with tweed straps and flashing runway-landing lights running around the soles), takes off in the ironic, insider trophy (70s leisure jackets, plane-patterned tricolor intarsia cashmere sweaters, and a flash of Laura Ashleyesque puff-sleeved denim), and then lands amid sparkling splendor. The twinkling herringbone jackets and shell tops, paved in crystal and decorated with fat, black ribbon bows, are quintessentially, timelessly Chanel, nothing to do with noveltyyet also, in their way, an accessory rather than an outfit. In the congested skies of fashion, Captain Karl is one person who knows how to navigate Chanel in all the right directions.$$The 1990s is one of Springs big stories, but no one has put forward her interest in the decade more explicitly than Clare Waight Keller at Chlo. On every seat, there was a printed note: This seasons collection is a tribute to girls named Kate, Chlo, Cecilia, Corinne, Rosemary, Emma, and Courtney, who embody the liberty and the elegance of a perfectly mastered and excessively lived simplicity. Backstage, the designer explained she grew up alongside that motley crew of models, photographers, and superstar performers. For Waight Keller, they represent a freer time: Theres such a fast pace to fashion now; I think weve lost the innocence of the spirit of fashion, the youthful optimism that it portrays. And I think theres something quite joyful about fashion thats been missing.  In keeping with that sentiment, she imbued the new collection with a playful spirit, quite literally in the case of the rave-girl tracksuit separates she started with. Athleisure is something different for Chlo, and it was most convincing when Waight Keller combined a split-hem track pant with a romantic, off-the-shoulder shirt typical of the brand. As the show progressed, it took on more of those familiar Chlo tropesfestival dresses, peasant tops, lacy little bandeaux and miniskirtsbut never lost its 90s leanings. The denim separates were oversize and frayed. Overallsin trouser and dress formconjured images of raves gone by, too. There were even Hammer (as in MC) pants. All of which will likely play exceedingly well with young women who missed out on them the first time around.  Waight Keller had Georgina Grenville, Cecilia Chancellor, and Angela Lindvall representing the 90s in the front row, but what a kick it wouldve been to see them on the runway in these clothes. Youthful optimism is wasted on the young.$$There were mountains of delphiniums shipped in to decorate the Dior tent and mountains of people clogging the Rue de Rivoli entrance, jostling for a glimpse of Rihanna. Inside, though? There was Raf Simons backstage, talking about keeping things simple and quiet: Its a calm one, and very softaway from the overdone. I didnt want to embellish. So I was thinking about the South of Francerainbows and the simple things. And theres a bit of Victoriana: something of that film Picnic at Hanging Rock. With a slight sexual undertone of darkness. Simons can lay reasonable claim to have been the one to start both the current Victoriana-nightdress trend and the intergalactic astronaut trends that are running through so many collections this seasonhe proposed both themes in his Spring 2015 ready-to-wear show. But part of the responsibility for helming a behemoth brand like Christian Dior is filling stores with daywear for women who like feminine things rather than conceptual clothes, and this season he attended to servicing it.  His solution was to pair scallop-edged handkerchief cotton dresses, little shorts, and bodices with black tailoring. The jacketssoftened from the corseted New Look hourglassskimmed the body and broke into bands of micro pleats at the hem, a masculine-feminine merge suggesting the techniques that went into the trains of Victorian and Edwardian dresses. The sexual undertone? Not so much in the clothes as at the necks, which were bound with tight scarves and chokers, each carrying a single jewel and dangling a metal tag, some of which read 1947, the date of Diors revolutionary New Look collection. In terms of fashion, though, there was nothing very disturbing or challenging in any of this. Deliberately so: In a season where many collections have apparently neglected to remember that there might be warm weather in 2016, Dior is one place where fresh summer options will be found.$$The North African playground of Morocco is oft-mined territory for fashion designers: Its exotic textiles and rich cultural landscape stole the heart of Yves Saint Laurent, and Alber Elbaz paid homage to the ancient land (also his birthplace) for Lanvins sumptuous Fall 2015 show. But fast-forward a generation or two to New York Citybased designer Christian Siriano, whose Spring 2016 show mapped a fantasy road trip taking in Casablanca, Marrakech, Tangier, and Fez through his glamorous West Coast lens. It was about the dream of Morocco. I researched traditional interiors and architecture, including many different mosques, said Siriano. He stripped back the vibrant palette of the Berbers in favor of optic white, blush, and sandy-toned silks cut into his signature structured shifts and a slew of floaty tunics matched with pencil skirts or fluid palazzo pants. Amid the flounce of handkerchief hems and cocktail dresses in body-con knit, Siriano applied an intricate textural play of pom-poms, fringing, and a geometric tiled jacquard that reflected his inspiration with a somewhat heavy hand. Later on, he tipped the scales in his favor when translating those tropes into the more familiar territory of eveningwear, where pleated goddess gowns and a frothy tulle pinafore injected a welcome lightness. It is from those looks that Sirianos front row fixtures Christina Hendricks and Orange Is the New Black star Laura Prepon might choose their next red carpet moment: a marabou-flecked ball skirt perhaps, or one of the gowns encrusted in scalloped peach sequins. Despite their couture touch, even those showstoppers paled in comparison to four finale looks that emerged with satin trains in eye-watering pastel silksthose were the welcome color shock this collection needed from the get-go.$$I wanted something very airy, very light, very easyand quite minimal as well, said Christian Wijnants at his presentation today. Well, consider that job done. But . . . hold on . . . presentation? Wijnants has stepped off the runway. He said this was a result of the opening of his first flagship store, in Antwerp, a project that has been dominating his time. Hmm. Hmmmmm. Well, whatever the reason, the absence of a runway proved no greatly significant obstruction to the delivery of this collection. Wijnants said he had been thinking about Brancusi, and there was some correlation to that evident in the irregular lumpen-ness, hinting at distorted symmetry, in his fil coupe applications. More broadly though, this was an efficient but not especially uplifting compilation of contemporary fashion tropes. The strongest pieces included a tightly fringed kicky jumpsuit, and a blouse fronted with frayed panels of clothes that transformed the canvas pants obscured beneath them into the viable foundation of an evening look. Fil coupe suiting printed with a tonal monkey relief motif, frayed panel cotton viscose knit tees, some linen-lined scuba-foam hot pants, and fringing galore on denim-chambray separates were all fine and dandy. It was interesting, though, how the transplantation of this collection from runway to showroom rather sucked the oomph out of it. This collection was full of solidly tasteful left-field pieces, but there was not a great deal to get properly excited about here.$$Last season, she discovered sex said Christopher Kane. Now shes crazy in love! Kanes work is always about who he is, where he comes from, and what hes experiencing at the time. And some of the creative connections he makes are through language. The word crazy is the one with the emotional double meaning which set him off this time. Our life has been a bit of a car-crash recently, he remarked, in a preview at his studio. He did not spell out why that is, but he and his family have been dealing with the recent loss of their mother and of Christophers mentor in the past year or so. Thus the imagery of car-wrecks, fractured shapes, jagged cutouts, and spray-painting filtered into his dresses and tailoring. Perhaps it was his raw state of mind that led him to look at the instinctive, unfiltered nature of outsider art, a train of thought that led him to apply naive hand-stitched motifs to sweaters and leather coats, and to apply frayed white chiffon frills to collars and pockets. Another sideways leap made Kane think about mental institutions and medical science, hence the woman in the blue shirt, banded with wipe-clean plastic cuffs and a strict skirt: Like a nurse whos going to give you a lethal injection! Belaboring explanations is never the way to understand Christopher Kane, though. Getting him is always a case of whether you appreciate his electric fusion of weirdness and chic. There were jolts of that sort of current running through the detailsnarrow plastic restraint tags on black silk dresses, worn as chokers and decorating bags; a reprise of Kanes signature neon lace in even sicker combinations of orange, yellow, and lime; and funny envelope clutches cut in the shape of cartoon explosions. Fun, odd and elegant by turns, this was a show which covered a lot of bases. No matter what life has been throwing at him, it proved that Christopher Kane is a solid designer.$$Ladies, heres a dating tip: Go out with guys like Christopher Raeburn. This is an analysis based entirely on Raeburns design ethos, but it doubles as a pretty good laundry list of things to look for in a man. 1) Raeburn has integrity, as demonstrated in his commitment to utilizing upcycled and locally sourced materials and vegetable dyes like the ones used in the silk floral prints in his latest collection. 2) Raeburn is a true team player, on the evidence of the two collaborations he unveiled this seasonchunky sandals made with Clarks, and knits produced with the house Knyttan. 3) Hes romantic yet practical: Note the standout accessory at Raeburns show this afternoon, a hand-tied jacquard fanny pack. Nuff said. Really, though, the main reason to go out with a guy like Christopher Raeburn is that Christopher Raeburn is as excited about the things a woman does as the way a woman looks. Purely on the level of aesthetics, this was by far Raeburns most compelling womenswear showhe finally got a firm handle on feminine cuts and codes. But Raeburn arrived at that breakthrough courtesy of his theme, an homage to intrepid female explorers that summoned both a pioneer spirit and a sense of authority. For all the sheer diaphanousness of a dress in patchworked olive drab parachute silk, for instance, the look still communicated vigor and potency. Seriously, date a guy who understands that softness and strength are not opposing values. Raeburn evinced that understanding again and again in these clothes. There was a certain tenderness to his basket-weave fil coupes, made from strips of old air-break parachute fabric and either overdyed black or left plain. But Raeburn used the textile in silhouettes that were matter of fact, like a wrapped tunic and long skirt, or a pair of low-slung, wide-leg trousers. Elsewhere, transparent materials or his vegetable-dyed floral print introduced that tender note. Other looks had a harder, more graphic edge, in particular the printed gray jersey and olive drab cotton pieces, but he muted the blunt effect by hewing to shapes that, though tailored, were relaxed. Raeburn has suddenly become very good at mixing his tones, and creating garments that feel multidimensional. His clothes were distinctive, but not defining. A woman wearing them could feel utterly herself and confident about lighting out for new territory. Date a guy like Christopher Raeburn. Or you know what? If youd rather, feel free to go it alone.$$The humble weed is finally getting its moment in the spotlight. Inspired by their ability to survive in urban environments against all odds, Rozae Nichols turned her Spring collection into what she called a celebration of the mightiness of these hard-to-kill plants and their knack for breaking their way through cracks in cement. Nichols, whose brand launched in 2011, quickly found success with her digital floral prints, which have been stamped on a growing list of categories that now includes shoes and swimwear. But this season the designer seemed to want to branch out in a new direction. Her best pieceslike a color-blocked cami dress or topwerent printed at all but embellished with hand-stitched laser-cut flowers, part of Nicholss aim to push her signature florals into the third dimension. The palettesalmon pink with lavender, dusty rose with brown, navy with golden yellowlent everything a delightful jolie laide vibe. Nichols has also been training her customer to seek solids from the label; the cropped, colorful flares will certainly further her efforts.$$Co is a brand based in Los Angeles. Until now, though, the collections that Co honchos Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern produced havent been particularly suggestive of the placetheres always been an idiomatically Californian sense of ease to Cos clothes, but its been overshadowed by a tone of Old World soign. (And sometimes a certain cloudy-weather moodiness, too.) This season, however, Kern and Danan took inspiration from their surroundings, lightening up their collection both literally and tonally, and tipping their hat to the local landscape with palm-frond motifs and fabrics that conjured a distant ocean view. What Cos new materials lacked in weight they made up for in richness: The lavish materials included a palm-patterned mesh jacquard, a wave-textured 3-D-printed viscose, and, most gorgeous of all, a white chiffon flecked with devor velvet. A keyhole-collared maxi dress in the fabric was one of the collections understated standouts. Elsewhere, there were simple button-down blouses with high-drama collars, tailored frocks with bouffant skirts, handknit cotton sweaters, and a bevy of A-line and Peter Pancollared looks that referenced high-end mod. The big sellers, though, will be Cos expanded range of denim done in collaboration with Franois Girbaud: As well as introducing new silhouettes in the raw Japanese denim currently flying out of stores, Kern and Danan debuted a version of their best-selling flares in off-white cotton canvas. Emboldened, perhaps, by the Girbaud collaborations success, Co has embarked on two new ones. The terrific hats in the lookbook were done in partnership with milliner Fil, and the sunglasses are Co by Jacques Marie Mage. Altogether, the clothes and accessories made for a very Co take on L.A.: Hollywood glam as reimagined by Truffaut or Fellini, perhaps.$$Stuart Vevers walks to work at Coach along the High Line every day, lucky thing. The aerial park, with its grasses and fig trees and urban butterflies, tracks across the west side of Manhattan as one of the most joyously human examples of industrial repurposing in our times. The new Coach offices are under construction near the end of the High Line at 30th Street, as it happens, and it was adjacent to that location, on a perfectly sunny September afternoon, that the company invited the press, buyers, and celebrities to step along the old railway tracks and into a temporary grass-planted space to see the first big runway show Coach has staged for New York Fashion Week. As it also happens, 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Coach, So, said Vevers, it felt like a good moment to show we have confidence. The values of Coach have always been purely American and pragmatic, a company proud to fulfill everyday needs. But in the 21st century, Vevers is one of those designers who questions how, and whether, that democratic ideal in fashion is reaching young people at attainable prices, and in ways that will excite them. His answer was to think about a magpie girl who goes on road trips, picking up Western things, but also might steal from her grannys closet on the Upper East Side. If so, granny was a bit of a 70s bohemian, because this girls dresses were all made from micro-floral multicolored patchworks, though they were definitely a lot shorter than they were at Woodstock, and with an easily relatable pull-on-and-go attitude about them. Still, Vevers is not someone who will go off on narrative raptures about fictional muses. Refreshingly, hes a down-to-earth product designer who is good at thinking about such things as what a functional cut-down cowboy boot should look like for a customers money: i.e., comfortable, with a lot of collaged fun thrown into the bargain. I dont think Ive ever put a heel on the runway at Coach, he said, laughing. I just want to make it feel light in spirit and bring some joy to it, and maybe a sense of the American outdoors. It worked. Coach is, of course, a great American bag companyand there were plenty of respectfully traditional saddle-leather hobo shapes reprised in the showbut it also needs to convert a new generation to its faith. And, oddly, on the High Line today it felt as if Stuart Vevers, an Englishman abroad, is the person who might be able to see exactly how to do that.$$The cult of Comme is a complicated micro-society shadowed by layers of lines within. Beneath apex-Commeand what a truly incredible collection Rei Kawakubo showed this weekthere is the Comme des Garons commercial collection that never sees the light of runway but that the buyers flock to postshow. Boy, the showroom was rammed today. Below, significantly below, there is Comme Shirt (kinda my favorite in terms of buy-to-wear), Comme Girl, and probably several others hidden away in the Comme-citadel on Place Vendme of which most people have probably never heard. Comme des Commethis collectioninhabits a welcome sweet spot between haute Comme and Girl. It is the go-to uniform for Comme acolytes: These are the clothes of the disciples. Todays collection contained an interesting mlange of the rustic and the historical, shot through with the white-and-navy overtones of seifuku (old-school Japanese school uniform lifted from French sailor suits), that seem so ingrained in the Comme unconscious. The cut-away angle beneath the two buttons on a nylon/polyester jacket (CdGCdG is a master of mustering richness in synthetics) spoke loudly of early19th century military tailoringlook at portraits of Lord Nelson. The rough, gently pleated linen shift and smock dresses whispered of a Thomas Hardy-ish, bucolic vision of the tenant farmers wife. There were even pantaloons, worn over the usual Repetto uwabaki. This was a carefully and poignantly rendered articulation of the ascetic aesthetic of Comme: slow fashion for deep thinkers. Dreamy.$$Rei Kawakubo has cast a spell over her audience. The fashion community strives to keep believing that fashion can touch deeper meanings in this time of often bewildering industrial change, and she's the one people turn to for some kind of emotional stimulus that goes beyond the blunt service of commerce. Once more this season, she again blocked the expectation that she would offer anything recognizable as clothes. Instead she mounted a monumental sculptural meditation on Blue Witches, a coda further explained by her husband Adrian Joffe as Powerful women who are misunderstood, but do good in the world. Was she talking about herself? Comme des Garons, as a retail operation, has grown against all odds as an independent multibrand chain which buys young designers, whom Kawakubo personally approves, and sells their work in branches in Tokyo, New York, and London. They definitely regard her as a woman with magical transformative powers who they hold in awe. In those stores, meanwhile, Kawakubos own conceptual collections reappear in simpler, wearable forms, right down to ranges of T-shirts which indicate her original runway styles in cool ways. Whether or not that qualifies Kawakubo as a literal Witch, it can safely be predicted that the ideas she put forth on her Spring runaway will make their way, in far more accessible forms, to her shops all over the word. That surely gives her the right to go as experimental and extreme as she did this season.$$All around Paris, the Comptoir des Cotonniers ads featuring Charlotte Gainsbourg and her daughter Alice catch the eye without imposing upon it. Fresh into her second season, creative director Anne Valrie Hash said the Fall suiting and new Slash sneaker are outperforming expectations. As for her Spring collection, her enthusiasm radiated through the brands showroom. First, she presented an all-white grouping: a tuxedo-style blazer and trousers, and a slouchier pullover with rolled-cuff pants. Next, she made the case for military-inspired jackets paired with ingenue base layers. Hash seemed especially excited to reveal Comptoirs partnership with J Brand (both are part of Fast Retailings roster) and the resulting denim range. Unsurprisingly, the sneakers will return, this time in denim, gray jersey, and floral-printed leather. She showed how small details such as knits with deep side slits make a big difference in how the clothes can be worn. And once summer arrives, a new cotton-viscose blend dubbed Ma Double Peau (My Second Skin) will solve the summer-weight sweater woes. Dresseslong patchwork white lace with a drawstring waist; a flimsy embroidered and printed slipmarked the seasons apogee. Yet when Hash singled out the well-proportioned overcoats (neither too boxy nor too slim) and the hickory stripe slacks, noting that they could have been worn 10 years ago and could likely be worn 10 years from now, she revealed how smoothly shes integrated the Comptoir spirit with her own. Overall, she seemed well aware that maintaining momentum is as simple as keeping things simple.$$Seventies, 80s, 90s. Any which way you cut it, fashion is in the midst of a vintage moment. Whats a born and bred minimalist to do? Costume National designer Ennio Capasa, to his credit, isnt changing his tune. Hes been around too long for that, a fact he likes to emphasize on his mood board, labeling images from his past with their season and year. For Spring 2016, he doubled down on the tailoring hes long been associated with and streamlined his color palette. Backstage he said he focused on fabric development to create sensuality. Glitter pinstripes, polka-dot fil coupe, and suede laser-cut to look like lace made appearances. A minidress as silvery as tinsel was gathered at one shoulder with a silk ribbon. Still, you couldnt help but feel Capasa preferred the simplicity of basic black or white, which he used more than anything else here, perhaps because it put nothing extraneous in the way of his tailoring. This season his suiting had a somewhat softer, more feminine sensibility than it has in the past. Ruffles cascaded down the front of a vest and metal rings connected the front and back panels on jackets, leaving a suggestive slice of shoulder exposed. Minor developments. A single red pantsuit worn with a sheer red turtleneck underneath made a lasting impression, but otherwise this collection couldve used more spark.$$Does the world need another heritage brand? Probably not. Do women outside of France have any special feeling for Courrges? Unlikely. But any doubts about Sbastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillants efforts to revive Andr Courrgess space-age label were quickly dispelled by their show this morning. The LVMH Prize finalists, who put their fledgling line, Coperni Femme, on hold to focus on this endeavor, made a clever debut. Their trick was to get down to basics. As the pair said when they came out onstage to introduce the collectiona charming performance that was a novelty in and of itselfthe show had no total looks. Instead there were iconic Courrges items tweaked for 2016 shoppers15 in all, and each one available in a range of 15 different materials. That kind of variety will be a boon to retailers, which tend to want items unique to their stores. And it was refreshing to see young designers focused so clearly on commerce, especially in a season when others have been creatively flummoxed by new responsibilities at the historic brands theyve inherited.  The show felt a bit like Courrges 101, what with the steady progression from the houses familiar cropped jacket in a crinkly patent to miniskirts, A-line shifts, and cropped pants in such materials as suede, techno knits, and patchworked leather. The foundation for every piece was a white ribbed knit bodysuit that Meyer and Vaillant could spin out in a dozen directions next season if they choose to.  Courrgess owners, Jacques Bungert and Frdric Torloting, planned this launch just about perfectly. The late 60s and early 70s have been trending on the runways since Nicolas Ghesquire landed at Louis Vuitton. Julien Dossena has done a bang-up job of breathing new life into Paco Rabanne, whose work shares similarities with that of Courrges. Timing counts. The faster this foursome can get these pieces in shops and online, the better.$$Spring found Jade Lai in conversation with Le Corbusier. The Creatures of Comfort designer was looking at the storied mid-century architect and his prolific, elemental legacy. After a stay at his Brutalist Marseille masterwork, the Radiant City, it seems the pair struck up a natural repartee. Lais collection opened with a grouping of graphic prints in jolie laide color combos: The first look was a shirtdress in blocky black, red, white, and pale yellow. It was bold, to be sure. Elsewhere that mood manifested itself even more vividly, as with a sheeny, cherry-red tank dress layered under knit shorts in an equally punchy shade of the same color. Among other standouts were the closing pair of looks, liquid-looking cupro pieces, rawly appliqud with designs inspired by Le Corbusiers drawings. The architect would no doubt have approved of Lais take on off-shouldernot some festival-ready style, gauzy and hanging from the collarbone, but a graphic, straight-across, chicly seductive version. Styled beneath a knit slip dress, it felt in step with the runways recent mood. What was particularly notable about these pieces, though, was their sophisticated brand of commercial appealscarcely anything looked daunting to style. Denim was particularly strong here; Lai had expanded her explorations with the stuff since Resort, and she may well have the ultimate high-rise flare on her hands. Whats more elemental than dreamy blue jeans?$$When does something thats come and gone come back into fashion? Creatures of the Winds Christopher Peters asked backstage before the labels Spring 2016 show, and during a moment when fashion-conscious girls everywhere reach into their closets to pull out everything from 20s tea dresses to orange-tab-bearing Levi's 501s and sleek contemporary suiting, its certainly a worthy question. For Peters and design partner Shane Gabier, it became a way to create a pastiche of all of their favorite things in their latest collection, from cropped motorcycle jackets with seams co-opted from 40s corsetry to bias-cut skirts, 30s slip dresses, and glam rockinspired denim. As it processed by on the runway, it had the not-entirely-unappealing feeling of a yard sale attended by punky young femmes with bouffant hairdos and fishnet tights. This being Creatures of the Wind, the winsome 70s were never far behind, whether spotted in the densely floral-embroidered miniskirts and crocheted vests or the chunky-heeled, hand-painted snakeskin slingbacks that alternated mostly with slip-on sneakers designed in tandem with APL. And while theres certainly something to be said for culling all the best bits from the current trendsfrom a silky wallpaper-patterned cotton jacquard and a wispy silk-cut floral dvor slip of a frock to trouser legs and tunic hems replete with ring-pull zips for ones own adjustmentsthe most winning looks felt truest to Creatures of the Winds own sense of charm: cheeky, trim knits paired with sloping skirts and an army jacket emblazoned with a hammered silver floral motif, the type of treasure that can become both utterly trend-resistant and just the ticket for weathering spring. The designers choice to begin and end the show with a suitthe first in block-print linen, the last in black cotton sateen, worn with a flowing ivory and metallic-striped pleated dress and trousers that ended mid-calf in a thick, wide cuffproved a happy accident: Its where we are, said Peters, pointing at the run of show, and thats where were going.$$As nineties fashion references go, hip-hop gets short shrift. Grunge keeps coming back; so do nods to original Helmut Lang. But the hip-hop aesthetic, which had such a resounding impact on mainstream style, is reinterpreted comparatively rarely on luxury fashion runways. Thats changingsome of the kids who grew up on hip-hop are fully formed designers nowbut still, it was striking to see Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochss homage to the look at their show today. Ochs and Cushnie came at hip-hop via the work of painter Kehinde Wiley, famed for his Baroque-style portraits of black men clad in the everyday garb they wear on the street. Wiley made for an interesting bridge, inasmuch as the reference to his work allowed the designers to play with tropes for which they clearly have a great deal of affectionnote the baggy pants and bandanas, pleasewhile simultaneously giving their collection a sense of hauteur. This was, relative to previous Cushnie et Ochs outings, a very ladylike collection. That tone was evident especially in the color palette, which erred toward Easter-egg pastels, but it was also reflected in the number of rather demure silhouettes. There was skin, to be surebest seen from the back, in the apron-style openings of certain tops and dressesbut the duos signature pencil dresses were not so much body-con, this season, as classically form-fit. There were a lot of feminine grace notes here as well, like the little flutter of a ruffle edging one yellow frock, or a scarf collar on another dress in seafoam green. Other elements, such as black leather and bright gold buttons or zips, introduced a harder edge. Cushnie and Ochs were onto something interesting, using a reference typically perceived as tough to soften up their signature look, and in so doing, elevating it a great deal. They should make a habit of thinking that way.$$Custo Dalmau called his Spring collection Slow, which appeared to be a bit of a misnomer at first, because the head-on collision of prints, colors, and textures felt more like a frenzy. Actually, the collections name is an homage to slow cooking, of all things, which the show notes defined as a culinary movement that rejects the standardization of taste. Dalmau wanted to go against the current, he said, defying the pull of fast fashion and deliberately designing pieces that would require painstaking and time-consuming work. One open-work vest was assembled like a puzzle, from different pieces of fabric that had been cut into geometrical shapes. Backstage one could admire the impressive handiwork, but on the runway it was hard to notice because, between the contrasting car-wash-pleat skirts, color-saturated dresses layered over slinky striped flares, and embroidered patchwork contraptions, there was simply too much going on. The collection would have benefited if Dalmau had subtracted a few ingredients; that way we could have savored the unique taste of each piece.$$Perennially sunny, Cynthia Rowley was feeling especially so today in the airy, white-walled expanse of her new West Village headquarters, for intense planning on multiple fronts had come to fruition. The surf-inspired video showcasing her Spring collection was in the can, as they say; her Rowley Fitness lineloaded with wetsuitshad arrived; her new furniture line was on the way; and a home fragrance was in the works. But most painstaking of all had been the HQ itself. Bought a year ago and exhaustively renovated (It looked like the water-logged insides of the Titanic, quipped the designer), it was also finished, or very nearly so, down to the Instagram-friendly gold door painted on the outside. The space will double as a kind of community center, she said, with yoga classes and everything. But if Rowley seemed exhausted (she didnt), she was only feigning it. She is forever looking and moving forward. Her Spring collection exemplified this willful cheer, with its splashes of sequins in floral patterns, bursts of metallic tinsel trim, tufts of fluttery shredded chiffon, comfy knits, bold twill appliqus, and studs the size of saucers. A colorful, 60s-style worldliness prevailed. Shapes were roomy and breezy think caftans, jumpsuits, A-lines, and mini kimonos, all sashed liberally. Accessories, too, were shiny and happy, in particular, cat-eye sunglasses and a large beaded necklace that looked straight out of a Frida Kahlo self-portrait. Now there was a woman with cheerful resilience.  Rowley is an avid surfer as are her daughters, hence the wave-riding theme of the video, which will debut tonight in an immersive installation that, thanks to drone technology, all but plops the viewer beachside. It was touch-and-go, though. As a storm moved in the day of the shoot, Rowley sprang into action and got the cast and crew out to Montauk earlier than planneda triumph of logistical will, to be sure. What can I say? she chirped. Im a pathological optimist.$$Sure, Daks was born in London, shows in London, and maintains a retail home on Jermyn Streetthe greatest old-school menswear thoroughfare in the world. Those British roots, though, have become a mere backstory for a house that thrives in Asia and most especially in Japan, where its owners are based. Today the brands creative director, Filippo Scuffi, delivered an assured portfolio of conservatively au courant womenswear that avoided the painful Anglophile bombast that has marked some of Dakss most recent shows. The catwalk was plastered in marble-patterned paper and lined with chrome-effect cladding as if to resemble the Art Deco foyer of some grand 1920s hotel. Along it unfolded a collection that played with some tropes of that time. There were flapperish chiffon dresses, marble-print pants, and a pleasant recurring diamond relief Scuffi had sourced from a bolt of wallpaper printed in 1925. Yet this lineup roamed confidently beyond one particular theme. There were some deftly handled plays on trad gents fabrics rebooted as feminine, masculine shirting detailing emphasized on silk blouses, and brogues that were transformed into double-strap high heels. Rust, the key color in Dakss historic check, translated nicely into a slouchy suede patch-pocket skirt, a shirtdress, and scrunchily tactile bombers. A pleat-heavy riff on chiffon dresses and blouses printed with iterations of that wallpaper pattern in teal and purple were well-executed takes on the Royal Tenenbaums-influenced Pucci/Gucci/Prada reappropriation of soft 70s kookiness. Most meh-heavy was a climactic evening section whose various grand gestures of volume or length seemed out of sync, at least to this eye. Backstage, Scuffi pointed out that one recurring printa washed-out botanical X-rayhad been a special request from Asia. And when a designer is thinking so hard about one particular market, it seems churlish to complain that his collection isnt perfect for another.$$The plaintive refrain that rings through Milan every Fashion Week goes thus: Where are all the young designers? Who's got a different voice? So although he's a transfer from Paris, the arrival of Damir Doma is something for locals to relish. He's a jolt of beard-scratchy thoughtfulness in a town whose fashion business is gripped by the sleek; a bit of spiritual underground to offset all the commercial overground. Doma held his first Italian womenswear show in two adjacent garages behind Via Torino, which gave it that most blessed of elements, outdoor space. On a rough-and-ready catwalk of chipped concrete, the designer showed some comely new variations on his severe and monastic metier. Crisp papery cottonin all-white, checks, or darkened navy strafed by stripeswas melded into restrainedly asymmetrical shapes given depth by fold and knot. A loose micro-check overcoat was satisfyingly gathered by a looped closure. The burnt-out opaque jumpsuits were a touch iffyhad the unreconstructed testosterone that courses through Milan dosed DD?but the same fabric incorporated into patched degrad black trousers worked well. A fil coupe of distressed abstract shapes was deeply Doma: palely interesting, austere, moody. It suits this designer to be close to the production of his clothes, and it suits this city to host him.$$Shallow castellations of ruffle encircled floating corsets, apparently boned by silver zippers that were the recurring chorus of this collection. Armor-like of aspect and surely ideal for the encouragement of positive posture, these topped the skinny pants and fluting skirts corralled by David Koma into what he said was a loose meditation on contemporary dance. Folded strips of tulle wound tight around the body on fitted monochrome dresses or hung slacker on a dress of barely pink, neoprene-lined napa with unzippable sections in its organza-lined skirt. Swarovski gridding had the tough ornateness of a samurai breastplate on closing looks that reasserted the ruffle-topped corsetry. A sheer skirt angled away from a matte black leather sports bra to make an incongruously funereal Empire-line dress. Every detail, whether languid ruffles, a mushrooming gather, or a remixed neckline, appeared as intensely wrought and thought out as the most grueling dance routine: And it is this relish that lends Komas work such a powerful signature.$$Is novelty always necessary? There are only subtle changes to be found between David Michaels collections, but thanks to the near-perfection of his louche tailoring, manythis reporter includedare all too happy to see him staying his chosen course of badass basics. The fine finishing, softly rakish fabrics, and general minutiae may be lost in the context of a lookbook, but are impressed upon you straight away on seeing Michaels wares in person (find them, for example, at Totokaelos massive new Soho digs, where they hang alongside the likes of Haider Ackermann). According to Michael's origin story, his grasp of patternmaking and how clothes hang came to him in a dream, and indeed, that innateness seems to translate into the ease of every garment, from staples like slouchy pull-on pants and menswear-inspired toppers, to more out-and-out sensual pieces like Springs hyper-languid jumpsuit. Michael infused his signature shapes with a little witchy glamour, too, thanks to a glossy black jacket that gave major shades of The Hunger.$$One imagines that Josep Fonts mind might be a lovely place to spend some time. Theres an anachronistic quality to the designers brand of demi-couture as he has established it in his three years at the Spanish heritage house Delpozo. His romanticism and unreservedly fairy-tale brand of femininity hearken back to another time, and the designer has a love of dressing women thats palpable.  For Spring, Fonts women were those of Federico Garca Lorcas Gypsy Ballads and Emilie Flge, muse to Gustav Klimt and, in fact, a fashion designer herself who envisioned proto-bohemian styles far ahead of her time. Many a creative director has name-checked Flge in the past, but rather than appearing merely as a vessel for Klimts famous aesthetic, here Font found a grounding force in Flges love of folklore, and the similarly earthy qualities to be found in Lorcas famous book. Font, whose work so often has an almost synthetically confectionary tenor to it, incorporated those craftier elements into his vernacular in rich and compelling ways. Take a stunning hand-crocheted long raffia vest, or that same material brought to life in a massive icy blue belted wrap. Pieces like that served as textural, welcome foils to Fonts most purely extravagant looks. If otherworldly volumes are a signature of his tenure with Delpozo thus far, then the larger-than-life shirtdress in a metallic palm jacquard with tiers of generous ruffles, or a sheer pannier-like miniskirt, surely pushed even Fonts own boundaries (the fabric of the former came to life beautifully and more quietly as a fringed wrap over white trousers). A grouping of polka-dotted pieces early on and a long rounded skirt in graphic orange and blue scrollwork could surely have been cut from the collection, since their sharpness felt so at odds with the ethereal ideas Font proposed elsewhere. A blue and pink moire frock served as an especially vivid testament to Delpozo fantasia at its best, and contrasted nicely with the houses first move into purses, a chicly boxy doctors bag.$$For decades, Dennis Basso has enjoyed a loyal customer base of great dames and society women. But recently the designer has been refocusing his collections to entice a new clientele. The whole look this year, it appeals to a younger woman, said Basso backstage. Its very youthful and vibrant, and its all about the cities south of the borderCaracas, Acapulco, Rio. But it was a subtle, modern Latin flavor Basso was after: The designer was thinking of Selena Gomez (whose song Good For You played on the runway) and Sofa Vergara. This is for the hip, international woman, said Basso. That translated to sultry, playful ensembles that sizzled in marigold, black, and a vivid abstract tropical print, which looked particularly fresh on a peplum top and shorts combination, not unlike something Gomez would wear on the red carpet. In fact, the print was strong enough that it didnt need the embellishments that Basso adorned it with elsewhere. Lace-up necklines and crop tops that wrapped at the waist injected a dose of sex appeal to the designers signature glam dresses and evening separates, as did his take on Spanish lace on body-hugging dresses. I think no matter who she is, every woman wants to have that sex appeal, said the designer.  Basso was mindful not to stray too far from his core customer. Evening coats, boleros, and black-tie-appropriate gowns were all present. A gorgeous caramel croc bolero, styled with a saucy lace camisole and high-waisted briefs, was a standout. It was the kind of investment piece one could imagine Bassos longtime customer purchasingonly to have it promptly co-opted by her daughter.$$If Derek Lam 10 Crosby VP of design Liz Giardina is endorsing fringe, pom-poms, and eyelet this spring, maybe minimalism really is on its way out. The contemporary label tends to be a bit more eclectic than the tony Derek Lam main line, but the surplus of texture and trim in this new collection still felt like a bit of a departure. Giardina started with Andalusiabull-fighting clothes, Moorish architecture, saturated colorand made it palatable for her city-dwelling customer. The Spanish reference was literal in the case of an embellished matador jacket, less so in the clingy ribbed knits with ruffled edges, but all of it was right-now wearable and in keeping with fashions artsy, far-flung mood. Clever twists on classic pieces are the center of the 10 Crosby brand. See: the ankle-length LBD with tiered ruffles, the crisp shirtdress with hidden suspenders, or the patchworked floral slip with dense eyelet trim. A simple knit  dress in vibrant stripes and a ropey texture also managed to be special, yet wearable. Thats the sort of piece that will draw women to the rackeven those who wouldnt normally reach for a leather lace-up jumpsuit, only to slip it on and instantly realize its endless styling potential. Of course, shoppers who are still hesitant to embrace the picador look should take note of the new accessories: raffia wedges, a patchwork hobo, or a fringed bucket bag would add just a hint of flair to any outfit.$$What Happened, Miss Simone?, the Netflix doc about Nina Simones rich but up-and-down life was a starting point for Derek Lam this season. Simone is a classic Lam muse: American, independent, but not afraid to show her feminine side, and fond of both caftans and the occasional pantsuit.  Spring found Lam working the artier, more bohemian side of his typical sportswear story. One or two of his treasured trenches made their way down the runway, lapel-free, buttonless, and as unfussy as usual. And he did a new take on sailor pants, another signature. Elsewhere, though, Lam tried out just-this-side-of-eccentric ideas like cutouts at the hips of a skirt strung together with sneaker laces, or circular swags of fringe placed here and there on a sleeveless sheath. Those looked familiar from other recent runways, and they distracted from simpler, stronger pieces like intarsia knit dresses, slips inset with lace that drifted softly away from the body, and a chic sweater whose big quirk was its bell sleeves. The show ended on a high note, with siren-y gowns that Lam suspended from the neck halter-style to expose a sexy bit of shoulder.$$Devon Halfnight LeFlufy cited nostalgia as the driving force behind his Spring collection, a nod to the youth subcultures and style tribes of his adopted home, Belgium (hes Canadian by birth). Showing mostly mens, his strength, with a sprinkling of womens, the designer spoke of rave symbolism, coded dance, the frisson of youth, meta-awareness, found footage, and the regrettable unoriginality of the Internet era. A documentary-style approach, as in a rave-scene print on intentionally oversized overcoats, felt bold and novel. Also suiting the theme of idealism were LeFlufys fabrics of choice: poplin, faux leather, and a viscose rayon he developed. LeFlufy earned his B.A. and M.A. at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, a premier fashion college associated with the Antwerp Six. Excellent provenance, to be sure, and hes clearly benefitting from its legacy of wild imaginations, chiefly that of Walter Van Beirendonck, a pioneer of menswear with whom he trained. LeFlufys ideas are at once conceptual and energetic, not an easy feat to pull off; nor was getting on the short list for this years LVMH Prize. Itll be interesting to see where, with some tightening, he takes the label.$$In the wake of the 40th anniversary of her iconic wrap dress, Diane von Furstenberg seems keen to keep riffing on her origin story. She called her show Fortvna, after the Roman goddess of luck and the subject of the first painting Von Furstenberg ever bought. She redefines beauty and paints her own destiny, the program notes read. Fortvnas curriculum vitae sounds a bit like DVFs own. The models, for their part, wore their hair in waves with a fresh bloom tucked behind one ear, the way Von Furstenberg did in her younger days. Self-promotion is smart businessthe entrepreneurial Von Furstenberg would be the first to tell you that. And more often than not this walk down memory lane paid off. Perhaps nobody wouldve missed the metallic lam suede if it had stayed in the archives, and the butterfly embroidery that she lifted from the painting erred a touch on the sweet side by the time the third dress emerged in that motif. But the charm of the patchworked floral-print dresses in short and long varieties compensated. Lily Aldridges plunge-front halter number would stop New York City traffic. A shirtwaist style and a long dress crisscrossed below the bust by a skinny belt were more demure, but still fetching.  There were a few brief nods to the 2010s in the form of olive green leather separates and a single pair of work pants, but Von Furstenbergs heart was in her heritage this season. Nearly four decades after Studio 54, the one-shoulder dress hasnt aged a day. It practically radiated here in multiple layers of saffron and pink chiffon.$$According to Andreas Melbostad, the starting point for this seasons Diesel Black Gold collection was the image of a girl wearing her boyfriends button-down shirt as a dress. Thats one of those images that recur frequently in fashion, and whether the trope comes off shopworn or as a durable idea that can continually be renewed depends entirely on the inventiveness of its reinterpretation. Melbostads tack was to take scarf-like squares of cotton shirting-like fabric and pattern them intoslipdressesand skirts with handkerchief hems. The look was repeated in white-and-black geometric broderie anglaise, and with studs, and in leather, and, most appealingly, in blue-striped cotton broadcloth that quoted directly from the original inspiration. The pieces each had a kicky charm, but Melbostad hammered the look home a few too many times, which dulled the collections impact. Of course, Melbostad hadnt forsworn the Diesel Black Gold staples:biker jackets and denim. The brands biker signature was worked into buckle details and sharp-looking dungarees and leather overall dresses. There were also relatively straight-up biker jackets emblazoned with hardware. The jeans, meanwhile, came off best here in versions dark, mannish, and low-slung, but the Diesel Black Gold girl will also like the pairs done in lace or lace-textured white denim. Theyll look pretty sexy matched with her boyfriends button-down shirt.$$When hes applying himself to the craft of his clothes, Dion Lee is the most rigorous of designers. Hes a brilliant technician. But the curious thing about Lee, as his show this morning underscored, is that he often seems incapable of applying the same degree of rigor to his collections overall as he does to their component parts. This is hardly a problem unique to Lee, but its particularly striking in his case, because both his sense of discipline and the scope of his talents are plain to see. Lees latest collection was a strong one, but it needed an edit. The best individual looks in the showthe black-and-navy scuba dresses with perforated flounceswere the ones that interfered most with the story Lee was trying to tell this season. And that was an interesting story: The collections nubby suedes, bias-cut linen gauze, and hues of rust and sand all expressed Lees ambition to introduce an earthy tone to his clothes, while the loose-limbed silhouettes throughout the collection and an emphasis on patterns with relaxed wraps or folds asserted a soft sensuality. Touch was key here, and was manifested on both conceptual and literal levels in Lees looped and fringed looks in black-and-white triple-ply jersey. The weave, he explained after the show, was inspired by the structure of skin. And the textile that resultedLees main technical innovation herehad a compelling muscularity. You could intuit the hand that had worked those jersey loops. All of which is to say, when Lee was on today, he was very on. And he was more on than off. Alongside the scuba dresses, however, there were a clutch of filler looks that should have stayed with the sales team in the showroomto wit, the suede biker jacket and slashed miniskirt, or the anodyne dress of cobweb lace. Dion Lee is Mr. Focus when it comes to the micro: If he ever figures out how to direct that focus to the macro, there will be no stopping him.$$When Donna Karan debuted DKNY in 1989, she specifically declined to categorize the looks she produced as fashion. Fashion has seasons. It changes over time. What DKNY was about, Karan told reporters, was clothes. In other words, durable staple pieces that suited the on-the-go lifestyle of the brands target clientele. DKNY launched casual and took on a more formal tone as time went on; the brands most iconic look, perhaps, is the early-90s-era pinstriped power suit. That was the primary point of reference for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne, the popular pair behind the brand Public School, as they took the DKNY reins. To focus on the pinstriped suit was a canny choice on their part. Where they faltered, though, was on emphasizing fashion over clothes. Times have changed since DKNY first came on the scene. Chow and Osborne are perfectly aware of that, and their riff on the power suit included exactly zero actual power suits. Rather, what they offered to the present-day DKNY woman was a handful of broad-shouldered, wide-lapel pinstripe blazers, and a dazzling variety of de- and reconstructed power suit looksto wit, a sarong-style pinstriped skirt, a pinstriped tunic dress with an attached cotton skirt with shirttail hems, and broken pinstripe silk prints. There were sheer windowpane-striped fabrics, worn layered, and vertically ribbed knits that extended the pinstripe theme, as well as shirtdresses and papery white tailored pieces that toyed with other key elements of the power suit look. Some of these adaptations came off better than othersmenswear experts that they are, Chow and Osborne cut a very mean blazer, and their layered tank dresses with shirttail hems and sheer T-shirt dresses with knit underpinnings successfully updated the relaxed attitude of the original DKNY for a modern audience. The curious thing about this collection was that it simultaneously betrayed Chow and Osbornes deep respect for the aesthetic codes of the house theyve taken over, and their reluctance to embrace what those codes once meant. One of the ways times have changed since 1989 is that DKNY is a giant brand now, and so, to some degree, commercial imperatives may be at work. Staple pieces dont have much novelty factor on the sales floor. But it would have been nice to feel that Chow and Osborne had thought a little harder about the lifestyle, today, of the DKNY woman, and what kinds of essentials she might need. To their credit, Chow and Osborne approached this show with a healthy dose of humility. As they explained backstage, the missing piece motif, witnessed in the broken pinstripe prints and the pleated half-skirts, among other looks, was meant to express their sense that theyre still learning about the DKNY woman. Shes coming together, they said. But shes not all there yet.$$Stefano Gabbana was sitting amid a sea of accessoriesvelvet slippers with turned-up toes, earrings in the shape of lemons and oranges, crocheted raffia bags, wooden clogs with rose-painted enameled soles, and gigantic sunglasses decorated with flowers and crystalsin the Dolce & Gabbana studio before their show. Meanwhile Domenico Dolce was coaxing laughs from a model as he fitted her into a black lace bra and skirt and proceeded to demonstrate how he wanted her to first sashay the runway, then stop to take a selfie. You see? exclaimed Gabbana. We dont believe in fashion for trends any more. We want to show emotion. Just enjoy!  Their inspiration boards were pasted with printouts of vintage posters advertising the attractions of Capri, Venice, Rome, and Florence; movie stills of Italian stars; and pictures of all kinds of handmade, homemade souvenir embroideries. This summer, the designers have moved on from exploring Sicilian history to seeing Italys glories through the eyes of the foreign tourists who began to flood into the country after World War II. There, visitors found little shops selling embroidered circle skirts and sundresses, printed scarves, sandals, straw hatsthings that Italian women had been making at home to cheer themselves up in times of austerity. This is where the first boutiques came from, explained Gabbana. We think it was the beginning of Italian fashion. And it was because foreigners saw it and liked it! Sometimes we Italians dont appreciate all the things we have here! Stepping back a bit to view the D&G show through the prism of the season, it seems that Italian style and culturethe flamboyant, sensual, colorful sides of itare being appreciated again. Alessandro Michele is on the same sort of track at Gucci, and at Valentino, theres a deep exploration of the glories of Rome. In fact, Dolce & Gabbana were actually on the scene first, and have succeeded in grabbing girls and women from all around their world with their seasonal travelogues. If that means ditching the anxieties of fashion and just going for clothes that suit and make you happy? So be it, say Dolce & Gabbana.$$Dondup creative director Manuela Mariotti was looking at a more feminine, romantic direction for Spring; she tapped, with gusto, into the current feeling for all things bohemian in a collection that referenced poetry, rock n roll, Shakespeare, and Glastonbury. Part indie music goddess, part Ophelia fragile beauty, the Dondup girl was ready for her close-up swathed in fluid, billowy dresses with frills galore and a touch of folklore. Prints were digitally reworked from Indian motifs or suzani tapestries, giving a vibrant feel to elongated lines in bright hues that popped up from a black background. The mandatory 70s-style references were also on display: high-waisted tunics, bell sleeves, wispy fabrics, troubadour-ruffled blouses, flared cropped pants. It all made for a cohesive lineup with a graceful yet concise feel, where denim was not at the core but more of an accent, presented sparingly and in relaxed shapes. It often happens when you design a collection that you get carried away, working on an idea that then brings you in a completely different direction, said Mariotti of a process that started with a futuristic vision and then morphed into a celebration of a free feminine spirit. Empowering women and enabling them to express creativity is a theme very dear to the designer, who, despite the Ladies of the Canyon hippie vibe abundantly displayed in the collection, still loves a good, tough rock n roll gig and a well-fitted, sexy pair of denim to dance the night away.$$There comes a point in the season when the brain starts joining up the dots between collections or, in the case before us here, the trail of tarnished sequins. Something in the detail of what Dries Van Noten did todayarranging gold, copper, carnation, and pale blue paillettes in stylized, winglike patternsalso resonated across the Atlantic, with similar flashes of decoration by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte. A sense of the faded glamour of old-time movie stars (or perhaps just the fusty remains of Old Hollywood costume departments) is seeping into the edges of several shows. At Dries Van Noten it looked great, glimmering on the bodices of long, printed 1930s midi dresses, or decorating white shirts and placed on the shoulders of sweaters. A latter-day Katharine Hepburn would do them justice. Whether there are or arent some parallels between 30s and 40s escapism from World War II and our need to gaze in the opposite direction from todays conflicts, Van Noten didnt overtly draw attention to them in his notes. Still, there was the background of the show to contend with: not the gilded grandeur of the Htel de Ville this time, but a derelict industrial warehouse with rusting girders, accessed through a crumbling concrete loading bay choked with weeds. Not that there was anything melancholy or down-at-the-heels about the collection itself. Essentially it was a steady continuation of Van Notens love of rich traditional fabrics like jacquards, brocade, and shot silk, used this season in intriguing clashes of purple, yellow ocher, kingfisher blue, and watermelon. The addition of tattoo-like patterns on gloves, socks, and turtlenecks seemed to refer the eye to the Asian and tribal threads that run through the histories of such materials. There will be plenty more of the Van Notens customers favorite pantsuits, coats, blouses, and skirts next seasonif not very much to wear on a sunny summer weekend or holiday.$$Dean and Dan Catens new collection for women picked up where their Spring 16 show for men left off: at the beach. Waves splashed on the backdrop of the otherwise stark set and out strutted Mariacarla Boscono in a cutout maillot and hip-slung boy pants, a tangle of colorful climbing ropes harnessing her torso. This hasnt been a big week for bathing suits, but the Catens gave us several different varieties, from sporty one-pieces to slinky little bikinis strung up with crystals. Sexy has more or less gone out of fashion in Milan, but not chez Dsquared2. Aside from those boyish trousers and a couple of pairs of high-waisted, tie-dyed jeans, the look here was seriously leggy. Pleated chiffon maxi skirts split open in the front, and otherwise it was all minis. Leather bandage dresses. Knit tube dresses worn two at a time. And, best of all, clingy scuba dresses with antecedents in Nicolas Ghesquireera Balenciaga that combined tropical prints with bold swipes of color and three-dimensional embroideries. This collection showcased the Catenss strengths: sexy, athletic silhouettes; special denim; their insatiable eye for color. It also exposed a weakness: their too-strappy, overly high platform shoes. Were not asking for Birkenstocks, even though real-life surfers do have a predilection for those old-school, cork-soled sandals, just something slightly more down-to-earth in which the models could really move.$$Duro Olowu has a talent for picking muses. His latest is the artist Amrita Sher-Gil, the Frida Kahlo of India, as Olowu described her, who managed to establish both an impressive body of work and an equally impressive reputation as a freethinking sexual experimenter before she died suddenly at the age of 28. Olowus silhouettes this season were a touch suggestive of those of India in the last days of the Rajthose late 30s bias cuts, broad lapels, and built-up shoulders fit neatly into his idiombut, mainly, it was Sher-Gils spirit that he drew on for his new collection. He conjured her via a mix of boldness and ultra-femininity. The boldness came through in the prints, the best of which was a dot-and-stripe on silk that Olowu confessed hed doodled while on the telephone. (Never throw anything away, is the moral of that story.) There was also a painterly yet graphic wild orchid print, which Olowu executed with his typically canny sense of color. Olowus clothes always have a feminine flaireven his tailored pieces boast a certain voluptuousness. He doubled down on that here, showing lots of looks that featured flounces and ruffles. A long ruffle-hemmed camisole, worn with a matching likewise ruffled long skirt for a tiered effect, made for one of the collections standout looks. Another was a black dress open in the back and ruffled down each side; Olowu doesnt usually mess around with neutrals, but this frocks all-black color (or lack thereof) only showcased the grace of its cut. There was a similarly appealing sense of frankness to the cotton pieces in cobalt and khaki. As noted, Sher-Gil died young. Perhaps that accounts for the fact this collection seemed an unusually youthful one for Olowu. It was hard to put a finger on where that tone came from exactlythese clothes werent a far cry from those Olowu has created in the past. Maybe it was the extra skin on display, about the back and shoulders; maybe it was the way these pieces, even down to the gowns, exuded an air of thrown-on informality. Whatever it was, the youthful kick added to the appeal of Olowus familiar aesthetic, without diminishing its friendliness to women of all ages, styles, and shapes.$$Perhaps the easiest way to explain Each x Other is to think of it as Fashion x Statement. Designers Jenny Mannerheim and Ilan Delouis once again turned out attitude-enhancing clothes conducive to art parties (no coincidence the show took place at Emmanuel Perrotins spare gallery in the Marais). Then they recruited ongoing collaborator, poet-artist Robert Montgomery, as well as editor Jefferson Hack, to anchor the collection in idiosyncratic aphorisms. You sleep on the feathers of birds and their flights fill your dreams, from the former; Hack the system (in which the letters HA appear dripped over an FU) from the latter. Using words to build a wardrobe, explained Mannerheim, reinforces the semiotics of style  and self-expression. Basically, we can choose to communicate overtly by sporting an oxford shirt patched and embroidered with Montgomerys words, or a T-shirt printed and embroidered with Hacks. Or else we leave ourselves open to interpretation when we wear a mannish peony pink suit, or a tailored jacket featuring unraveled, pleated cuffs. Like the contrast in tone established by their guest contributors (who, incidentally, have known each other for 15 years), the collection boiled down to counterintuitive pairings: striped silk pajama pants with a black leather bra; a languid ivory robe coat disciplined with black straps down the sleeves, and extra-long feather-printed shirttails trailing from snug cavalry jackets. There was also a Belgian influence  la Dries, Ann, and Veroniqueunspoken yet unmistakablewhich they used to dial up the poetic rawness. Mannerheim mentioned how artists, be it the Beats or Impressionists, have proven stronger as collectives than as individuals. And indeed, one cant help but wonder whether this duo is too reliant on its Other. But then, as one of Hacks other musings seemed to suggest, the essence of cultural is the cult.$$In recent seasons, Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta have risen to industry-wide prominence with their label, often described as arty, avant garde, or post-gender. The RISD grads have a real point of view (a rarer thing than you might think), which is unlike anything else on the New York schedule. For Spring they came up with an evocative collection, working, as usual, without set concepts (no Paris in the 70s or the work of Jackson Pollock for these two). When the bicoastal designers convened in their New York studio to prepare for todays show, they were struck by a feeling that fairly pulsed through their samples: lust. Whether the stuff of the id or just ideas that are bubbling around in Pops collective unconsciousness (some would say between the runway and the red carpet, were more preoccupied with baring it all than ever before), these clothes were hot-blooded and also eerily poignant. For some, the nudity (transparent pieces galore) on Eckhaus Lattas catwalk will be the foremost topic of conversation, but as Eckhaus and Latta approached the idea, it had to be among fashions least gaze-oriented expressions of the body. These might be clothes about titillation, but they didnt seem intended to titillate. Chalk some of that up to the casting choices: Alongside proper models were extended EL family of various ages and walks of life (Dev Hynes, Juliana Huxtable, Alexandra Marzella, and Grace Dunham, among others). Even the bits that didnt bare it all revealed plenty. Consider pants slashed along the knees or the back of calves, or a slip dress hem that fell above the knee to reveal a flash of thigh. Even when Rihanna shows up in a sheer body stocking, theres the sense that she has revealed less than these clothes did. The collection was largely stripped bare, with gorgeous, anemone-like body pieces crafted from glass bugle beads functioning as one of a couple of nods to self-ornamentation in the traditional sense. Beyond the conceptual, there were plenty of just plain great clothes here, and wearable to boot. The most transparent styles would work well for layering; meanwhile, a cropped suede mock turtleneck and the sensuous peach velvet suit were things that many a front row guest was keen to wear straight off the runway. The cerebral and the visceral in one collection? Now, thats versatility.$$Edeline Lee drew upon a pleasing confluence of inspirations this season. The London-based designer was having a Richard Diebenkorn moment, appreciating the painters Ocean Park series, when it struck her that the artists palette, and his geometries, dovetailed with those of the designers of the Memphis Group. The graphic Memphis look is trending in fashion these days, and Lee wound up leaning toward that aesthetic as she whipped up pieces for her new collection; the influence was particularly clear in items such as the shift and maxi-length shirtdress featuring a multicolored geometric placement of prints. These looks had plenty of pop, but Lee was onto something fresher in the garments that conjured Diebenkorns more poetic tone and softer line. Specifically, the designer had winners in her twisted tops and dresses in a painterly jacquard, and the plainspoken white or pastel-colored halter tops and culottes, which suggested Diebenkorns brand of California cool without hammering the reference home. Elsewhere, a pencil dress that collaged several pastel-patterned fabrics married the softness of Diebenkorns canvases with the architectural sensibility of the Memphis school. Lee sometimes has a habit of overworking her designs, but she mostly kept a lid on that here. She flubbed a few pieces by introducing unnecessary sculptural flourishes or insisting on an out-of-whack proportion, but where she kept her looks simple, and let their fine materials, gorgeous palette, and cheerful geometries do the talking, the clothes didnt just speak, they began to sing.$$Tethering high-fashion values to sustainable ones isnt an easy task, yet its something that creative director Danielle Sherman has managed to do since she took the helm of Edun in 2013. The brands commitment to producing ethically sound clothing in Africa is now a decade deep, thanks to founders Ali Hewson and Bono, and for Sherman the continent has been a rich source of inspiration too.  This season it was the ceremonial dance costumes of the Kuba Kingdom in Central Africa that piqued the designers interest, and those familiar with the tribes distinctive graphic textiles might have picked up on the influence in the hand-loomed polka-dot pattern on a fringed jumpsuit. Beyond that, though, the references were anything but literal. Intricate African craftwork was subtly woven throughout insteadbe it on the tassel of a pointy slipper that was made in Morocco, or the macram trimming of a modish cropped suit fabricated in Madagascar.  There was a gentle 30s sway to the collection tooa nod to Dada performance artist Sophie Taeuber-Arpand you could see signs of it in the contrast stitching of pleated pinafore dresses  and the neckline of a charming sailor-inspired look. One standout top in workmans orange was a particularly compelling take on the off-the-shoulder trend thats been sweeping both the runway and the streets this season. Given that the brands sleek new line of handbags was manufactured in South Africa, its clear that Sherman is charting new territory with Edun in more ways than one.$$People only vaguely familiar with the label Electric Feathers may be tempted, viewing its collections, to see very little change over the years. Members of the growing Electric Feathers club can see the evolution, however. Designer Leana Zuniga is committed to certain looksblouson trousers, architectural sundresses, rope-necked jumpsuitsbut shes updated her silhouettes of late, and elevated her fabrications. The most obvious change this season was Zunigas deployment of print, which she generally eschews. Her fine stripe and tonal ikat introduced a distinct, albeit understated sense of rhythm to the pieces where they were found, while a more graphic print of joined hands added some jolt to the new collection without detracting from its overall, minimalist hippie vibe. Electric Feathers aficionados will also note that Zuniga jettisoned her signature harem pant silhouette in favor an exaggerated jodhpur; girls with a religious affinity for harem hems can continue to find them in the one-shoulder, knee-length romper, another new shape. Zunigas best innovation on that front, however, was her broad-legged trouser and jumpsuit, with an overlayer of fabric that made the items read more like a voluminous skirt or dress. Pieces like that explain the Electric Feathers cult: These are clothes impossible to categorize as casual or dressy. You can wear them either way, and theyre both at once. The tailored garments that punctuated the collection erred more toward the casual side; items in peach-toned silk lam veered dressy. But Zunigas allergy to fussiness always prevails, and to such a degree that its possible to overlook the rigor of her method. But make no mistake: As this season reaffirmed, Leana Zuniga brings a steel-spined discipline to bear on her project, which is to reinvent the look and feel of the basic.$$Elie Saab is an eveningwear specialist with an established formula for often monochromatic, unapologetically romantic gowns studded with embellishment thats as intricate as his ambition is straightforward: Saab wants to make his customers happy. Many of these customersliterally, hundreds of themwere at his show today, as usual accounting for one enormous big-haired and super-spritzed bank of seating at his Tuileries venue. What they saw, though, seemed subtly different from the designers tried-and-tested narrative. Its not different, demurred the man himself backstage afterward. Its the same. But the mix is different.  In short, this meant the insertion of more separates and versatile day-to-night pieces before the introduction of Saabs nocturnal standards. For proof, inspect the first looks on two of his big-name castings. Both Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner wore mid-length dresses; Hadids was tiered in blue lace, Jenners black and with an empire line. Over these, they wore bomber jacketsHadids in rich candy-striped gazar, Jenners in a more softly toned floral embroidery. Although he is not entirely new to the bomber, to put both of these bound-to-be-Instad models in the jacket sent a message; this was Saab-meets-street. To underline that, there was a distinctly un-Saab black-flashed white tracksuit worn with flat sandals and Jenners floral bomberwhich acted as a radical foil to the more conventional pussy-bowed white jacket and wide pants in broderie anglaise that had preceded it. Leather mini suits with small floral cutouts; a soft silk armless striped jacket; a cute black lace bomber; and a crystal-spattered, floral-patched, halter-neck white minidress  (almost tennis-like in its silhouette) were a few other examples of the new elements in Saabs mix. It made for a pleasantly broadened watching experience. But he was careful to emphasize, however, that he wasnt about to throw the baby out with the bathwater: He makes a mean macram lace gownsimultaneously wistful and willful of aspectand there were plenty here. The closer to the finale, the denser the eveningwear became, alive with fin, sparkle, ripple, and train. By the time his stars reappearedJenner in a deep-V crystal and lace jumpsuit with two trails of sheer black silk that ran from shoulder to ankle and whipped in the air as she walked, and Hadid in a complicatedly luxe-goth black open-front dress of lace and silk panelsnormal service had resumed. Ive just met many of my clients now and everybody is happy, reported Saab. And if theyre happy, hes happy.$$The playful, artisanal vibes that trended heavily on the Fall runways are still a big message for Spring 16, particularly for contemporary brands like Elie Tahari. The designer was thinking about the intersection of natural and future this season, so he moved away from the architectural silhouettes hes known for and embraced an easier, more bohemian sensibility. Billowing chiffon dresses, deconstructed tweed jackets, and loose-fitting trousers in soft shades of taupe, cream, and black felt destined for a trip to the sun-baked desert. New for Tahari was the mix of textures, like a jeweled tank with a raw linen skirt or a suede safari jacket over a ramie dress. Pat Cleveland took the stage in a twill coat spliced with swaths of lace appliqu; paired with ankle-length pants and gladiator sandals, it was arguably the best outfit. Cleveland always looks sensational, but she embodied Taharis ideal woman in that all-white ensemble: It was sharp, sophisticated, and feminine, but with a new sense of warmth.$$Kym Ellerys inspiration this season was the 1969 work Wrapped Coast by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, which found the famed land artistes covering one and a half miles of rocky Sydney coastline in tarp. The reference was legible, on a literal level, in the clothes that Ellery showed this morning, but it almost worked better as a metaphor for her development as a designer in the past year: Ellery has always exuded a vast ambition, but she seems now to have made peace with the idea that the only way to execute her ambitions is to discipline them, strap them down. The designers evolved sense of rigor was nowhere better demonstrated here than in her approach to volume. She still likes her clothes to take up lots of space, but she found lots of ways in this collection to control her volumes, or concentrate them into small, significant gestures. An example of the latter were Ellerys artfully suspended bell-shaped sleeves; one particularly good instance of the former was the navy silk sundress that shed gathered, here and there, to create rows of soft pleats. Ellerys volumes felt targeted and specific, in other words. With volume playing a supporting role, much of the drama of this collection came from its fabrications. Ellery is a textile obsessive, and she deployed some outstanding ones this seasonvelvets printed in a sea-pod pattern; a feathery cream-colored knit fused to create weight; cloudy jacquard; crepes, silks, and shirting cottons with an ultra-luxe hand. You didnt have to get close to the clothes to appreciate the excellence of the materials; it was self-evident from the way everything draped. Ellerys standout material, though, was the crinkly metallic fabric she used in her shows terrific closing looks. Ellery showed off her design maturity in those looks by not gilding the lilythe fabric was gilded enough, all it required was a simple, pencil-snug shape.$$Great designers greatness is stamped on our memory by the signature codes they leave behind them. Hence, when other designers succeed the houses founder, they face a challenge: a delicate wrestle between the codes they have signed up to inherit and the urge to express their own point of view. Their own codes, in fact. Today Fausto Puglisi cleverly sucked the tension out of that dialectic by focusing on Emanuel Ungaros joyfully frothy output of the late 60s and early 70s. It was a neat little maneuver; by sidestepping Ungaro-in-his-80s-pomp for Ungaro juvenilia, Puglisi had something new to play with. As the mood board demonstrated, Ungaro in the 60s was a man of his timeand a designer whose years working at Balenciaga and most powerfully at Courrges could be seen in his work. Puglisi chose to focus on a set of sweetly provocative floral macram looks, all froth and of-that-era liberation touched with a softened Space Age futurism. Impressively, Puglisi re-established a connection with the Swiss factory that made Ungaros 60s pieces to create a wonderfully psychedelic lace macram of ochre flowers and paisley petals used in his last capeletteamed with matching thigh-highsand a long loose skirt. The netted-check that ran throughout the collection, even down to the weave of the pressed-foam ruffles that edged many of these looks, appeared to be lifted from a pair of pants one of the mood board images showed Ungaro fitting on Twiggy. A harder, more Puglisi-ish preoccupationFaustian?expressed itself in the ringlet bonding on black vinyl and hot pink skirts, and as suspension on floral-scattered bustiers. A little bit bondage, maybe, but also . . . romantic? Puglisi ventured backstage; we had a laugh at that. This is not a collection for wallflowers or delicate petalsbut for a woman in search of punchy, in-your-face prettiness, it will have allure.$$Emilia Wickstead, a designer known for dressing some of the most high-profile women in London society, rolled out a bubblegum pink carpet for her models today. That saccharine color was perhaps a nod to the 50s optimism that inspired the collection, which was awash with soft hues recalling the era, such as pistachio, mustard, and apricot. It was the floral prints, though, which could have been swiped from a 50s dining room, that made the biggest impression. The cropped high-waisted pants and blouse that were sprigged with contrasting flower arrangements, for instance, were a modern way to wear the traditional, ladylike motif. Of course dresses are still Wicksteads mainstay, and there were plenty to choose from. The designer isnt one to shy away from volume; one billowing geometric print look fell somewhere between a cape and a dress, and another came with an impressive Watteau train. Her experiments with proportion were at their most successful when confined to the sleeve of a frock; somehow the gathered bishop sleeves felt more medieval than mid-century modern, a vaguely Game of Thrones-ian feeling that has been coming through this season. (Incidentally, Michele Clapton, the shows costume designer, is up for an Emmy Award this weekend.) That subtle yet dramatic approach to evening will no doubt find favor with Wicksteads circle of well-dressed and well-connected fans.$$Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, it has been said. Emilio de la Morena took that principle to heart this season. And thank goodness: De la Morenas dressmaking talents shine brightest when he pares his looks down to their essences, yet he frequently evinces an aversion to doing that, as though afraid his designs wont seem distinctive unless he overcomplicates them. Not so here. This was a collection with a straightforward mandatepretty dressesand its flourishes were relatively few. Which made for some knockout frocks to wear to a cocktail do.  The designer presented a fabric-focused lineup. De la Morena has great taste when it comes to textiles, and the materials he used served to elevate his most matter-of-fact looks. The cream-color jacquard, for instance, introduced an earthy note to a soign pencil dress, courtesy of the pebbled texture. Tonal striped black gazar was not only sexy, given its semi-transparency, but it also allowed de la Morena to play with his signature geometric effects without detracting from the collections understated mood. Elsewhere, plain pink or yellow silk had a perfect, limpid drapeone of those qualities in clothes that looks no-brainer but is actually devilishly hard to achieve. The most striking pieces, meanwhile, were the pastel frocks and dressy separates embroidered with patches in metallic brocade. The patches were in the shape of mountain flowers, de la Morena said; the pattern they made was redolent of leopard print, which wasnt a bad thing. There was also a very cool green-toned organza brocade with metallic fabric filaments left exposed. The effect was a touch uncanny, in a good way, and here in particular de la Morenas strategy of hewing to classic A-line silhouettes allowed the specialness of his material to speak for itself. This collection wasnt simple in the sense that it was minimal or basic. It was simple in that it wasnt cluttered by a bunch of superfluous ideas. There were just a couple of superfluities; but then, simplicity is a discipline. Its a muscle. This season, de la Morena began again to work it out.$$Emilio Pucci opened his first store in Capri, in 1949, serving up kaleidoscopic printed dresses that by the 60s had become signifiers of a jet-set lifestyle recognizable well beyond Italian vacation destinations. Massimo Giorgetti, the young founder of MSGM, one of Milan's recent success stories, took the wheel at the iconic house earlier this year after Peter Dundass departure. For his debut today, Giorgetti started at the seaside, which was the right instinct: As the birthplace of Pucci, it was a natural place for a new beginning.  Giorgetti uncovered some compelling pieces from the archives; a glance at his backstage mood board suggested he has an eye for the more obscure elements in the Pucci oeuvre. Unfortunately, this show was a bit of a muddle: too literal in its references (there were sea turtles and lobsters tangled up in a fishnet dress), too dependent on styling, and surprisingly low on prints. Though it seems a shame to ignore them, especially for a designer who built his business on irreverent mashups of color, texture, and pattern, prints aren't the only route to success at Pucci. The industry has seen enough revivals to know that it takes more than reverence for a houses heritage to make things click for an incoming designer. But spelling out the founder's first name in script across the back of a slip dress, along the borders of a shift, and on the straps of flat sandals isn't the way to go either. Hiring Giorgetti for the job indicated that the Pucci powers-that-be were after a radical change, targeting the street style and Instagram-obsessed younger crowd that's been his sweet spot at MSGM. That in and of itself isnt a negative, and there are clearly larger opportunities at lower price points. But Giorgetti has some work to do to right this ship.$$Has a gray Armani pantsuit ever before been worn with a cropped T-shirt with a smiley emoji on it? Doubtful, but theres always a first time for everything, and that was the way Giorgio Armani chose to open his Spring Emporio show, maybe to emote a little casualness. He got rid of his runway, too, and instead had his models walk on an illuminated path, as if at street level (that is, as street level as you can get when youre showing inside the vast Tadao Ando theater youve installed inside your own lofty building). In a funny way, this is a favorable fashion moment for Armani againthings have generally turned relaxed and casual, and he is once more a flat-shoe man in a flat-shoe time (exactly what Armani endured during the long reign of mega-platforms may only be imagined). So now he can get back to his natural state, putting models in low, pointy ankle boots and a variety of casual-formal, sporty-pretty shorts, jackets, and tops for spring. Gone are the days when Armani shows were essays in a million shades of greige. (There was a time for greige, lets remember: It was the color of armor an entire generation of pioneering American power women wore to go into executive battle from the late 70s through the early 90s.) This time, he added a powdery bois de rosepink by any other namein a variety of techniques that hinted at flowers, be that brocaded floral tailoring, or a soft hybrid of blouse and jacket, laser-cut into overlapping petals.$$Erdems first look said it all: A girl with a slightly trance-like expression on her pale face was treading her way along a red earth pathway, prettily dressed in a delicate Victoriana yoked dress of pale gray chiffon, strewn with embroidered pink and white flowers, which seemed to be coming apart at the shoulders. So far, so enchantingbut what the designer said about his inspiration will make you go back and take a long second look: It was about prairie madness, he explained backstage. In 1862, Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead Act, which gave single women and widows the right to their own plots of land in the West, as long as they stayed there for five years. So there were all these women coming from their homes in Europe, bringing their clothes and the remnants of their lives in Norway and Germany and places like thatand they started to suffer from agoraphobia and all kinds of psychological illnesses. A quick Wikipedia check also shows that suicide was not uncommon among these lonely women. Could that black velvet ribbon at her neck, knotted and displaced to the side, start to look a little different in that light? Erdems productions have taken on an almost cinematic quality recently, often hinting at the backstories of imaginary girls and women who have fallen on hard times or traveled far from their secure homes. Last season, he placed his show in a down-at-the-heels 50s apartment set belonging to an heiress whose hopes in life were unraveling; before that, it was a tropical greenhouse for a tale about a Victorian woman botanist. Part of this, he always says, comes from spending his boyhood obsessively watching Merchant Ivory films. Hes a romantic who can only design once he knows the character hes dressing. The prairie girls, with their extraordinary wardrobes of ankle-length flounced dresses made of beautifully wrought lace, crochet, and embroidery fabrics, are his sequel. They arrived by railroadpushed along on an actual train track in a former freight yard in the hinterland of Kings Cross station, with a few sticks of furniture to their names, and then proceeded to make their long, melancholy walk to a crackly soundtrack of Emily Dickinsons poetry. Well, put it another way: Erdem may be brilliant at research and atmospherics, but in the real world he also knows the minds of the women he actually dresses. Next summer, they are basically going to be in prettiness heaven.$$Since her very first collection in 2005, Erin Fetherston immediately established her universe as one of whimsy and hyper-femininity. Jeans have hardly had a place in the designers fairy tale. But this season she surprised by showing a handful of laid-back denim pieces, inspired by fashions perennial muse, Jane Birkin. Fetherston should step out of her comfort zone more often: The overalls, shorts, and culottes in soft dark denim provided a welcome antidote to the designers tendency toward the overly sweet. Also new for the brand: a capsule collection of minaudires that recalled needlepoint hoops and were stitched with cute phrases, faces, or the word love. Branching out into accessories is almost always a smart decision for a fledgling labeleven more so when they are as Instagrammable as these. Fetherston hit the nail on the head. Needlepoint was a recurring theme in the collection, paying homage to the designers other muse this season: Anne of Avonlea, the early-20th-century, Prince Edward Islanddwelling heroine of the Anne of Green Gables series. Arcadian reverie, is how Fetherston described it. There was certainly a pastoral beauty to the floral-print dresses and skirts, some cut with a train or layered with delicate sheer fabric that billowed behind the models as they walked. Slips in sky blue, baby pink, and navy provided a base for some of these sheer looks and also stood on their own, topped, at times, with a matching knife-pleated capelet. White lace maxi dresses with high necks hinted at the Edwardian lace and collars worn by Anne in her dayand reclaimed decades later by Birkin. Like all of Fetherstons collections, Spring was romanticyet it was a grown-up romance.$$Its a passion play of opposites, said an upbeat Ermanno Scervino backstage before rushing out to greet Italys First Lady, Agnese Landini, a friend and loyal client. The collection he presented today celebrated his signature hyper-feminine, Italian-diva style, though he tempered it with a contrasting dose of masculine and sporty elements. Fortunately for Scervinos fans, this did not tarnish the glam factor; on the contrary, it polished the edges, giving the lineup a contemporary feel. Craftsmanship took center stage with an elaborate display of materials, textures, and finishes. Lace was utilized in myriad waysbonded with a double layer of delicate guipure, embroidered with macram and jacquard feuillage, and fused with cashmere pashmina to sumptuous effect. The silhouettes were either elongated and slim or sensual and shapely; evening fabrics were worked into tailored day coats and pantsuits. Light organza gave shape to a classic tuxedo duster worn with cropped pants and flat embroidered babouches. In another clever conception, a sporty olive green jumpsuit was paired with a luxe mink jacket dyed a bright shade of bubblegum pink. Masculine shirts in crisp striped poplin were a chic counterpoint to tight duchesse satin pencil midi skirts, while shades of lipstick red served as an unexpected and striking contrast to a delicate periwinkle hue. The result was a lineup of edge and modernity, spicing up Scervinos trademark sensual touch.$$Though Escada wont officially turn 40 until 2018, the Munich-based brand has already started celebrating. For his Spring 2016 offering, fashion director Daniel Wingate sought to emphasize the history of the label without getting stuck in the past. The piece that perhaps best typified this effort was a silky, tailored blazer inspired by Escadas scarves from the late 60s and 70s, which was paired with smart black trousers: Its the kind of thing that serves a woman equally well at the office or at a cocktail party. Versatility and comfort were key this season. Looks were styled with flats to emphasize a certain effortlessness to the clothes that will appeal to Escadas busy career woman: Slouchy trousers, roomy culottes, and oversize tunics popped up in neutrals as well as primary colors like red and yellow (or limoncello as the brand calls it). The eveningwear was also carefully considered. A romantic, delicate blush pink cardigan was a thoughtful additionfor the demure or the always-coldto the matching strapless dress it was styled with. Escada is best when it sticks to simplicity. The floral pantsuit and chain-link belt felt overcomplicated, and the jumpsuit-gown combo, though daring, seemed a little out of place. Still, simple neednt mean boring: One of the strongest looks consisted of perforated white leather culottes styled with a white shirt that wrapped at the waist.$$This time last year, Esteban Cortazar presented a collection that hed already sold to retailers during the Resort seasonorders were placed even before the press weighed in. While rethinking the industry cycle might not be half as sexy as Roos Abelss absshe being the very young model who opened tonights showit does help explain how Cortazar seems to have settled into the fashion firmament so fast.  And now that his brand is viable, he can start having fun, which meant channeling an otherworldly creature as his latest muse. Hence the python bra top, asymmetric metallic leather gilet, and platform sandals encrusted with Swarovski crystals. Compared with Cortazars past two go-rounds, this collection felt less mannered, more spontaneous, as he put it. He credited the ideas to night-long parties in Ibiza this summer, and how the clubbing impulse dates back more than half his life, to when he was a precocious teen in Miami. Beyond flaunting youthful vibes, the pieces boasted savoir faire. Laser-cut skins were backed in metallic jersey; Lurex knit was developed to resemble a surface of jewels and then lined in cashmere so that it would feel soft, not scratchy; and metal rings were affixed onto coats like contraband watches, creating a clanging chorus with each step. It was about not being afraid to just play, said Cortazar. The past two seasons I was building her universe; this season I just wanted her to be brave. A clingy jersey dress slashed with shimmer has already proven a retail favorite, as has an oversize shirt that billows from behind. Tellingly, they represent two of Cortazars easier looks; yet theyre sure to get heads turning from dusk to dawn.$$Veronica Etro today delivered a sumptuous medley of house staplesthe kaleidoscopic prints, the rich concentration of color, and the bohemian sensibilityin a collection that also melded European folk costume, Victorian Pre-Raphaelite nostalgia, haberdashery, Arts and Crafts, and a shot of Ballets Russes. It was pretty busy. Yet it was to Etros great credit that with so very much going on here, at first glance nothing on the runway ever seemed especially OTT.For while there was plenty of ruche and flounce and ruffle in her silhouettes, particularly on the soft undulations of her sleeves, these were never jarringly proportioned pieces.To get lost you had to stareintothe clothes. On one look alone, quilted printed cotton was shot against gridded twine run through with embroidered ribbons that were overlaid with ivory silk and hemmed with silver lace above a scalloped hem. Reversible bombers combined strata of ribbon and dvor silk. A lace-fringed dress was a patchwork of floral-wrought paisleypatterns drawn from the Etro archiveoverlaid with a hypnotic constellation of dots that recalled the antipodean psychedelia of Kean Etros most recent menswear show. Backstage, Etro said that she had left some of the finishes rough in the wine-toned closing section to resist the sweetness and whimsy so much ornament might otherwise muster. There was friction and roughness and pain in this romance; just so, emotional perfection was not the objective. In a season that is betting heavy on 2010s appropriations of kooked-up 70s approximations (thinkPicnic at Hanging Rock) of Edwardian lady laciness, Etros analogue abandon was a cynicism-free take: Victoriana eminently incorporable into the cool-girl wardrobe.$$Eudon Choi spirited showgoers away to Gaelic lands with a palette-cleansing collection that sprung from the fantastical paintings of John Anster Fitzgerald. The Victorian artist, known for fairy-filled works that may have been opium-fueled, brought an ethereal touch to Chois otherwise minimalist spring outing. The sprightly references came through from the delicate sprays of pale blue lace that showed up on sleeves and skirts, right down to the pleasingly off-kilter, mismatched Victoriana boots. There was another, very on-point mood at work here though: the waif-like lines of the grunge era. This was a fairy fantasy with an undeniably 90s edge. The decades strong, stripped-back feel appeared in the industrial slate fabrics that opened the show on layered dresses and capes, and later in the raw-edged drape shirts and asymmetric slash skirts hewn in tactile, Irish linen. As the dreamy chords of Portisheads It Could Be Sweet played out, the palette shifted from cerise to soft peach to midnight blue with Mackintosh-y dresses that Choi intends to be worn to smart gallery shows. There was a breezy, oversize silhouette throughout, as well as a minor obsession with drawstrings, which allowed Choi free play with shape and volume. Gone were the harsh and architectural lines of Fall. In their place came a lesson in restrained prettiness. For the finale, these proportions became even more exaggerated in pale hued jacquard day gowns that provided full cover. Theres so much body consciousness in the world, Choi said after the show, referring to the protective feel of the more voluminous looks. I wanted to create an elegant and easy beauty that allows an escape from that.$$Brooklyn may be trending in Paris, but the vibe at Faith Connexions headquarters is distinctly L.A. sur la Seine. Step through the door at its htel particulier (part of which is a small hotel) and a certain very famous someones matte black Porsche Panamera is parked there. In the courtyard, members of fashions fabulous class are gossiping while eating lunch while texting on their iPhones. At the reception, a fashion shoot in which a blogger poses, lying shoeless underneath an antique chair, is taking place.  Upstairs in the showroom, where the racks are lined with torn jeans, graffitied leather jackets, and lacy white dresses that look like they stepped off the set of Guns N' Roses November Rain video, the sales are brisk. Faith Connexion has never done a runway show and refuses to name its designer (it's more or less an open secret that former Balmain creative director Christophe Decarnin is in charge). The brand has caught on in spite of all that, because nobody nails the grungy, I-woke-up-like-this lifestyle better. For spring, the attitude is essentially the same as previous seasons, only more California-fied. Tropical prints registered as new, as did sweatshirts spray-painted with palm trees. Hammer pants, which take their name from Oakland, Californias native son, MC Hammer, even turned up. But the big winners here will be the oversize army jackets tagged by Faith Connexion's resident graffiti artists, whose appeal appears to be universal. A rep reports they sent 25 of said jackets to a Seoul, Korea, store and they sold out in a week. In a savvy development, the brand is now also customizing the jackets to clients' specifications$$Caitlin Price is London fashions latest phenom. Much like Simone Rocha, Pricewho showed her second collection today as part of the Fashion East lineup of emerging designersmade her mark on the scene by inventing a new kind of girl, one with her own distinctive look and attitude. Only time will tell whether the Caitlin Price woman will prove to be as multidimensional as the one Rocha dreamed up. This season, Price has sharpened her outlines, showing new versions of the luxuriously fabricated, beautifully detailed tracksuits that she offered in her debut, and expanding her dialogue between high and low aesthetics by creating half-gown skirts and cutaway nightclubbing dresses that had the tough tone and casual mien of streetwear. The mix of silk and poly taffetas in the looks underscored the high-low theme. Price is up to something genuinely interesting, but she gave few hints here as to how she plans to augment her design vocabulary. In the meantime, though, she has gotten everyones attention. This Is The Uniform, a new entry into Fashion East, is the brainchild of recent Goldsmiths grad Jenna Young. Its her bad luck that she was showing with Price, inasmuch as the two cover similar territory. Youngs debut likewise toyed with ways to draw appreciative attention to and elevate the look of working-class youth. Her take was less audacious and clear-cut than Prices, but on the other hand, more expansive. Her mix of sharp crop tops, net sweaters, A-line minidresses, and trousers slungvery  inventivelybelow the hip hinted at a strong instinct for creating the elements of a womans wardrobe as opposed to a few strong headline pieces. Fellow Fashion East newcomer Richard Malone also concerns himself with the working class. His modus operandi is more conceptual, however, than that of Young or Price. For starters, theres his approach to fabrication: Malones workwear materials were sourced from overstock and other types of waste, and though he elevated these fabrics by sculpting them into rather soign shapes, he maintained a sense of matter-of-factness by eschewing corsetry or other restrictive elements. His clothes are made to function. And the emphasis on wearability went to the collections overarching theme, which was a celebration of female labor, at home and in the workplace. A high-waisted, flared jumpsuit with a ruffled halter neck didnt at first seem like a garment that could withstand the trenches, but, in fact, it was cut precisely to stand up to a hard days work. Ditto a striped dress expanding in wavelike volume as it extended toward the knee. Malones look was intriguing, but it was his sensitivity to the user experience of his clothes that makes him one to keep an eye on.$$Faustine Steinmetz turned the idea of denim inside out with her first collection, and the intricate hand-loomed pieces she created from recycled thrift-store jeans were anything but basic. In her third season, the French designer is looking to grow her business beyond the confines of her atelier in East London. She partnered with a denim mill in Spain for Spring 2016, and the resulting collaboration takes her artisanal sensibilities to exciting and scalable places. Micro-pleated denim is among the new fabric developments in her repertoire (clearly the Issey Miyake ripple effect we saw come through in New York is making waves across the pond, too), and it gave a sculptural dimension to such staples as the jean jacket. To add to her experiments with true blues, Steinmetz took to deconstructing the tracksuit with what shes calling dvor jersey; one classic gray marl sweatshirt, in particular, unraveled into a stream of floor-grazing fringing. Her couture-like weaving expertise showed up in the hand of a striped polo shirt, which, like the pieces of her first collection, took a week to make. In an age when supply and demand often takes precedence in the fashion food chain, its encouraging to see a young designer picking up the thread of time-honored production values in a modern wardrobe with such spellbinding innovation.$$Fausto Puglisi admitted to a case of nerves before his show today. Since he arrived on the Milan Fashion Week scene three years ago, embroideries have been his stock in trade: bold, brassy, and full-throttle. Possessing as strong a signature as Puglisi does is something of a mixed blessing. We all love a designer with a recognizable voice, but sooner or later that voice starts to sound familiar. Puglisis new collection for Spring represented his biggest step yet away from the embellishments with which he made his name; hence the nerves.  Citing Madame Grs and Halston as reference points, Puglisi embraced silk jersey with a hand so supple, so liquid that it has to be touched to be appreciated. But even without copping a feel, you could tell he was up to something new and different with a draped ivory gown boasting an asymmetrical cape straight out of ancient Greek statuary. We expect to see that dress making the rounds this awards season: It was that soign. Other goddess dresses in that same material, be they short, or suspended from a bandeau bathing suit top, or in a bright combination of red, white, and blue struck a more expected note. They werent bad; they just didnt have that element of surprise.  In the end, this collection wasnt a complete departure anyway. There were scads of Puglisis beloved embroideries, but he gave them a novel spin, mixing honest-to-goodness seashells with sprays of multicolor rhinestones, part Malibu, part Dallas, with some fine Italian-made intarsia knits thrown into the mix. Not for the timid, but then thats never been the Puglisi way. We have a hunch that the encrusted cowboy boots, if he winds up retailing them, could become a mini cult hit.$$One can always count on a pithy comment from those Milan stalwarts Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi. Chaotic elegance, deadpanned Rimondi, describing the design duos latest collection for Fay, which is one part of the Tods empire. It was also an apt phrase to describe many of the showgoers outfits as heavy rainstorms lashed the city on its first day of runway shows, causing inevitable traffic havoc and wardrobe mayhem. But chaotic is not a word one would ordinarily use to describe these designers aesthetic, which tends to be defined by pristine, prettified clothes. This season their deft precision was worked on the military field jacket, a small point of reference, and its myriad possibilities. Where a chaotic notion entered, it was in setting the rigor of combat garb against traditional paisley curlicues, embroidery, ruching, and prints that had a shade of Bloomsbury about them. The elongated sleeve proportions added a more youthful element to the uniform improvisation. Floral-print dresses and pretty separates, like a cute blush suede frock, came with scalloped sleeves and cutout paisley swirls. To counter some of that girlishness, and with a knowing nudge to the designers desire to add a younger following to their loyal clientele, the Fay field jacket will likely have mass appeal. It hit their runway in numerous iterations: cropped and in a more urban denim version, in white. There were navy incarnations, too, and a series of embroidered styles had a semblance of Tyrolean influence. A small idea for a larger world.$$What if the Lisbon sistersthe five doomed girls at the center of The Virgin Suicideshad never killed themselves? Imagining an alternate, happier history for the Lisbons inspired the Spring collection of Felder Felder, the London-based brand designed by German identical twin sisters Daniela and Annette Felder. In their version, the Lisbons party their way from Michigan to Miami and age disgracefullythink: The Golden Girls gone wild. The oily blue in the metallic fabric of their first outfits, a sharply cut broad-lapel suit and follow-up dresses, shone sickly slick. Banana palm and flamingo prints, appliqus, and jacquards were scrambled and diffused as if squinted at through aging eyes.  There was a potent dose of the staple Felder fare that their lushly blow-dried regulars had come to whoop for: floor-length underwear revealers, skater skirts with cutaways at the hip, crop tops aplenty, and a chiffon baby doll. Yet there was a pitch at maturity, toothis show was about the Lisbons growing up, after allin a suite of Art Baselappropriate cream looks in silk jersey, twisted only by the odd Lurex-piped panel or cry-for-help undone shirt. A tomato, pink, and white color-block aside was carefully conventional. And despite the artificial whoa there! clash of pink, apricot, and gold in their tropical jacquard, the fabric was used to hew restfully nipped dresses, pencils, and outerwear.  Afterward, Annette Felder observed that this kind of harmonious dichotomy is something the designers do naturally: Its always hard and its always soft, and that comes from our being twins. So whos the hard sister and whos the gentler one? It changes! both chimed into avoid being hard on each other.$$Sick, although in quite agoodway. Thats the only possible response to the coral leather mini-bloomer playsuit that proceeded fourth in the Fendi collection today. Coral. Leather. Bloomer. Playsuit. Such a thing could no doubt cause ridicule, offense, or even pity if viewed on the everyday street. Yet when seen with our fashion glasses on, we can instantly perceive that this garment has precisely the right number of attractive-repulsive features to qualify it as ideally avant-garde. It has the puff-shoulder sleeves, the 80s-yet-not yoke, the gathering into a high-neck nearly-but-not-Victorian collar. While below, it provides exactly the correct amount of photographer-attractor leg exposure to satisfy girls who congregate at and outside fashion shows.  Fendi is a serious Roman fur and leather house of long standing, but recently Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi have been having some fun with it all. There are no references, remarked Lagerfeld as he moved through the roiling postshow throng. Retro is over, no? Still, even when hes supposedly designing against the mainstream, Lagerfelds antennae cant help transmitting a sense of the fashion news that is running through Spring. It was there in the silhouettesthe big-sleeved, high-neck, high-waisted, and pleated midi thing thats currently going on. In Fendis case, they provide the backdrop for ultra-luxurious house materials and skills: summer furs in a rattan-basketwork open-weave technique, cropped jackets in whipstitched patchwork python and braiding and smocking effects. Fendi x Karl Lagerfeld may be 50 years old as a collaboration, but in some ways its still ridiculously, friskily young. Again, in a good way.$$The palazzo pajama was originally created by Irene Galitzine, a cultivated Russian princess turned couturiere who lived in Rome in the 60s. Her clientele ranged from thegrandesdames of the Roman aristocracy to Audrey Hepburn. Jackie Kennedy was also a fan and sent her a lovely thank-you note in 1963 that read: I was so touched at your thoughtfulness in sending me your marvelous pajamas for Christmas. But it was her friend Diana Vreeland who with her usualpanache gave the chic ensemblea masculine-inspired blouse paired with wide pantsthename thats still used to these days, that has become synonymous with a sensual, androgynous, and eccentric way of dressing. The fashion world has longbeen fascinated bylounge-inspired attire; recently almost every known designerhas tapped into what has become a global trend. But for Francesca Ruffini, a refined woman with a calm demeanor, the passion for pajamas reaches back to her personal lifestyle and to her desire for both comfort and elegance. Ive always lived in a pajama because it has a uniform quality that I find appealing; itsthe first thing I wear when coming back home after a day outside, she said during the presentation of her Spring collection, held in her sprawling flat in the heart of Milan. Her pajamas are veritable pantsuits that can be worn 24/7, carrying you from day to night, or can be worn as separates: I likethe monogrammed jackets of my custom-made pajamas with a demure midi skirt; the pants look great with a tailored blazer, said the designer, while pointing out a lineup in sumptuous silks sourced in her native Como and printed exclusively in festive colors. Each lookwas accessorized by a sleeping mask that couldmorph into a graceful headband. To further demonstrate the already convincing versatility, Ruffini expanded the range with fluid robes de chambre (read: bathrobes) in elongated linesmade in liquid, languid jacquards, they were perfectto be worn as dusters or evening dresses. The effect was of subtle yet alluring seduction. She also added a bra to wear under the coats: I hate the look of exposed lingerie! she exclaimedin mockhorror. But my husband encouraged me to add a sexy-yet-elegant touch to make the look more desirable. The husband in question is Remo Ruffini, CEO of Moncler, who actually happens to know a thing or two about making a successful fashion business: His suggestions on the subject cannot be easily overlooked.$$For a line that has made its name setting the denim trends, beginning with its first pairthe ubiquitous Le Skinny Jean of 2012Frame Denims Spring 2016 presentation began with surprisingly few. Actually, there werent many bottoms at all. The new pant is no pant, laughed cofounder Jens Grede at the Soho presentation, or is it the Emperor's New Pants? Whatever the takeaway, it would have been easier if the models didnt look so good. Nearly all were clad in 70s-influenced separates (often worn, well, quite separately): Tight knit tops and tees had sleeves that extended only to the elbow and tucked into fetching A-line skirts; long, loose jeans were gently cuffed into a more girlfriend-friendly boyfriend jean silhouette; snug knit bikinis were sported under multi-pocketed denim jackets; and slouchy tops were worn seemingly alone, or over the briefest of shorts. It appeared to be, for all practical purposes, a full view into the future wardrobe of every leggy young fashionable thing on the premises, as well as those of the heavily Instagrammed runway regulars after whom they model their wardrobes.  The intended feel was that of an American girl who falls in love while visiting the 70s French Riviera then began infusing the local wardrobe with American sportswear tropes, said Grede, name-checking the story of the recording of the Rolling Stones Exile on Main St. (a rundown chateau, exercises in redefining the term louche for a generation), though the Gallic striped tops and thick elastic headbands in some looks certainly nodded to another famous Riviera-ite, namely the classic St.-Tropez bombshell herself, Brigitte Bardot (who, its worth noting, also had no problem with not wearing pants in public). Swimwear was a new venture here, born out of the organic design process that Grede and cofounder Erik Torstensson have pursued since the labels founding: New washes led to new cuts and styles of denim, which in turn inspired a shirt, trousers in suede and leather, and now, swim. Next time well do something else, said Grede. Were going to go darker, cooler. It looks like the emperors have quite a few clothes in their future after all.$$Born and bred in Naples (in Pompei, no less), Francesco Scognamiglio is still deeply in love with this city of staggering beauty and louche-ness, opposites that coexist in a web of inextricable contradictions. This clearly feels quite natural for the designer, who delves with abandon into Napless history and decadent heritage for inspiration. All that was apparent in his Spring collection, in which he referenced the esoteric Sansevero Chapel, a 16th-century masterpiece that hosts the statue of the Veiled Christa marble wonder that looks so incredibly real, as if it were made of actual flesh draped in the thinnest of fabric.  Theater, mirrors, artifice, said the designer backstage, pointing out wispy, ruffled dresses in white and shell pink, light as a feather and almost liquid in their sensuality. Transparent Chantilly lace and inconspicuous point desprit conjured up a romantic feel for fluctuating long dresses, exuding reminiscences of boudoirs and 18th-century courtesansyet they were slashed, layered, and multitiered to modern effect. Black silk mikado jackets with round shoulders felt more substantial; they came inlaid with graphic intarsia inspired by peeling stucco ceilings that looked like cracks through which a delicate jade green lining could be glimpsed. Dresses in white or black liquid satin were printed and embroidered with an oversize iris motif and adorned with an abundance of rosette appliqus; they balanced the overall barely there effect and the nude transparencies of the lineup. The craftsmanship was undoubtedly exquisite. It makes sense that Scognamigliobacked by a new investor, Malaysian entrepreneur Johann Youngwill debut his Haute Couture collection in Paris in 2016, where hell finally fulfill a childhood dream.$$Barneys New York has installed Gabriela Hearsts debut collection on its third floor, between Chlo and Cline. Not bad for a fledgling label in its first season. Hearst arrives on the scene with a pedigree; she hails from a grand Uruguayan ranching family and shes married to a descendant of William Randolph Hearst, but this is no vanity project. The proof is in that Barneys exclusive, and in her evolving collection. When she launched the line in February, it was tempting to classify Hearst as another Phoebe Philo disciple, a practitioner of the luxe minimal style that has dominated at retail for the past few years. But a season later, a distinct point of view is emerging, one that marries an urbane elegance with a rawer, even rustic look that nods at her heritage. That difference will work to Hearsts advantage, especially as the fashion pendulum swings away from restraint toward a more exuberant sensibility. There were any number of understated, smartly cut coats and coatdresses here, and theyll find plenty of customers when this collection lands on sales floors. So, too, will the streamlined strapless evening column with a built-in choker necklace (it connects to the dress in back). Inevitably, though, the items that made a stronger statement were the ones for which Hearst took bigger risks. A tank dress with floor-sweeping proportions was cut in Lurex-striped gauzebeach fabric, she called it, adding, It makes me feel comfortable when somethings not so perfect. Hearst should continue to follow that instinct. A rugged washed-cotton field jacket was one of the collections most desirable pieces. Elsewhere, she took cues from her husbands cycling uniform for a ribbed-knit cashmere dress in bold, athletic stripes. Sexy as hell, it will stand out among the sea of knits about to inundate the runways, and its one more reason Hearst should keep going her own way.$$Its the rare bird who admits hes not interested in dressing exhibitionists, but Gabriele Colangelo is one such individual. Theres no sparkling embroidery here, quipped the meticulous Italian backstage. Listening to the designer, who hails from a family of furriers, animatedly describe his seasonal fabric innovations is an uncommon experience. For his Spring collection, utilizing technology to an extent seldom seen, he shifted his attention to experiments with velvet (laser-cutting it to resemble the age-old dvor technique) and kidassia (aka goats fur), transporting the materials into shape-shifting textiles and remarkable summer statement pieces. The overall silhouette was long and lean; narrowly pleated silk tunics were paired with contrastingly hued trousers in lavender, copper, turquoise, and an eye-catching mustard. Sleeveless tops, velvet-accented slip dresses, and a wonderful velvet jumpsuit possessed a similarly elongated feel. Symmetry was occasionally broken by the unexpected tweaking of a jackets sleeves, many of which had extended cuffs. One of Colangelos most interesting new fabrications is a variation of Kentethe West African cloth produced in narrow overlapping strips and usually woven of cotton, silk, and sometimes gold thread. Colangelos version is distinguished by sheared silk threads, which from a distance resemble fur. He used the fabric to create wispy coats, trousers, and jackets that were pretty and light as a feather. Many of the outfits that followed were similarly tonal and textural, at times employing pleats under transparent silk or creative use of kidassia: For a handcrafted feel, he applied the tufty tone-on-tone material to necklines and hems or worked it as stripes, adding a 70s undercurrent and an enticing, of-the-moment feel.$$Youre so money. Recall, if you will, that unforgettable line from Swingers, delivered in the midst of a pep talk at a nightclub. Money is the primary way we denote value in our society. Youre so money means you have so much value. You are so very good. Gareth Pughs latest collection was so, so money. Literally, in that there were actual pence coins sewn onto the clothesa gesture that, in a different collection, youd be tempted to read as a statement about luxury, or something along those lines. But Pughs money wasnt raising questions. It was proposing a solution: Go out. Go balls out. Dress to the nines, as though everything this world has to offer belongs to you, because it does. You can buy whatever you want with the currency that is you. Be extravagant with yourself, and for gods sake, have fun. The high spirits of this collection, meanwhile, raised a question: What on earth got into Gareth Pugh this season? Heading backstage after this exuberant, brilliantly styled show, you half-expected to find Pugh bouncing off walls and singing the praises of a new cocktail of serotonin reuptake inhibitors or, better yet, a new love. The truth was rather more prosaic. Pugh was up to some point-making here: We each contain multitudes, was his message, and reputedly dour Gareth Pugh is perfectly capable of putting his well-developed design muscles to work in the creation of a collection with a disco mood, just as the Gothic Gareth Pugh babes hes cultivated see fit, once in a while, to slough off their cares and paint the town red.  Red was Pughs signature color this season. The color pulsed through numerous looks, from the impeccably tailored silk faille suits, with their flared, attenuated silhouettes, to the paillette-covered short-shorts made for shimmying. The paillettes made perhaps their most stunning appearance in a trim black trench coatthe way the sequins dappled about the coats chest and shoulders suggested the movement of strobe lights dancing over pitch-colored clothes. The nightclub atmospherics extended into Halston-esque draped dresses and looks in a black-and-white diamond patterned jacquard that conjured the undying incandescence of club deity Leigh Bowery. The nightclub energy was present, too, in Pughs excellent, Mongolian furtrimmed plastic jackets, with their frisson of sexual possibility (and perversity). The overall effect was magnificently louche. Pugh clearly knew hed be shocking the audience by sending out a collection premised on the pleasure principle. Did he know hed be showing them perhaps his best collection ever? He probably knew that, too. Pugh should engage his gaudy side more oftenhere he demonstrated that his rigor as a craftsman can turn pretty much any look into pure class. His artistry is so money. And Pugh has more where that came from: He can afford to spend freely.$$Displacement as a positive force? Its a theme that, in one way or another, has often coursed through Gary Grahams clothes. His keenly researched collections contain multitudes, with enough references to make an art history majors head spin. A brief shopping list of a few of his aesthetic touchstones for this season: the word asunder, Buddhist vestments, Iranian carpets, historical mourning garb, seminal experimental filmmaker Jack Smith, and Queen Elizabeth I. Generally speaking, Graham weaves together such disparate ideas with ease. Despite his period fodder, the results are unplaceable in time and geography. Take silk dresses, in an ornate print borrowed from the aforementioned Iranian rugs, or a trapeze maxi inspired by a traditional Turkish wedding dress. Paneled in black and shimmering gold, it was easy to imagine on some cool young thing at one of the citys artier events. His message got perhaps a bit muddled in a mixed-media top that married Victorian mutton-chop sleeves, tapestry, and ticking stripes. More winning were dresses in perfectly polished shapes but with plenty of grungy appeal, splattered with bleach till they reached an uncanny shade of goldenrod. Transformation of another kind was afoot in a grouping of items that riffed on the idea of remnants. Graham had lately been reading Chlo Griffins oral history of Cookie Mueller, and he tapped into the books descriptions of a thrift store in Muellers native Baltimore. The resulting pieces came edged in all manner of metallic sundries. Particularly savvy was Grahams decision to build out his offering of pieces that boast a broad appeal but make more of a statement than your pure basics. A pair of ethereal blouses, a poet number with full sleeves, and a sleeveless top with a slashed, sheer high neckline both fit the bill, as did his supple Peruvian knits in a graphic black-and-white pattern inspired by tile work. Grahams lookbook styling may have an editorial loftiness to it, but there was a surprising amount of real-world potential to the majority of these clothes.$$How do you explain a thing like the red-white-and-bluestriped sequin hot pants at Giamba today? Or, for that matter, the sequined lipstick bullets; the sequined red-painted fingernails on embroidered hands; the sequined stars, daisies, planets, hearts, and stars? Well, if youre Giambattista Valli, you point to legendary 1990s New York club Jackie 60, to Donna Jordan, to Tom Wesselmann, and, above all else, to the #FreeTheNipple movement. Its really all about Free the Nipple! Valli exclaimed backstage after the show, and to some degree, it really was. The very abbreviated frilly hippie frocks the little sister customer (that is, in relation to his big girl Giambattista Valli line and, one supposes, adored child to his big mama couture collection) has come to expect from Giamba were here again, only this time with heart- and star-shaped patches-as-pasties, much in the manner of the emoji carefully placed by your favorite bare-it-all Instagram star. Think an aristocratic Miley Cyrus. Some models had their lanky, pale hair raked through with pastel pink and lilac dye, as if they were members of the Source Family who ran off to Burning Man and never came back. Some wore zebra-striped ankle socks with sequined shoes, or tutu-style skirts with sweatshirts. There may not have been an immediately available narrative through-line, but going out clubbingor freeing the nippleis, after all, chiefly concerned with celebrating a certain joie de vivre. And really, what are those stars and stripes (even when sequined as a bustier or brief) about, if not freedom?$$Giambattista Valli has been tending toward a more sixties silhouette in the past few seasons, and his familiar full-skirted looks made way for a sharper, Youthquakeinspired line today. The Italian designer likes to surround himself with a circle of stylish women that spans generations, and two of his favorites sat in the front row todayLee Radziwill and Bianca Brandolini DAdda. There was an air of romance about the collection that is likely to appeal to both those women, starting with the pretty Art Nouveauinspired florals that were present on everything from balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses to neat, cropped trouser suits. Beyond a penchant for floral prints, intricate embellishments are a Valli sweet spot, and shimmering 3-D petals found their way onto the thigh-grazing miniskirts and mixed-media A-line coats. Naturally, Valli designs with a glamorous social calendar in mind, and finding new ways to invigorate a black-tie dress code is always on his agenda. The silk scarves that topped the bohemian floor-sweeping dresses made for an unexpected alternative to the traditional statement collar. With their eye-catching, glittering soles, the gladiators were a charming and modern re-envisioning of the evening sandal, one thats sure to have legs on the red carpet come spring.$$Lets start with the last look. Because that laser-cut, micro-pleated, satin organza gown goes a long way toward explaining what was going on at the Giles show tonight: Flame-haired Karen Elson emerged, looking to all the world like the genetic clone of Queen Elizabeth I, reanimated to preside over some postapocalyptic England (or, at any rate, a United Kingdom of which Elizabeths thorn-in-the-side, Scotland, is no longer a part). And that was precisely Giles Deacons point. The show was held in the Elizabethan-era Banqueting Room in Whitehall, a place to which the designer would often retire as a student to get away from hustle and bustle and take in the Rubens murals on the ceiling. Hed booked the space for this season a year in advance, and a deep dive into the history of the place led him back to Elizabeth, and provided him the inspiration for his new clothes. In other words, this time out, Deacon was in one of his historical moods. Its a frame of mind that usually results in maximal looks, and on that score this collection did not disappoint. Working with print designer David Holah of Bodymap, Deacon created a print based on a scan of a full-length portrait of Elizabeth I, which found its way onto silhouettes as varied as a leotard-taut bodysuit and a diaphanous caftan. There were also Baroque wallpaper florals and embroideries based on tapestries. But the real drama here was mainly to be found in the collections skirts and sleeves. Deacon didnt stint on the volume, cutting full bell- and balloon-shaped sleeves and frothing his skirts and dresses with parachute hems or underlying layers of tulle. The patterned tights made for a nice complement to all that volume, and they conjured a masculine Renaissance-era look. Then there were the showpieces. Alongside the satin organza gowns worn by Elson and Erin OConnor, Deacon displayed his couturier skills in dresses embellished by an overgrown English gardens worth of tulip-shaped florets and finished other, more plainspoken dresses with tender little frills. As is often the case at Giles, the showboating craft threatened to become the collections whole point, and this season, that threat was particularly acute: The construction of a gown in a brown-toned, understated print could wow you, but the same material, done up into a matter-of-fact silk jumpsuit, underwhelmed. It would have been nice to see Deacon apply more of his attention and artistry to his straightforward looks. The designer was at his best here when he pulled out all the stops, and anytime he did, it was impossible not to be swept up in his storytelling. One sight of Elson in that gown, and all quibbles were forgotten.$$Giorgio Armani continued his 40th-anniversary festivities this afternoon with a press conference and lunch in honor of his new self-titled book of family photographs and personal remembrances. The 81-year-old designer was in a celebratory frame of mind, even making a joke about his nose: I was born with it, he said, pointing to the baby picture hanging behind him onstage. But if the press conference was a moment for reflection, and his recently opened museum is the repository for four decades worth of designs, today's runway show wasn't the walk down memory lane that might've been expected. Instead, Armani chose a color little associated with his work, red, and made it the focus of a collection that was also noteworthy for its lightness, a quality that happens to be synonymous with him. His notes specified shades of flame, lacquer, and geranium, and more often than not he juxtaposed them with navy, icy gray, and white. Coupled with graphic treatments like woven stripes, polka dots, and lozenge embroideries, the palette gave the show a shipshape clarity quite in contrast to the hazy pastels of the Emporio Armani collection he presented last week. Where the Emporio show was awash with pants, here he was interested in walking shorts and abbreviated, full skirts. The trousers he did put on the runway were almost sheer and layered over opaque leggings for a look that was more discreet than seen elsewhere this season. (A see-through skirt or two showed off more than he probably bargained for.) Tailored one-button jackets in that same filmy material were the best pieces in the collection. Though they were rather elaborately stitched with glinting glass beads and silk cord embroidery, they, too, looked airy and weightless, a real feat.$$Tennis-loving cyborgs are taking over! Or rather, they did today on the runway at Giulietta, where designer Sofia Sizzi imagined the sport and its aesthetics, as well as robots, through the lens of Courrges, sending out an army of mod-looking automotons in punchy crimson, cobalt, green, and white. There were sweet, cropped off-the-shoulder tops and culottes, a great T-shirt dress with a tennis skirt, and a kicky blue mini that flashed the crimson of inset pleats. Giulietta has been long distinguished by a certain vintage-loving quirk that carries through to silhouettes, but this season things took a surprising turn toward the body-conscious: strappy bodysuits and hourglasses dresses abounded.  Sizzis tennis references were subtly used, though they were easy to spot if you knew to look for them: bold white stripes seemed to have leapt straight off the courts and onto skirt hems and the legs of pants. The lace of a pair of emerald flares was a riff on tennis balls and nets, as was the collections lovely closing look, a beige evening gown whose organza skirt came studded with big, glossy cabochons. Robots got a nod in geometric jewel and Plexiglass breastplate-like embellishments. But androids arent without their flaws. They have no hearts, for one. And while this collection surely had heart to it, in places it felt a little bloodless. Giuliettas idiosyncracies have served the label well before; heres hoping well see more of them come Fall.$$As more than a thousand people traversed the rush hourchoked West Side Highway and flooded onto Pier 26all dressed to the nines (or maybe the threes or twos, given the skimpiness of a few notable looks)its fair to say that one of the very last things they were expecting was to be immersed in a contemplative experience. Yet this is what they got from Riccardo Tisci on the night he brought his Givenchy show to New York City, coinciding with the 14th anniversary of 9/11. There was no all-out gig from Rihanna and Kanye West (as had been the speculation when performances were mentioned), and no inaugural walk from Caitlyn Jenner, which had been optimistically rumored, given Tiscis strong credentials as fashions first champion of transgender models.  Instead, with the aid of his coconspirator, the artist Marina Abramovic, and the cooperation of a staggering sunset across the Hudson, Tisci made his show into a meditation on the losses of 9/11, and on slowing things down in our heads, perhaps to mourn, but also to remember how lucky we are to be alive. The audiencethe seated professionals and celebrities, and the standing publicwere made to wait and watch for a good hour, absorbing the spectacle of blue sky and white and pink-tinted clouds as Abramovics slow-moving performers, dressed in white shirts and black pants, acted out simple, strenuous, and repetitive ritualsone with a ladder, another with a tree, a third with a faucet gushing water. Stop! Abramovic seemed to be saying. Slow down and feel something! And meanwhile, in the foreground, the nonstop parade of personalities kept coming, and kept on being photographed and Instagrammed.  As far as style is concerned, this was also Tiscis opportunity to revisit and refine the ideas hes been working through for his whole career. This yearin which a Givenchy store opens in New York Cityis Riccardo Tiscis tenth at the house, and there was a serene sense of celebration and coming of age amongst the clothes. It was a collection which spelled out and repeated almost-calligraphic black and white variations of the same sentences: Ivory slip dresses and rouleau-strapped camisoles with lace edges, worn over excellently tailored black pants cut to taper gently over pointed shoes. Supple crepe tuxedo jackets with tails, soft kimono coats, and transparent organdy trenches glimmering with jet embroidery. Many, many body-skimming sparkly silver shifts. Aficionados of Tiscis track record in Paris would also have re-applauded the most spectacular of his couture dressesone with a degrade feather effect, and another with leather patches applied on tulle in the shape of alligator skinwhich had never before been shown on live models (as opposed to showroom dummies). And then there was the face decoration, taken to the nth degree of freakishly beautiful elaboration, in studded golden jewelry, tulle frills, and lace. That calm exposition of skill and taste, which surely grows out of nineties memories, will stay in the minds of everyone who was on Pier 26 tonight. The tragedy of 9/11 can never be overwritten by any fashion showand nor should it bebut at the same time, anyone who condemns fashion for concerning itself with current feelings is wrong, too.$$By now, you know what to expect from a Greg Lauren show. Vintage military fabrics, pieced-together jackets, hip-slung trousers, and hand-distressing are his brands unwavering signatures. Theyre working for him, too: Before taking their seats, a dozen editors and admirers milled around Moynihan Station decked out in his vagabond layers, so there was no confusing which stage was his. Other labels have begun to embrace a sort of deconstructed, nomadic look (Yeezy comes to mind), but Laurens take is less severe than many of his contemporaries. Where other shows might have felt provocative and a bit dark, Laurens outlook was all about moving forward while honoring the past and inspiring people to think about clothes differently. That came through stronger than ever in his Spring presentation, which opened with a captivating performance by 10-year-old dancer Lil'Mini Phoenix, set to Nick Drakes Way to Blue. I saw her dance a couple months ago and knew I wanted her to open my show, Lauren said backstage. Shes an example of this next generation of strong females who are saying, Dont tell me what I should be or aspire to. I really believe women are leading the way in creativity, leadership, artevery discipline. Theyre breaking boundaries, changing stereotypes. How did that sentiment translate into the clothes? Laurens women always look powerful in their army drabs and rumpled suits, and there were plenty of those here. But an expanded evening range gave the designer the chance to inject a little more sex appeal: An ivory body-skimming silk gown looked 90s-era minimal at first, but there were billowing swaths of parachute fabric spliced into the back. I wanted there to be flow, he explained. There were also subtle dance references, like a champagne dress with hand-placed strips of silk on the bodice, which mimicked the casual but intentional way a dancer laces up her pointe shoes. The final look was Laurens most experiential to date: The halter neckline of a fluid jet-black silk dress was sculpted, cast in resin, and then plated with gunmetal. He described it as part relic, part liquid metal, but on a simple, beautiful silhouette. It would make an interesting red carpet choice, but our moneys also on the silk lounge pants and robe coat, which offered a softer spin on the tuxedo.$$The incoming march of a new generation in Italy has begun, and the fashion world finds itself standing back spectating on the sudden arrival of a multicolored, sparkly, life-affirming parade. Alessandro Michele is in the spotlight as the Pied Piper of changea risk-taker and revolutionary who has not so much wiped the slate clean at Gucci as doodled all over it, colored it in, stuck sequins on it, and tied it up with a grosgrain bow. His Spring lineup was a very much amplified, filled-in, decorated, and dazzling accessorized extension of the girly, geeky, vintage-like collection that he launched last season in the incongruously dark nightclubby surroundings of the show space the company had been using since the 90s, when Tom Ford was grooving the disco 70s at the brand. As Michele said backstage, surrounded by a visual kaleidoscope of glittery, flower-embroidered satin, chiffon, Lurex knits, brocades, and trimmings, Its a big trip! Of course I am interested in personal style and quirkiness. There are things here that look vintage, but dont really exist as vintageits the illusion of it. Im not nostalgic! Id like to shake it up again. Michele is having none of the slick Gucci aesthetic that descended down through the tenure of his predecessor and former boss, Frida Giannini. This time, he led his army of Gucci girls into the open air and constructed an aristo-domestic set, with a printed carpet against the backdrop of a disused train depota plot of broken-down, old industrial Milan which, if we are to be romantic about it, seemed something like a metaphor for Italian regeneration.  What Michele is doing is certainly very Italian, in its references, which (if we are to be geeky about history) run the gamut from Missonis Lurex knits to Roberta di Camerino to Walter Albini and generally use the wonderful era of expressively luxe postwar dressmaking fabrics as a playground. Michele said he has been thinking about the Renaissance and the 1970sboth great eras for Italy in their own waysbut that his whole point is to express personality and emotion through his clothes. Fashion is close to tenderness, he declared, apologizing for his English. I havent slept for two days!  No wonder. Apart from his sweeping in of a whole new aesthetic, the vast variety of components in the collection must have kept Michele and his teamsand the shoe, bag, hat, eyewear, and trimmings communities of Italyworking around the clock for months. The results are mesmerizing close-up: Gucci loafers that get pearl-studded heels, damask slip-ons with ridged soccer soles, green boots with flared heels and ghillie laces in rococo blue satin, a pair of Mary Janes with studs made of bullet casings. Thats just for starters. If Gucci manages to supply even a fraction of all this stuff to its stores worldwide, it could have riotous demands on its hands.$$The heritage of Guy Laroche reads blurry at best in our collective consciousness, so when London-based designer Adam Andrascik took the reins of the storied house earlier this year, it was his turn to write a new set of rules. From that first outing, it was already clear his vision dramatically overstepped the Parisienne tropes of Monsieur Laroches couture past, driving a more youthful, urban sensibility that returned in his second collection for Spring.  Stretching a tall tale of tropical dystopia to describe his sophomore effort, Central Saint Martinstrained Andrascik showed an upbeat cross-section of ladylike daywear collaged with wartime references, such as the khaki jacquards traced with palm fronds that occasionally returned as mirrored appliqus for evening. Swinging between touches of military detailing and ultra-feminine froufrou, his barely there shirting, off-the-shoulder jackets, and miniskirts benefited from the strictness he employed via brass button symmetry, yet faltered into unnecessary complication when ruching and knotted hemlines took center stage.  Among the complex slice-and-dice of dvor jacquards and muddy striped separates, Andrasciks talent with a biker jacket rose once again to the fore, with that Laroche staple energized in multiple permutations today. In leather, it featured a daring cutout shoulder and chain details (perhaps a sultry choice for Jada Pinkett Smith, who sat front row in Falls gold-dipped sweaterdress), yet for Andrascik it seems the more streamlined, the better. Cases in point: a Perfecto lapel folding down a straight, double-collar coatdress and a series of scooped-back shirts. They channeled that same millennial grunge that his double-waistband denim captured in spades.$$The timing couldnt have been better. Just as the models streamed out together for Haider Ackermanns finale, the clouds broke outside the Palais de Chaillot and sunshine poured in through the giant Eiffel Towerfacing windows, lighting up a parade of gorgeous pastel panne velvet. Ackermann has a reputation as Pariss broodiest artiste, known for a dark, moody palette and a penchant for draping that sometimes errs on the droopy side. He was up to something a bit different today, and it started with his dreamily hued velvetin lemon yellow, blush pink, pale blue, and lilacwith punk-but-pretty mohawks to match. Weve seen color play a starring role at other shows this week, notably Dries Van Noten and Lanvin, but here it was an authentic surprise. Its likely nobody walked in wanting a pair of green chartreuse satin pants with a dusty pink and faded blue waistband, but some of us walked out that way.  The other virtue of this collection was its diversity. Jacket-wise, Ackermann put a lot of options on the runway, from shrunken leather motos to languid mens dressing gowns to a double-breasted blazer trim enough to tuck into trousers. Pant styles, meanwhile, ranged from Friday night at the club (black leathers) to Sunday morning at Les Puces (frayed and patched cargos). Only laser-cut leggings stood out as a mistake in a lineup that was otherwise pretty free of them. The lacy pantyhose peeking out from under waistbands was a styling effect, strictly runway only. Dresses werent the focus, but the ones he did show scored high on the wearability meter, especially a bias-cut black velvet number worn with a matching jacket.$$Everything old is new again at Halston Heritage. For Pre-Fall an archival feather hat designed by the late, legendary Roy Frowick set the gears turning, and for Spring it was a vintage Halston silk scarf in a macro orchid print that inspired creative director Marie Mazelis. At todays preview she also namechecked Cuba, specifically referring to the candy-colored, crumbling splendor captured in photographer Robert Polidoris images of Havana. The jetsetting appeal of recent seasonsinspirations have lately included Halstons jaunts to China and Acapulcohas done plenty to increase the glamour quotient at the brand, and it did so here, too, if subtly. That orchid scarf led to larger-than-life prints (Halston was known to spend around six figures a year to keep his studio full of his favorite blooms), which were used on blouses and diaphanous caftans. The Polidori pictures informed Mazeliss palette of aquamarine, coral, and tangerine.  Movement was central here, whether in the accordion-pleated chiffon overlay that topped one simple sheath, or the fistfuls of jangling paillettes on the shoulders of another. At times it felt like the HH team stuck too literally to the shapes of Halstons seventies salad days with their one-shouldered frocks, plunging halter dresses, and wide-leg glamour-puss jumpsuits. Next season it might be worth adding a bit of that eras gleeful hedonism into the mix.$$The woman for whom Hellessy is designed does not wear short shorts, said Sylvie Millstein during the presentation of her latest collection, and she certainly wont have to. Long, fluid gowns in striped cotton-linen and ochre-colored silk commingled with easy, blush-toned pajama suiting and tuxedo-tailed strapless bodices worn over wide-leg trousers, promoting a different kind of cool entirely. An off-the-shoulder blouse with a thick black band across the chest and creamy white poet sleeves gathered at the cuffs, a light silk trench in that same shade of ochre boasting a literal twist of fabric at the back: It was a vision of summer in the city where the frayed hems come on the edges of a boxy, tailored T-shirt-style topnot your cutoffs.  The presentation took place in Chelsea at Lori Bookstein Fine Art, where fate would have it that the current showHiroyuki Hamada: Paintings, opening September 10served as a kind of underlining to Millsteins aesthetic philosophy: an artful approach to a certain elegant restraint. Its about not doing too much, said the designer, who looked to colors found in a city summer and primarily relied on all-natural fibers (linen, cotton, silkand really, what more do you need in the sultriest of seasons?). She found her inspiration in the rooftop parties that absorb New Yorkers social lives from June through September, with all of the skylines sparkle (here seen in a V-neck cocktail-ready cotton lam shift, its Art Deco silhouette echoing the era of some of Manhattans most lauded skyscrapers) and upward thrust (represented by the bold vertical stripe of a column dress and mid-calf-length extended pajama shirt tunic) implied therein.$$Fashion history is Hwan Heos obsession. The Korean designer has a quite nerdy approach, considering his almost scholarly zeal in referencing a precise fashion decade for each collection: I call it the Critique Collection Project because the process is close to a research or a study, he said during a presentation of his Spring lineup. Every Critique Collection is numbered, like chapters in a fashion history book. He has already reached Critique Collection Project n.9, which was dedicated to the Great Depression. Not a very lighthearted subject, but the designer was undeterred. He found a picture from the 30s of a little girl working in a factory, imagining her dreaming of being free and playful instead of having to face such a harsh reality. Hence a collection where the severe tailoring of masculine workwear (in pursuit of historical truth, real cutting patterns of that era were used as references) was softened by the use of fun, feminine colors. Ribbons and strings added a gentle yet playful touch, allowing the outfits to be transformed in a constellation of diverse silhouettes, following the personal mood of the wearer. In another literal nod to the prohibitions of that time, not a bit of fabric was wasted. Instead of trimming the excess material, the ingenious Hwan Heo made it into a multitude of inventive shapes, leaving the ends loose and un-hemmed. Case in point was a voluminous coat in black-and-white houndstooth jacquard with an orange belt; apparently it was cut as a geometric square, but on closer inspection it revealed hidden wings made from uncut fabric, folding and cascading on the sides for a graceful ruffled effect.$$Trying to describe Herms is an exquisite form of torture to a non-French person. Somehow, the foreign tongue (I mean English) simply cannot find words to explain the ingeniously crafted, superfine fabrics and leather it uses without sounding pretentious (a well-known Anglophone phobia). Even worse, the values of the house are so restrained and so coded as to be next to undetectable to the uninitiated. Being in on them involves far more than being alert to the occasional H logo on top of a bag strap, or congratulating oneself for recognizing that Herms silk scarves are being incorporated into clothing, as Nadge Vanhee-Cybulski did (again) this season.  In a nutshell, Herms is the essence of the cultivated, inbred French point of view that if you have wealth, it must be spent so that it doesnt show except to those of your class. And by the way, a woman must never blunder by trying to be sexy, appear to wear makeup, or have done hair. Foreign women are half-blind to all these nuances, as they run counter to most of our instincts, yet still we are obsessed with cracking the secret codes. Both Kris Jenner and Janet Jackson are apparently amongst the intrigued: They were onhand at the show to view how Vanhee-Cybulski would set out the Herms principles for Spring.  She did it with a simplified sequence of blue-black tailoring and grid-patterned black-on-cream tops and pants, and mustard-color dresses in cotton and leather, accessorized with large quartz and clear resin cuffs. Something of Vanhee-Cybulskis background as a former design director for The Row figures in here: Shes brought a sense of relaxed city-sportiness to the picture, showing Herms trainers with many looks and dialing back on the horsey heritage for the moment. Its not showy fashion that is being sold here; more a carefully calibrated sense of a lifestyle which consciously rises above trendiness. For those who want to belong to it, the quality of the materials will be explained in the ritual of buying at Herms, where the quiet mystique of all this Frenchness is fully laid out.$$Today was the 30th anniversary of Herv Lger, and show-going lovers of the label shuffled in wearing none other than the houses perennial frock: the bandage dress. The attire was predictable, but creative officer Lubov Azria threw onlookers for a loop when it came to the runway: There wasnt a bandage dress in sight. We were thinking, How do we evolve this line on the runway, where we didnt do one bandage technique?  said Azria backstage. Sure, the decision not to include the popular, body-skimming piece synonymous with the house seemed risky, but Azria managed to keep the DNA of Herv Lger alive in other ways. First, from afar, many of the minidresses looked like bandage dresses and moved like bandage dresses (they barely moved at all). Those features were enough to keep the die-hard lovers of the staple happy. For instance, there were still those hourglass-hugging silhouettes, this time seen in jacquard fit-and-flare frocks, which came in black and cream with crisscross netting dipping down into the dcolletage. But Azria was also able to infuse some new techniques, like floral appliqus on tank dresses, which nicely traced the body to emphasize the waist. There were also some woven cords on a sleeveless dress, slightly curved for a slenderizing trompe l'oeil effect.  But it was Azrias introduction of trousers on the catwalk (before, she had only showed leggings) which provided a true dose of cool. Jacquard pants were striped or patterned, flaring out at the kneean effect that seemingly elongated the legsor were woven into slouchy or fitted jumpsuits. The new direction still contained that bold va va voom factor of a bandage dress, but it wasn't as forwardand with it, Azria could potentially gain a new set of fans.$$To witness a designer evolve, improve, and flourish is one of the greatest pleasures of regular show attendance. Today Holly Fulton hit that career-narrative uplift with a collection that put away some of the childish (albeit diverting) tics she had previously favored for a focused yet imaginatively soaring kaleidoscope of clothing. Her inspiration was the artist Eileen Agara name shamefully new to this reviewerwho collaged repetitive patterns taken from nature. Hence the calligraphic ruffles on the starfish-studded opening dresses that echoed the languidly spiraling tail of a seahorse. Or the injection-molded abstract floral silicon appliqus and glinting Swarovski, protoChaos Theory myriads that danced across these carefully proportioned silhouettes. Fultons feel for harmonic color combinations was in tune, and she paid rewarding diligence to often-overlooked categories that included an exactly precise denim and chambray section. Previously, Fulton was lovable for the walk-of-shame, tousled fiercenessvery Londonthat so often inflected itself in her collections. Today that was eclipsed by unapologetic virtuosity. Backstage Fulton said: We were trying to use repetition to create cohesion that reflected the almost psychedelic eccentricity of Agar. My favorite quote from her is Ive enjoyed life and it shows through, like a transparent skirtshe basically spent many of her latter years being semi-naked in translucent garmentsand we tried to incorporate that idea of something strong, feminine, and light.$$It was all about childhood in the Caribbean. And growing up around uniforms. We had such high education, and we couldnt do anything with ithigh education and low living quarters. So it was about cutting up and altering that school uniform, as we did.  Shayne Oliver was wearing a long, striped knitted column dress as he gave his articulate coda to Hood By Airs radically chopped-up schoolyard collection, after a show to which the notes had been printed on a detention card registering many misdemeanors. A journalist earnestly asked Oliver for his position on gender-neutral clothes, as there had been equal numbers of men and women wearing spliced and suspended skirts and dresses on the runway. Which is meant for which? To Oliver, thats hardly a burning issue anymore. At this point, he replied, patiently, we are wearing Hood By Air, just as part of the family. Its odd how things come around. There was a fashion movement in the 90s called deconstructionism, which mainly came from then-marginalized and poor young designers who bonded in basements in Antwerp and London. In some ways, Hood By Air is their 21st-century successor, working to take apart conventional garments, shrinking the components, and making something new and unrecognizable out of them, using zippers and the language of bondage paraphernalia. Still, Hood By Airs collective way of working is different, and in many ways more successfully social revolutionary than those who went before, many of whom eventually became absorbed into the commercial style of mainstream minimalism. For one thing, HBAs expression is far more exuberantly sexual, fun, and democratic than the intellectually exclusive 90s crew. For another, the HBA ethos is genuinely at the leading edge of a social change that has swept through legislation this year, in ways former generations never have dreamed would come to pass. And for a third: Hood By Air is a brand that actually sells. It doesnt look like highfalutin fashion, butand this would never have happened before eitherits welcomed as part of Fashion Week, recognized as a now-unmissable draw for international buyers and press. One up for the credibility of New York fashion.$$We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. Thus begins Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, gonzo maestro Hunter S. Thompsons ever-entertaining account of how not to be a reliable journalist, and the source material for this evenings almost-as-diverting House of Holland show. Strictly, Holland was inspired by the labor-of-love Johnny Depp flick from 1998. So the sometimes jeweled, sometimes embroidered insects that oozed down his clothes were approximations of the hallucinatory special effects mustered for that production, while the bulging ostrich feather shoes and appliqus were nods to the abysmal 70s motel decor Depps Thompson bugged out on in the movie.  The first look featured a crazily patched field jacket on a model styled to approximate Thompson himself, and the bucket hats that ran through the collection were more hat-tips to the reprobate author. Head-fry colorful cactus-print shirtdresses, nerd-chic pulled-high sports socks, queasy abstract jacquards and you-really-shouldn't-mix-those color combinations including lime green and orange added to the maximalist overdose. Thompson and Holland, although separated by decades and disciplines, made for intoxicating bedfellows.$$If you can remember them afterwards, British music festivals can often be wonderful. Trouble is, they are almost always extremely wet: Forget Burning Man, think Soaked Everyone. Today Alasdhair Willis evoked these dubious delights by creating a runway of trodden mud on which he relived the three stages of typical Brit Festival experience via the medium of clothes. First, optimistic anticipation: In they bounded, wearing ripstop fishtail parkas in sunny dgrad pastels under a deludedly light layer of deconstructed outerwear. This included a powerful remix of the trucker jacket in shades of olive and camo. The shoes, a key category for Hunter, included an interesting hybrid of desert boot and the specially-made Vibram sole used on the labels heaviest-duty Wellingtonhere rendered in pastel panels for fashion consumption. Next, postinevitable downpour, came adaptation: Rubberized coats peppered with drawstring ringlets and botanical flecked semitransparent parkas wreathed in guy rope ribbons were meant, said Willis, to give the impression they had been hastily assembled to fend off the rain. Wellingtons appeared, in more dgrad pastel. Camo parkas in crunchy-to-the-touch treated nylon obscured, rather unfortunately, a fine section of colorful patched gingham shirting. By the end, sheer abandon had set in: Its still raining, but Hell Yeah. A medley of oversized baseball jackets-meet-ponchos came variously peppered with patches (including the Beatles Yellow Submarine) or with suspended fringes of more ribboning. Hunters metamorphosis from farmers favorite to front row draw (Salma Hayek and Luke Evans were among the attendees today) began when Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, and other It Brits started wearing the companys Wellingtons at Glastonbury a decade or so ago. So riffing on that transformative moment seems a fair way to advance Williss ambition to further Hunter as a youthful lifestyle brand. Backstage he recalled his own first festival: Glastonbury, 1985. I saw Echo & the Bunnymen. And it didnt rain! Some guys have all the luck.$$Since debuting his first collection for ICB earlier this year, Makoto Takada has carefully cultivated the seeds planted by his predecessor, Prabal Gurung. As he settles in for his third season as design director, Takada is revealing a bit more of his own playful sensibility while still filtering it through the brands working-woman narrative.  The starting point for the collection was the photography of Vivian Maier, a Chicago nanny who found success posthumously when undeveloped rolls of film, shot by her in the 50s through the 70s, were discovered and published. But instead of riffing on the retro styles seen in her work, Takada translated the inspiration into a witty exploration of hidden talent and secret fulfillment. Takada liked the idea that Maier, who toiled undiscovered for decades, didnt need anyones affirmation to value herself. So sprinkled through the collection are tiny surprises that only the wearer might notice: a structured blazer pleated so that, in motion, a flash of nude crepe is revealed; a pinstripe constructed from raffia; and black wool trousers with a sheer grid, created using dvor, which revealed a minuscule square of skin. For the woman who buys this, its something she can enjoy just for herself, said Takada. Shirting remains the brands bread and butter, and this seasons pice de rsistance, according to Takada, is a whimsical take on the classic: a blue oxford shirt with a fountain of delicate feathers sprouting from the chest. The feathers had been carefully hand-stitched in India so that they would hover over the fabric like a little cloud. I had this idea of someone who works in the corporate world showing up in this shirtits in the dress code, but also not in the dress code, said Takada. Its that rebellion and irony. It reminds me of how Vivian took photos of regular people, but there was always a narrative.$$Iceberg has seen a long list of designers come and go over the years. Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Marc Jacobs, the Dsquared2 brothers, and Giambattista Valli have all held the top post. Alexis Martial was the most recent recruit until he graduated to Carven earlier this year. Now Arthur Arbesser, who launched his own label a few seasons ago, has assumed the role, and its a sign of his buzz factor, and Milans growing enthusiasm for nurturing local talent, that the turnout in the front row was the best it has been at Iceberg in recent memory. I feel quite honored and happy to be here, Arbesser said backstage, but at the same time I feel [the line] needs a good injection of fun and energy. And a clear message. He certainly brought zest to the endeavor this afternoon, embracing the brands heritage in knits and not skimping on color or pattern either. The bonkers work of the Italian artist Enrico Baj was a jumping-off point, informing the bold print on a silk dress and the plastic badges pinned to the chest of some pieces, creating a loose, sort of military vibe. But the knits are what really resonated. With their preppy-psychedelic sensibility and body-conscious fit, theyll be catnip for the street style posse. Theyll also be a pleasure to wear, which will make them attractive to more restrained types, too. It will be interesting to see what Arbesser does for Fall, when he can really have a go at sweater dressing. We expect to see an even bigger crowd at round two.$$In the center of Iris van Herpens venue today, lying flat on a plinth, was the actress Gwendoline Christie. The Game of Thrones star remained there motionless for the whole show, even as the trio of animatronic trees surrounding her began to move, as if they were weaving the soft, fishnet-like dress that spread out in a circle around her. Quaquaversal is the name Van Herpen gave her new collection: It means going off in all directions, and backstage she said thats how she approaches her work, collaborating with scientists, artists, biologists, and now performers.  Van Herpen is one of contemporary fashions few true conceptual thinkers, one for whom process is as integral as the finished product. Indeed, like Hussein Chalayan this season with his disintegrating dresses, she asked us to reconsider the very notion of a finished product with her growing one. Beyond the performance piece, there was much of interest on Van Herpens runway, where the designer worked hard to combine craftsmanship and technology. She started with sportswear: skirts, tops, a leanly cut little dress. It was normal stuff but for the laser-cutting and hand-weaving. The silhouettes were pure and simple so the materials could shine, and shine they did on crystal-studded chain-link dresses of the Paco Rabanne variety. Only here the chain wasnt chain at all, but a clear synthetic material that made the crystals look as if they were floating without a tether. The most exceptional work came toward the end of the show on a pair of looks as delicate as a fine tracery, with so much negative space they were more not there than there. Laser-cut fishnet gowns appeared to have been made from a weightless silvery metal. With their futuristic aspects, these pieces of Van Herpens will be fitting for Christie when she hits the red carpet for her two holiday blockbusters: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 and Star Wars: Episode VII. This relationship could be very good for both of them.$$She will always be a rock chick at heart, but its clear that the Iro girl is going placesshe has a real job now, for one, and so does her guy, so they need more daywear options to make it all work. Of course, theyre most likely to be in a field where slim-cut cropped leather trousers and destroy-chic jeans are the norm. When not worn with basic fine-gauge cotton tanks, these might be paired with a breezy popover with openwork details or a multicolored pink print; only the most daringor laid-backwill don the striped shirts with deliberate mothy perforations during office hours. Other pieces, especially the jackets, will go just about everywhere: These included a salt and pepper tweed number with frayed edges, and textured wrap jackets in khaki, ecru, and black, with or without sleeves, cinched by an obi-inspired belt. (For him, spring heralds slim-cut suits, too). Since its inception, Iros biggest star has been the leather bomber, in iterations with cool names like the Ashville, the Zefir, and the Jone. The gangs still all here in neutral colors, although theyre being upstaged by offerings in silver, gold, and saffron that, with a tunic or printed maxi dress swapped in, move easily from the office to a holiday by the beach. Speaking of city and shore, an ever expanding repertoire of flats presented a number of hybrid ideas, from a pointy boot-meets-slide style to a lace-up-as-thong; rounding out the offering were gladiator styles and tennis shoes, this season with an iridescent finish.$$Isa Arfen collections never lack for charm. This season, though, designer Serafina Sama laid it on even thicker than usual. Taking her cues from vintage photos of Balinese women, 70s-era exoticism, and rave culture in the 90s, Sama conjured a rather ladylike trip to the tropicsone of the acid variety, perhaps. Sama wasnt particularly literal with her references. The sarong-style wrapping and tops, skirts, and dresses layered with ruffles were one type of nod to Indonesia; the collections copious black-and-white check, it turned out, was another. (Apparently checked textiles are popular in Bali; who knew?) The 70s homage was more abstract, reflected in the airy, hothouse-appropriate shapes of button-downs, coats, and jackets, and in the emphasis on olive drab in the palette. Samas decision to steer away from styles plainly associated with the 70s was cannythere have been umpteen versions of the safari jacket since that legendary collection by YSL, but none like Samas, which came A-line shaped and embellished with graphic grosgrain appliqu. Nor were there any flares here, or, for that matter, any Isa Arfensignature culottes. Samas trouser message this season was crystal clear: capris, capris, capris. Rave culture, meanwhile, was the most abstracted reference of all. Mainly, it contributed to the mix of, as Sama put it, poisonous colors in stripes and a silk-screened tropical floral print. So far, so charming, but the collections real grace notes were to be found in its fabrications, an Isa Arfen specialty. The PVC-coated linen of a printed kimono coat was one standout; another was the crispy cotton blend of the checks. Sama also made a concerted effort to use materials that looked crushed or crumpled, as though theyd been packed into a suitcase. That choice helped to give this rather dressy collection its atmosphere of informality. Ditto the way Sama layered her ruffles all askew. Ditto, too, the fact that this collection, as a whole, came off deeply impractical. Individual pieces could easily be worked into a womans everyday wardrobe, but they seemed aimed more at the woman for whom every day is an adventure. A charmed life, to be sure.$$Isabel Marant pulled together a thumping 80s hip-hop soundtrack for her show today, even though the influences on her new collection skewed more North India than South Bronx. The Parisian designer has made a name for herself by filtering that elusive French girl cool through a distinctly global lens: She was a seasoned traveler from an early age, thanks to her bohemian upbringing, and has a knack for cherry-picking, and then deftly reconfiguring, dress codes and traditions from all four corners of the planet. For Spring, Marants divining stick led her to the rich, colorful textiles of Rajasthan. Its a place the designer has visited for inspiration in the past, but given the free-spirited, eccentric 70s moods that seems to be lingering in the air on the runways, that milieu still feels relevant. That being said, the silhouettes recalled the rounded, billowy shapes of the 80s overall. Style-conscious festival girls who have spent the summer in breezy, vintage-inspired peasant blouses will be swapping out their skinny jeans for harem pants come spring if Marant has her way. The MC Hammer favorite isnt exactly the easiest look to pull off, but in this case the styling was right: Layered up with sequined leggings and elevated with Gorky-style heels, the look took on a new vibe. What with all the sparkling textiles that have been around in the collections, somehow a Lurex gold jumpsuit gathered at the ankle, rolled down to the waist, and worn with a lightweight sweater felt right for now. The global nomad hand of the clothes might have been familiar territory for Marant, but its still likely to give her fans a reason to revisit her store.$$The pulsing strains of Die Antwoord reverberated through Issas London show space today, the first indication that creative director Jamie OHare was looking at his nature girl through a somewhat twisted lens for Spring, only his second runway outing for the label. Name-checking films like District 9 and Tron backstage, he described the blown-up details lavished across cocktail dresses and Resort separates as both futuristic and organican altogether chilly segue for a brand built on graphic eveningwear, yet one he tempers with swathes of delicate texture and shine. A slew of opening looks paired flat planes of white silk crepe against an encrusted latticework of metallic embroidery, transforming the designers abstract research of stem cell structures into glistening cocktail fare. Later, body-con knits came tiered in black and white bands of lacing and plastic eyelets, creating eye-catching frills and multilayered contours that hugged in all the right places. Balancing that stricter offering, flattering tank dresses fell into handkerchief hems that matched the delicate butterfly effect of lace jersey caftans in cerulean and optic white fractalstheir swirling, architectural prints later morphing into an unfortunate trippy tie-dye that slowed the momentum of an otherwise appealing minimalist streak. It preceded the monotony of slinky wrap dresses that followeddraped concoctions in sheer self-stripe silk, space doughnut prints, and bands of aquarelles that will slip easily into the summer party circuit, though with little fanfare. Pieces like Lily Donaldsons floor-length gown, however (its circuit of jacquard trailed with white lozenges), spoke a little louder of Issas raison dtre: no-nonsense glamour with a bold, feminine allure.$$Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have been experiencing a runway renaissance of late. One place you wont find a straightforward take on the house signature, though, is at Issey Miyake itself: At the brands show, designer Yoshiyuki Miyamae continued to test the horizons of what a pleat can be and do, introducing a new baked stretch technique that molds pleats into the body of a fabric. The most compelling looks in the collection were the ones that featured wavy baked stretch pleats, with contrasting colors printed into the curves; as the sculptural garments moved, they had a spring action, a little like that of a Slinky. The motion was surprising but subtleyou could easily imagine wearing these pieces. The looks with the most instantaneous appeal, however, were the bright, color-blocked ones punctuated with touches of fringe. Miyamae and his team had a tropical theme going here, witnessed in the collections palette, but the raffia textures of the fringed pieces nicely underlined the hothouse atmosphere. There were also net tops with a similarly earthy charman unusual tone for Miyake, a house that hews to a synthetic aesthetic as a rule, but a welcome addition to the brand vocabulary. Pleats remain the star at Issey Miyake, but there are new supporting players.$$The vintage Levis revival currently under way has got premium denim-makers in a bit of a pickle. Do you try to propose an alternative look or offer new jeans that accord with the vintage vibe? J Brand did a bit of both this season, in a collection of denim and ready-to-wear that emphasized time-tested silhouettes. Most of the innovation was in the materials: Head of design Mary Bruno did yeomans work developing ultra-lightweight denims and dyeing and distressing  gossamer cotton-linen blends to look like denim, such that J Brand may indeed find itself with a monopoly on jeans suitable for the dog days of summer. Brunos other key proposals were to offer a trouser jean, which looked particularly natty in optical white, and indigo-dyed stretch denim made in vaguely 70s-ish swimwear shapes. She wasnt trying to reset anyones denim agenda here; this collection was more about proposing solutions for women who want to keep wearing the denim they already like when it gets really hot. Thats enough to make a market, not so much to make news.$$You could call it London Fashion Weeks soft launch. J. JS LeeJackie Lee to her friendshas the advantage of showing first on the London calendar. She is South Korean and emerged from Central Saint Martins M.A. course in 2010the minimalist yearwith a bumper crop of alumni who founded their own businesses in London: Simone Rocha, Thomas Tait, and Matthew Harding of Palmer//Harding were all in the same class, taught by the late legendary professor Louise Wilson. Lee has taken her collection away from its beginnings in rather structured tailoring in neutral colors toward something more fluid and airy, withsurprise!pops of color, bold stripes, and a few dappled black-and-white prints. The result: a pleasantly breezy wardrobe that could translate well as daily wear in those cities that are baking in high summernot London, particularlybut then again, Lee is from Seoul.$$The J. Mendel customer has long been a certain type of Madison Avenue grande dame, one who comes for the furs from the incomparable atelier and sticks around for the romantic frocks to tuck under them. But the designers recent red carpet successes with a younger crowdTaylor Swift, Maria Sharapova, and the Sports Illustrated model Hannah Davis among themhave opened up a new demographic, one just as attuned to major red carpet moments as self-styled Instagram snaps. And who can blame Giles Mendel for wanting to be there for both? The day looks he had designed for Spring seemed crafted with this crew in mind, with urban-minded accents such as graphic prints, grommets, straps, and slits. Asymmetrical micro-pleated skirts were either made micro-length or cut to the ankle, paired with roomy tunics or boxy tees. In what felt like a more-is-more take on what the kids are wearing, bandeau tops were paired with snakeskin wrap skirts or light-as-air organza ballroom styles that, while masterfully renderedThe pleats open up and blossom like petals, said Mendel, and they didultimately missed the mark. (Skin may be in, and snakeskin, too, but the kids who love you for old-school romance wont necessarily love you for their going-out-clubbing looks.) As the glamour level rose, things loosened up. A narrow micro-pleated column dress with a built-in bandeau had massive appeal on and off the hanger, while a black-and-white abstract-print silk chiffon gown with cutout bodice was its own wind machine, moving with extreme graceit could be just the thing for next awards season. A creamy textured silk crepe anorak patterned with graphic black abstractions inspired by Japanese woodblock prints hit just the right note: charmingly sporty, even when paired with a matching intarsia cropped mink that Mendel explained was intended to disappear into the pattern when popped on top. And as for those furs, a pair of long, vividly patterned yagasuri intarsia mink vests For the plane? Mendel said with a winkwill prove just the thing to tide over the J. Mendel client, old and new, until fall, when the big coats come out.$$For a brand in times of transition, figuring out the best way to trigger the reset button is often the most pressing challenge. Thats perhaps why, this season, J.Crew was going back to its roots, or, as president and executive creative director Jenna Lyons put it, Pulling from the things that feel undeniably like us. Gingham, nautical stripes, tomboy favorites such as the shrunken military jacket: Its easy to distinguish the moving parts to the J.Crew look, one that Lyons herself has made so appealing to women the world over in the last decade. All those classics made an appearance in the presentation today, only often they were tweaked in subtle ways. One sun-bleached menswear-inspired plaid shirt was paired with a matching bias-cut skirt that was covered in glittering sequins, while another was recast as an off-the-shoulder peasant blousewhat is fast becoming the answer to the crisp white button-down. The brands knack for preppy print-on-print combos came through particularly well in a graphic blue-on-blue gingham shirt and pants ensemble. With new womenswear designer Somsack Sikhounmuong set to make his official debut next season, it will be interesting to see which way those familiar J.Crewisms will go.$$Gargantuan 80s leg-of-mutton sleeves. Galactic knitted pantsuits. Ruched body-con dresses. Keith HaringcumVivienne Westwood squiggle prints. Gold metal chokers. Square-toed metallic spike heels of the kind that havent been seen since the 90s. Lets put it this way: There is a lot to process at J.W.Anderson. A womans odyssey was what Jonathan Anderson was calling it backstage. The idea that if you took a date in time and sliced it through and looked at what everyone was doing at that timewould it mean anything? And would it matter if it didnt? But lets shelve the intellectual parsing of that complicated quote for a moment. Perhaps only Anderson knows what it means, and it doesnt matter if we never do. But to state it plainly from another angle, the thing about Anderson, at this very moment, is that he is someone possessed of the ability to jumble together unexpected ideas, and make a new sentence of them. It is the sentence that reads: You didnt know you wanted this beforebut now you will! That, of course, is the essence of fashionsomething that makes you feel a bit queasy and puzzled for a few seconds, but then, just as quickly shoots into the bloodstream as desire. Jonathan Anderson classifies as an experimental avant-garde designer in that sense, a leader. But at another just as crucial level, hes a clear-headed maker of product. Break down this collection, and its full of items to take away just as they are: many ribbed knits as tunics and pants, neat pantsuits in compact jersey, fluid printed midi skirts, a frill-fronted A-line dress, and a tracksuit covered in net. Then, bags, worn two at a time, cross-body, like panniers. But back to what the man said: A clue was in the audioa mix of Fran Lebowitzs words about Andy Warhol and his manipulation of fame, and Rihannas Only Girl (In the World). I was watching Martin Scorseses documentary about Fran Lebowitz and liked what she said, her commentary on a moment. She spoke about creativity. What does it mean? Maybe it only means something to me, said Anderson. Then he paused and shrugged, as if something Lebowitz said chimed with him on the level of being a designer in an industry that is constantly running at high speed and, of course, whose work is instantly exposed at every turn. Obviously, he said, Theres always another show. Not that he should worry about that today: This was a moment that is certain to keep people talkingand buying their Spring trophies for plenty of time to come.$$A gigantic red ball of fabric was pushed across an open expanse of concrete floor by a tiny barefoot child in a mans white shirt. Models, walking in ones and twos, followed him, dressed in fractured tailored pieces, sliced half-jackets in navy and gray cloth dresses, overlaid and underlaid with white shirts cut on the diagonal or worn back-to-front and tied on with cotton tape. Halfway through the show, to add to the oddness, the designer himself appeared, seemingly an adult version of the boy, leading a white horse across the stage in an interlude before more models came on. What was this? A surreal symbolic dream or a fashion nightmare where clothes are to be bought in asymmetrical fractions? Backstage, Simon Porte Jacquemus, who recently won an LVMH Prize in its young designer competition, tried to explain the state of mind he was in when he plotted this oddly trancelike and unsettling parade. His emotions seemed raw and vulnerable. The collection was called Le Nez Rouge, he said, because he had been sick, afflicted with a red nose and personal troubles as he was designing. You know, my collections are normally about the South of France and the beach and happy things? Well, now the Jacquemus girl is not smiling, he said. Without spelling out what had happened, he added, My friends, my family knows. It is harsh to call judgment on a very young designer who is clearly under stressas are they allas he tries to make his way, with feeling, in the hard world of fashion commerce. Though his narrative, held in a huge arena of a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris, didnt quite hold up in the space, it didnt obfuscate everything Jacquemus has going for him. Backstage, his navy pants, long narrow skirts, and white shirts looked crisply cut and as attractive as they always do in stores.$$With his recent turn toward tailoring and a more minimalist point of view, its easy to forget that Jason Wu got his start as a dressmaker. This season, he seemed eager to remind us of his origins. Glamour was the one-word description his show notes proffered. The first look out was a trenchcoat, sure, but its edges were softly frayed and its storm flap was ruffled. Ruffles were the big story. Cascading down the sides of a halter dress in a bright, blurry floral print and fluttering at the neckline of the shows best look, a gorgeous coral pink cocktail number, they evoked Yves Saint Laurent. Even a python-skin dress got the flounce treatment. Here and there on the shoulders of a blouse and the sides of a somewhat too-stiff woven raffia dress, those frills got the better of him. Hes no YSL (heck, probably not even Saint Laurent himself could live up to his legend now), but Wus output continues to mature. The work that went into the bodices of a camisole and a T-shirt dress, among other pieces, was so intricate it looked more like a print than a patchwork of five different kinds of lace. Otherwise, there was a healthy amount of the sportswear hes come to favor lately. Wu's tailoring is confident, and a pair of black suits with delicate lace underpinnings looked great with flat, strappy sandals. Also tempting: clingy knits in a mlange tweed for day, and, for evening, in fine-ribbed silk with more of that saucy fraying.$$Jean-Pierre Braganza invited some serious toe-tapping this afternoon in London. The British-born Canadian designer spent his summer between the research rooms of the British Library and the blank canvas of his studio, listening to jazz greats from Charles Mingus to John Coltrane. But their freewheeling musical influence found its form not in the brightly-lit looks that made their way down the runway, but in Braganzas improvisational approach to designing them. I never liked jazz when I was growing up, he said backstage. But now, the fact that its so structured and yet so chaotic really fascinates me. That frenetic spirit translated into endless draping and deconstruction: Hems were left undone and suits were radically reconfigured with entire panels left to hang loose. This may all sound wildly experimental, but, in fact, these clothes will do nothing to alienate Braganzas eternal muse, that all-powerful female who, on this front row lineup, was embodied by the spiral-curled British songstress Ella Eyre. The show found its headiest form in digital print dresses that drew on the visual style of the Bauhaus. But, come next spring, the real standouts will be the series of white zip-skirted coats and crepe trench coats worn over diaphanous duchesse satin dresses. All were subtle, understated, and executed with a lighter-than-air finesse. As an aside, there was a message in the fact that Braganza had eschewed his usually extensive show notes this time around. You guys are going to hate me, he said with a smile to the gaggle of journalists waiting backstage. I want you to use your cerebral abilities to see the story for yourselves.  Well, perhaps because of the show's title, Whiplashed, which was taken from the Oscar-winning Miles Teller movie (tap, tap, tap), there's one word that immediately springs to mind: upbeat.$$Click through Jenny Packhams past 10 or so collections and youll notice a common theme: Each one opened with an embellished dress. So when the first look at todays show was a black and red floral-printed suit, you had to wonder how Packham got there. When she rattled off a few of her favorite musicians backstageMick Jagger, Nick Cave, and David Bowieit all started to make sense. Packham was inspired by rock n roll legends who resisted gender strictures and werent afraid to indulge the more feminine aspects of their personalities. Packham herself was dressed in an oversize blazer, cropped pants, and creeper brogues: After decades in business, it was only a matter of time before she started taking a page from her own personal style. While the new emphasis on day-to-night dressing was promising, the androgynous concept didnt quite translate for many of the looks. The suits were a bit too boxy, and Packhams clientele relies on her for glitzy embellishments, not wildflower prints. Perhaps it was just muscle memory, but the glittering, red carpetworthy dresses were the ones that stood out. Consider Packhams most visible customer, Kate Middleton: Youd be hard-pressed to get her in a mannish blazer, but the jade georgette gown with draping at the hip would work perfectly.$$This is your brain. This is your brain on screens. If Jeremy Scotts latest collection had a subtextand its not clear that it didit was that our brains are going a little screwy due to overexposure to screens. Check out the insane-looking cartoon faces on Scotts new intarsia knits: Isnt that kind of how your mind feels after several consecutive hours of binge-watching UnREAL while simultaneously answering emails on your laptop and glossing Instagram on your phone? Anyway. The screen thing was very much an ur-text of Scotts latest effort, with its digital television prints and trippy sweaters knit to look the way old television screens did when they went a little wonky. That was all part of Scotts larger theme, which was an homage to sixties era B-movies and sci-fi that he interpreted with his typical heaping of club-kid flash. The eras tropes were rehearsed in everything from abbreviated A-line silhouettes to ray-gun prints to the paillette mesh that was an overt tip-of-the-hat to Cardin. As usual, Scott seemed to be having more fun making fashion than anyone else on the scene these days, but the lineups buoyant tone didnt disguise the fact that this was a pretty disciplined collection. The mens looks were eye-popping, but they hewed to classic shapesguys with some daring in the fashion department might be swayed by a button down in Scotts scribble print, or a leather biker spotted with white polka dots. Lots of the womens looks, meanwhile, could appeal to customers outside the Jeremy cult, to wit, the tulle pieces with high-contrast sequin stripes, or summery short sheaths covered in the scribble or raygun prints. A cocktail dress, black on top, with a ribbon at the waist and a bouffant pink and silver brocade skirt, was downright homecoming queen mainstream. Scotts rigor was also demonstrated in his materials and his technique. The paillettes on the opening look worn by Gigi Hadid, for instance, were bordered by seed pearl embroidery. And Scotts deftness with textiles was witnessed best in the very simplest of his ensembles, a matching cropped sweater and miniskirt set down in a cool spongy knit. Nothing looked tossed-off here, in other words, just as nothing looked really, truly nuts. Scotts experience at Moschino seems to have convinced him theres some fun to be had, too, in selling tons of clothes.$$Shes not too pretty, but dressed well. That was Ji Ohs summation of her Spring woman, who had a kind of haphazard, jolie laide, and faintly aggressive quality. The designers muse was tough, and her presentation backdrop was a construction sitelike mishmash of signage. Despite the streetwise jumping-off point, the clothes bore all the hallmarks of Ohs signature pared-back polish. Basics with a twist are the labels bread and butter (landing the line in doors like Barneys, Harvey Nichols, and Intermix), and this season offered them up in spades. There were pinstriped jumpsuits and a plunging silk slip dress; a cropped, cowl-neck sweatshirt; and easy wide-leg trousers. Change is incremental in Ohs world of modern staples: This season an eye for utilitarian hardware (snaps and zippers and buttons, oh my!) and a somber palette grounded in navy and white lent things a more androgynous edge, in contrast to the punched-up reds, cobalt, and metallic silver of seasons gone by. The real news here was denim. It was the first time Oh had taken on the textile, and she whipped a single wash into contrasting patch-pocket jackets (using the reverse), pull-on trousers, skinny jeans, and more. Dressed well, indeed.$$Its no secret that Jil Sander Navy knows its way around a clean pattern. But this season the labels variations on layering added a kick of cool to what could otherwise have been a buy-it-anywhere basic. Silhouettes were enhanced by skirts and shirts with peplums (not the teeny-bopping, out-to-brunch kind, but rather, smarterwith texture) that mushroomed out from under button-ups to create volume and a cinched waist. There were also puffed ruffles, which made for a pepped-up take on sleeves, and pointed hems on skirts that resembled a mans waistcoat. References to Henri Matisses cutouts came in jagged floral patterns that covered shirt and tank dresses in blue and white, as well as in hot pink and citrus orange. In a nod to Piet Mondrian, a perforated shirt and tank dress were tiered into green, yellow, and blue primary colorsa well-suited complement to the classic linear silhouettes. But it was the riff on athleticwear that turned basics into must-haves: Dresses were reminiscent of deconstructed parkas, fastened with horizontal elastic cording that cleverly created curves. A white skirt in the same outerwear style had a strip of fabric that acted like a belt, creating an unfinished empire waist that elegantly tufted out above the hipsa piece that could easily become a closet staple or a street style standout.$$Disciplined. Rigorous. Precise. Google Jil Sander and those three adjectives come up more than any others. Fashion, at this moment, is moving in a different direction; Spring is looking decidedly deshabille. Whats Rodolfo Paglialunga, installed at Jil Sander one year ago, to do? Remain faithful to the house codes, even as memories of the founder grow fuzzy? Go with the current flow? Its a conundrum that all designers charged with heading up old labels must face. After a couple runway shows that hewed to Sanders clean lines, Paglialunga tried option two.  An otherwise straightforward two-button blazer was sliced at the shoulder seams, another jacket was cut away in the back, and a third was deconstructed to look more like a pinafore than your standard double-breasted fare, but the tailoring wasnt so radical as to be alienating. The Sander-classic crisp white shirt got a revamp, too, in crinkly, slinky sky blue silk with an au courant cutout at the midriff. Rounding things out were the sort of slip dresses and wispy bits of silk that have been multiplying on other runways this season. Straps spilled off shoulders, and asymmetric necklines dipped to reveal the upper arm. Cutouts proliferated, not just at the waist, but near the hem of a sheath, or sliced vertically front and back on looser-fitting dresses. Paglialunga is a talented guy, but this collection gave you a twinge of the familiar. It made you miss Sanders hard edges a bit.$$Jill Stuart designs wearable, hyper-feminine clothes with a woman in mind, rather than a particular reference point. From the first look, it was clear Spring was all about an exuberant, hip-shaking party girl. There were yards of flowing satin, from a languid slip to the designers new take on the voluminous, high-neck blouse thats still trending right now. It was easy to envision Studio 54 when a pair of superwide flares hit the runway, but Stuart wasnt really that focused on the past. I think this is just how girls are dressing today, she explained backstage. She used adjectives like vibrant, dancy, and magneticthe same words you could use to describe Solange Knowles, who was sitting in the front row. Stuarts following is a loyal one, so the suede skirts and tiered floral gowns will no doubt generate long wish lists. But a few of the pieces wont be as easy to pull off, like high-rise satin culottes that spotlight your hips or a truly miniature ruffled bandeau. The best looks emphasized texture, but would still flatter a wide range of women, like a shimmery, ankle-length floral dress with a cropped sweater layered on top.$$Bill Gaytten indulged in some Anglophilia at his John Galliano show this evening. His was a gloss on the contradictions of British 20th-century style, rather than a straightforward homage to any particular erathere was, for instance, a hint of a country gentleman out for a shooting weekend in Gayttens checked tailoring, and meanwhile more than a hint of the punks who sneered at such men in his looks embellished with safety pins and studs.  Rave-era anoraks and dress-for-dinner frock-coats also got a look-in on the Galliano runway. But the standouts in this collection were indubitably Gayttens frothy dresses. These came in various romantic, barely there versions, some bedazzled in sequins, others paneled in lace, and still more boasting tiers of demure ruffles. The most eye-catching, though, were Gayttens polka-dot numbersthe graphic black-on-white pattern made for a nice counterpoint to the looks diaphanous cuts. They seemed well suited to some modern-day Lady Mary, of Downton famealthough, the Lady Marys of today would likely be inclined to throw Gayttens spongy dun-color parka on over that dress before heading out for the evening. British style is nothing if not eclectic. Gaytten captured that quality well.$$We like to think of ourselves as a coastal brand, says Rachel Wilder-Hill, the vintage-obsessed designer behind Joies easy, breezy designspieces she says balance L.A.s laid-back bohemian side with a touch of Parisian chic. As the great divide between high fashion and real women remains very present, collections like Joie are becoming more relevant than ever, thanks to their ability to tap into the little comfortable luxuries that women of all ages want to wear, without the forage of vintage shopping nor the conceptual trappings that can often plague runway brands. Its the little details that set us apart, continues Wilder-Hill, explaining the floral print on a braided silk slip dress. This motif came from a scrap of wallpaper I found at a Paris flea market and had repainted by our incredible in-house artist. While Joie began as a jeans brand in 2001, its evident that denim has taken a backseat to the expansive range of sundresses, floaty shirting, and peasant blouses that emphasize soft cotton fabrications for Springas gauzy voiles, topstitched embroideries, and broderie anglaise details instill a sense of decorative nostalgia in the dolman-sleeve silhouettes cinched with drawstrings, and skinny plaited belts. Some of the prettiest looks within the Spring lineup feature inserts of Victorian-inspired lacework, their delicacy balanced by stonewashed denim or light suede, keeping their historical leanings within Joies contemporary, feminine frame.$$In a light-drenched tent at noon on a sunny Sunday, Jonathan Saunders set out to show his audience his true colorsas a designer of effortless, breezy, sensuous clothes. Most of the collection was spun out of the success hes had with a certain bias-cut slip-dress design of a few seasons agoits paneled structure lends itself ideally to color-blocking and to matching and clashing prints that can be continually switched up. So, yes, there was a lot of that in his Spring show, but he also noted that it was the attitude of the bias cut he was trying to transmit by using trailing ribbon ties and shapes like wrap-over blouses and bathrobe coats. Essentially, of course, Saunders is a colorist and print and pattern specialist of long standing in London, and having acquired a new investor, this showwith its expensively purpose-built venuerepresents a turn of the page on the business front. He has acquired a new CEO and employees, which he says is freeing him up to concentrate on being creative and on the detail of luxury finishings on the inside of his clothes. Thats all good news for his following of grown-up women in the business, political, art, and fashion worlds.$$I think that women come to me when they want to get dressed up and feel strong, said Jonathan Simkhai before his Spring 2016 show: This collection proved that they could feel romantic, too. Technical lace, embroidered macram, and bonded burnout were rendered into figure-hugging cocktail frocks inspired by the tropes city-dwellers overlook every dayskyscrapers, subway grates, and scaffolding. But it wasnt purely urban-minded. The designer had spent several weeks this summer in Lake Como researching fabrics and developing a taste for country life, as evidenced most winningly by the loosened-up cotton voile dress worn with low-top white sneakers (and, less convincingly, in a pair of embroidered basketball shorts). I think its one of those grass-is-greener things, said Simkhai, referring to the seasonal exodus of Manhattanites who repair to various country escapes during the warmer months. Youre here and you want to be there, or youre there and want to be here. His idea seemed to be that with enough flounce and a little wiggle room (the type not necessarily encouraged by an embroidered macram trumpet skirt), one can manage both. Simkhai, a 2015 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist, has developed a following for his figure-skimming silhouettes among those who vote with their Instagram likesbright, young, and often photographed things like DJ Mia Moretti, who provided the shows soundtrack, and model Devon Windsor, who sat front row in something lacy, black, and body-con. And happily for Simkhai, thats the thing about bright young things: They always need more party dresses.$$It's become a bit cliched to talk about masculine/feminine now: Everyone's talking about it, observed an endorphin-pumped Louise Trotter after this interesting overload of a show. I wanted to play more with the role models of a male and a female, she said. Almost uniquely, this is a subject upon which fashion can be more explicit than words, for clothes are our most potent codifiers of gender. But lets try and keep up. We started with classically-for-Joseph neutral menswear-touched womenswear: Monochrome T-shirts, skirts, and sweats both held together and defined by twist and turn. There were plenty of unexpected rips and twists, whorls of construction. There were bengal stripe versus pencil stripe viscose silk shirtdresses and skirts, plus the odd drop of conventional feminized suiting teamed with sheer tailored mens shirts with girlishly ribboned cuffs. Then a shot of acid yellow and patent shine black leather signaled what Trotter saw as a break phase in the narrative from girl dressed as boy toand please bear with me heregirl dressed as boy dressed like girl. This allowed Trotter to blend pretty, gleaming vintage brocades into monkish, military-touched pieces trailed by nylon webbingthis second movements equivalent to the knots and bows wed just seen in the first. Her expression of this mood became less gilded and more repressedyou know, manlyuntil a last look that took us back, near full-circle, to the first. To see some of the still-shifting ground Trotter was attempting to survey here, see the Fall collections from Gucci or Craig Green. As an overviewand a point of viewthis Joseph collection was both dizzying and fascinating.$$For Fall, Josie Natori mined Istanbul for inspiration. For Spring, she trained her eye a little farther east. The whole collection is inspired by Asian painting, said the designer at todays presentationher first eveningwear-only outing. Natori said she was fascinated by calligraphy, and wanted to experiment with brushstrokes. To that end, an asymmetrical dress featured a straightforward black-and-white brushstroke, but Natori also used crystal embellishments to create the same effect on a white column dress and a black basket-weave gown (one of the strongest looks). You really cant go wrong with black and white, she remarked, dressed in a chic black shift dress. But color wasnt off the table entirely. The designer honored the season by playing with vibrant, slightly off-kilter color combinations. An expertly tailored fuchsia strapless tunic layered over orange stovepipe pants was a memorable look. Some of the kimono-inspired ensembles verged on being too literal, but Natori hit her stride when she incorporated elements of the traditional garb in subtler ways, as in the case of a pea green raw silk strapless number with an embellished obi-inspired neckline. That, said Natori, almost shyly, is one of my favorites.$$Fashion shows, with all of their required hustle and flow, can actually prove to be something of an obstacle for smaller design houses, as the average Fashion Week affair has become more like a performance piece (or a gesture of how much money a given brand has the ability to shell out) and less about its actual purpose, which is, you know, to show the clothes. Environmental worries (seating charts! The music! The lights! The lack of heat! The oppressive heat! The location!) are the immediate concerns, and the details of a given collection often get lost in the shuffle. So when it came to his Spring 2016 show, Juan Carlos Obando wasnt taking any chances. I want you to turn this jacket inside out, he said at one of many private appointments he is holding today in a small space near Saint-Germain, proffering a cropped waxed organza version with generous bell sleeves. Look at what weve done! The piece felt as smooth and as light as cotton, and yes, the details (stitches, seams, lines) were perfect. This perfection is a sticking point with Obando, who has leaned hard into the technical aspects of his manufacturing this season: Hes employed exclusive Italian mills; hes hired more hands on deck to supervise the construction. Count the stitches! I am so proud of these details, he said, highlighting the bias-cut trim of a silk tank top, the corners at the edge of a scarf tie. I never want to be a brand that looks or feels cheap. I hear enough from my friends about how clothes look one way on Instagram, and then entirely another in a store. And as Obando has realized, the chasm between an Instagram like and an actual purchase lies in the physical here and now: How does it feel, how does it look, and, most important, is it worth it? Obando launched with Neiman Marcus and Net-a-Porter last season, and a plethora of trunk shows has made him increasingly aware of what women want: less gowns, more separates. Things that can be worn to work and then adjusted (either by adding a skirt or a heel) for evening engagements. Comfort, a sense of romance, a hint at a vibrant inner life. Its not about an impossible, inspirational womanits about how the clothes make them feel, he said, in what has become a bit of a refrain among designers this season. These were elegant, easy looks based around decadently heavy silk separates (those Italian mills!), like a camisole with a tie-waist and furls of fabric below the shoulders (the addition of a skirt slit on the bias turns it red-carpet-ready), a slip dress that loops and ties around the wrists, striped fishermans pants (those perfect seams again!). Deceptively simple pieces were worked with subtle details: shirtdresses with scarf-tied necklines that trail behind you as you walk, a column skirt slit in the front and back to move like trousers, with the stitching (the yarn the same as those used in baseballs, the designers nod to a recent trip to Cuba) picked out. Its about courtship, Obando said. Im obsessed with courtshipthe whole thing, my designs, seeing them on a hanger in the store, trying it on, I am courting the women, trying to convince them to fall in love. Judging by these clothes, hes going to have a very full dance card come spring.$$Its probably been a while since youve wornor thought aboutJuicy Couture. But after years of bad news for the brand, a glimpse at its Spring collection reveals that business is boomingjust probably not where you live. There arent any Juicy stores left in the United States, but China has nearly 100. Los Angeles and Dallas are important cities for Juicy, too, but its clear that the real money is way east. As such, it was admittedly difficult to parse the sprawling Spring lineup, since it was designed with a different market in mind. The collection was separated into several delivery groups, each one driven by an of-the-moment trend. There were boho florals, a longtime Juicy signature, as well as graphic, 80s-inspired logo tees, and neon tweed jackets, which felt vaguely reminiscent of Jeremy Scotts recent collections for Moschino. Here in New York, designers have been embracing a more natural, crafty approach to dressing, but Juicy was all about the opposite: bright colors, short hemlines, and graphic prints. Still, there were a few straightforward, well-constructed pieces that would fit into even the most edited wardrobes, like the crisp ponte jackets, high-rise flared jeans, and foulard-print pants, which read like elevated pajamas. As for Juicys infamous velour track suits, theyre still aroundthey even inspired Juicy Sport, a brand-new, equally colorful new label of athletic wear.$$This was the 10th Paris womenswear show in the cutely unique Julien David narrative: His is a label conceived in France but entirely manufactured in Japan, where he lived for a decade. Seven years after launching, he has 100 stockists and says that 40 percent of his sales hail from the country in which his clothes are made. So it seemed right and proper that todays collection was a gentle exploration of the similarities and differences between his two home nations. The differences were articulated most clearly in his contrasting  use of sunflower and cherry blossom prints or workwear-lean jackets and carpenter coats and pants. The panniers on asymmetrical-pleat skirts could have been sourced from Marie Antoinettes wedding dress or Diors Bar suit and servedif you stretched it a bitto produce a Gallic version of the ornamental exaggeration ohashori. There was plenty of denimin dungaree dresses, more carpenter coats, topstitched jeans, and appealingly curve-leg, four-button pants. Nmes, France, is where legend has it this most ubiquitous cotton twill originated, and despite the role of North American teenage culture in ubiquitizing denim, it is (arguably) Japan where some of todays finest quality is milled. Davids is from Okayama. Vinyl laminated over embroidery on elastic-cinched, flute-hipped T-shirts, fleur-de-lis fil coupes, undone Brigitte Bardot bustiers as outerwear, and resin-backed cotton crop tops were among the further passing pleasures here. The soundtrack was a willfully strange collision of Needle in the Hay and Brush Your Teeth, while the mustachioed gentleman on a silk jacquard romper worn beneath a full black skirt and bustier was Henri, the designers grandfather. This was Jean de Florette meets Swept Away, marinated in Davids personal preoccupations. Together these ingredients made for an interesting and quietly progressive pot-au-feu. Or nikujaga.$$There were whoops and cheers even before the crowd caught sight of the first look at todays Julien Macdonald show, held at the centuries-old Smithfield Market. In a fashion world where trends rotate on an ever faster axis, theres something comforting about a designer who holds fast to familiar terraineven when thats as revealing as the spangly, flapper-age dress that opened proceedings. Though you wouldnt have guessed it until a ways through this mammoth 52-look collection, this past summer Macdonald traded the club podiums of the Balearic Isles for the black-sanded beaches of Bali. I properly chilled out for the first time in my life, he said post-show. There was so much inspiration to be found in the tranquility and raw natural beautyand all the traditional textiles.  When Macdonald started sketching out Spring 2016, it was these Balinese batiks that he drew on. They provided the collections biggest moment: the designers main-line menswear debut. Tropical prints showed up on beach-y tunic tops and silk shorts that Macdonald says he has been trying to get around to creating for the past 20 years. But I didnt want to just do camp menswear, he said, counting Puff Daddy and Kanye West amongst those whod have a taste for this kind of directional dressing. Yet, Macdonald being Macdonald, he couldnt resist adding sparkles even here. Forget the finale gowns and the intricately woven web knits that remained his mainstayin the mind of this Welshman, its always going to be all about the rhinestones, even for the boys.$$Junya Watanabe set his show in the National Museum of Immigration History in Paris, an immense Art Deco place, built to celebrate the cultural benefits of French colonialism, when that sort of thing was thought to accrue to the glory of the republic. On the way in, guests passed a piece of contemporary art which gave some people pause: a wooden boat, filled to heaving point with bundles wrapped in African fabric. It took but a small leap to associate that with another scene at Dismaland, where Banksy's boats filled with miniature models of immigrants floated on a disused Weston-super-Mare holiday pond.  An uncomfortable choice of surroundings, then, for Watanabe to show us a collection themed around African fabric patterns, on a cast of white models whose faces were decorated with pale fleshcolor globules, mimicking tribal scarification marks. It was hard to know which way to react. Watanabe is as known for his quiet pacifism and his silent rebellious streak as he is for never giving explanatory quotes. Was it a commentary on fashion's long record of annexing the dress, art, and religious artifacts of other peoples? Should he be criticized for doing that? And how does he view that from Tokyo, living in a country whose culture is constantly appropriated by Western fashion (as seen only this week in John Galliano's geisha-themed show)? Anyway: There was no denying the anxiety of watching Watanabe's show through the prism of all these contextual and moral questions. A pity, because at the beginning, there was a clear view to beautiful, loose smocks and shirtdresses, some with draped belled sleeves, and semi-sheer fabrics, some of which involved black matte lace constructed in a pattern which merged a sense of camouflage with animal pattern. After that came two looks with a knitted tiger amid leopard pelts thrown over the shoulders as wraps; also great. No doubt the African wax-print looks, which followed, will be prove as easy and commercial summerwear in stores; but at the same time, they will leave some feeling uneasy.$$When presented with the opportunity from the WCFDA (an initiative from the CFDA and W Hotels) to take a research trip, rather than going abroad, Kaelen Haworth struck out on an all-American road trip. Stopping in New Orleans, as well as Austin, Marfa, and Dallas, Texas, the designer was struck by the various landscapes, particularly the harshness and graphic appeal of the desert. And so came a collection sparer and more sophisticated than some of seasons gone by. Shapes skewed toward a certain utility, even at the dressiest: A floor-skimming T-shirt dress was boxy and came with patch pockets, though its generous slit and fantastic chartreuse hue added plenty in the way of appeal. Likewise, the versatility of a sleeveless jumpsuit in elephant-gray suede didnt need to be explainedit fairly cried out to be teamed with your everyday kicks, or sky-high wedges and a clutch. Haworth continued last seasons explorations with knitwear, and while you wont find much in the way of the slouchy or the oversize, her clingy ribbed knits are top-notch. The sparseness of these pieces was a promising development for the label; still, it wasnt all minimalism and no play. Shimmering silver linen culottes and a cowl-back metallic rose gold slip nodded to the labels more feminine proclivities of the past in a soign new way.$$Karen Walker has a thing for the esoteric. Last season she was inspired by obscure British sci-fi series Sapphire and Steel, and this season it was a remote town in Russia that provided her jumping-off pointand the only link between the two is that youve probably never heard of either. Backstage before her show, Walker explained her inspiration: We came across these photos, taken in the 80s, of this unmarked town just north of Moscow called Star City, that was a secret military training base for the Soviet Unions space program. And there were all these photos of these funny, folksy, chintzy Russian sitting rooms but with space suits and space gloves. Walker, always a fan of intriguing juxtapositions, said she wanted to contrast the folksy, domestic, and ordinary with high-tech, cutting-edge utility. And, she continued, a shot of glam. Because it was quite an elite, glamorous city. It was difficult to make heads or tails of the idea. But then the show started. If Walker is a little bonkers for using such bizarre, obscure reference points, there is certainly a method to her madness: She was able to suffuse elements of her inspiration into an utterly wearable collection. A small detail like an extended exposed zipper on high-waisted pants recalled the training jumpsuits astronauts might wear, without hitting the viewer over the head with the revelation. You wouldnt think that space suits and peasant blouses go together, but Walker somehow made it work: Supple gold leather pieces (a nod to the Mercury space suit) were styled with Edwardian blouses and ribbed sweaters (and sometimes topped with a jaunty necktie). There was an 80s vibe to the whole collection, which exerted itself most boldly in the acid-washed denim pieces. Walker also ingeniously added a horizontal zipper to two floaty white dresses, allowing the wearer to zip off the bottom and create a shorter dress or top. It proved that utility neednt be slick or complicated to be effective.$$Outside the Kate Spade New York presentation, a balmy scent of flowers seemed to douse the surrounding sidewalks: Chief creative officer Deborah Lloyd had partnered with the floral company FTD, placing almost 30,000 flowers in the space. After a harsh winter, when that first day of spring breaks, how relieved we all are to buy our first flowers at the bodega, she said of the inspiration. And that feeling was evident in the clothes: Flowers were everywhere, mostly in patterns. There were florets in grayscale shades splattered onto an A-line skirt, and in abstract black and white on a shift dress; delicate daisies dotted a slouchy jumpsuit.  But it was the more pared-back use of floral printsand springtime colorsthat hit home. The subtle outline of blossoms was charmingly laser-cut onto the hem and neckline of a daffodil yellow fit-and-flare frock, and the same pattern was smartly infused into a polished skirt set. Reminiscent of a stylish stroll to the corner store, there was a charming white sequin shift dress, striped in candied tones of pastel rose, sunflower, royal blue, and apricot. But the real winner? A black strapless cocktail dress covered in petal appliqus was the freshest and most perennial piece.$$Katie Ermilios designs have quickly become staples of the red carpet, trotted out by celebrities like Jessica Alba, Taylor Swift, and Selena Gomez. With the designer's Spring collection, which emphasized curve-skimming silhouettes and self-created luxe fabrics, it was obvious that her focus hasnt wavered from occasion-dressing. Taking tennis as a theme, Ermilio translated the aerial views of center court into sleek strapless gowns, empire-waist jumpsuits, and fitted double-faced silk skirts, converting the fresh palette of the racquet grounds into a smooth color wheel of Pepto pinks and sage greens.  Ermilios use of linear patterns smartly complemented her body-hugging fits. A pinstripe duchesse dress mirrored the grids on the court, while the tonal checks in emerald gave a high-waisted trumpet skirt less of a froufrou effect and more structure. But Ermilio also put a pointed spin on her eveningwear specialty by creating separates that could easily become elevated daytime pieces. For example, there was pair of Betty Drapertype, pink checked high-waisted trousers that could just as easily be worn with a classic white tee or Ermilios matching crop top in four-ply silk. Not just for cocktail hour, the designer seemed to say, and we couldnt agree more.$$A collection titled Chinatown might conjure up images of girls in silk qipao dresses and embroidered pajamas. But the New York City neighborhoods mash-up of Chinese traditions, crowded streets, and diverse residents has been a constant source of inspiration for Katie Gallagher throughout her career. The designer has lived and worked in the area for nearly a decade, and for Spring she translated its singular energy into clothes that were easy, minimal, and just a touch charming. Its really just about my take on Chinatown, and what I smell, feel, and see when Im there, Gallagher said. That came through in the color palette, which was predominantly black and white with pops of red and goldlike Chinese gold, or a taxibut it was also felt in the delicate textures. Still, the stone-washed silk slip dresses would no doubt stand up to the Mott Street hustle; some of them had a vaguely Eastern influence with apron necklines. Gallagher also whipped up a slouchy cherry red tote as a nod to the plastic shopping bags you pick up at Chinatown markets. That tongue-in-cheek accessory lent a softer, more playful element to the collection: It felt fresh for Gallagher, whose oeuvre is characteristically more edgy and conceptual.$$Designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon love a far-flung, unexpected destination for their Kenzo shows. Those who made it out to the Nineteenth Arrondissement this morning, though, were transported to a different milieu in more ways than one: Gigantic white arches were stacked on the runway, and painted with the shades of pink and peach that recalled the sun-washed architecture of Mediterranean towns, such as Portofino in Italy.   Kenzo is a brand that's global and nomadic at its core, so having endless summer vacation vibes built into the set was a nice touch. And with their new collection, the New York duo addressed how a well-traveled, modern woman can put some of that feeling into her everyday wardrobe. The word swimtimates will sound unfamiliar to some, but essentially it takes the traditional idea of a bathing suit into your lingerie drawer, an approach to summer dressing that cool young things on the festival circuit will understand. There were compelling renditions on the runway that were worth flaunting: knit, geometric pieces that peeked from under spaghetti utilitarian minidresses and updates on the 90s bodysuits that were paired with printed miniskirts.  The fanny pack, that other 90s favorite, got a makeover too, and the best example was fashioned military style, with three small pouches on a waist-cinching belt. Lim and Leon have a knack for making practical and Instagrammable accessories like this, though the ornate chandelier earrings and bold necklaces were a little misplaced within the sporty, graphic context of the collection. The sensible, ankle-strap gladiator sandals that came with spiky reflexology footbeds put the skin-baring, printed looks on a fresh footing.$$The last time Kimora Lee Simmons formally presented her KLS collection, it was back in December, when her label made its debut. In the meantime, Simmons has been busyshe gave birth to a son and opened up the KLS Kimora Lee Simmons flagship in Beverly Hills, in a jewel-box space, as Simmons described it today. The new KLS collection also demonstrated that Simmons has spent the intervening months evolving her labels point of view, if only slightly. There was the same emphasis on graphic pencil dresses, executed in flattering ponte blends, and a similar smattering of sporty pieces, like a pair of slouchy trousers with a track-pant stripe down each leg. But Simmons included a broader range of silhouettes this time aroundfull skirts and minis, Grecian-draped dresses and gowns, boxy blazers, and a fairly broad array of trouser shapes. The best of the latter was the mannish pair of slacks done in a slightly shiny pinstripe, which the designer showed with a matching halter-neck vest. It was a sexy, feminine take on a classic menswear look. Another new development here was Simmonss expanded range of separates, of which the standouts were her crisp shirts with sheer panels and leather biker jackets with sleeves that zipped off to three-quarter-length. All in all, the collection felt more rounded than the debut, and it had a lot more spark. Onward and upward.$$For the runway debut of her year-old label, Koch, Christelle Kocher turned the lower concourse of Les Halles into her venue and set the showtime for 9:00 p.m. With all the mall shops closed and commuters dispersedand with no actual runway save for the orderly clustering of gueststhe cavernous, brutalist space gave many clues to her brand positioning. Kocher pointed out how the show space was non-elitist yet in the heart of Paris; within five minutes of the Louvre yet adjacent to the citys busiest public transport station; accessible yet unpredictable. Her casting ranged from Soo Joo Park and Charlotte Free to a girl handpicked off the street to her neighbor in the 20th arrondissement. But even without a single auxiliary aid, the clothes broadcast how the intersection of couture detailing and streetwear styling could lead to a kinetic, distinctively contemporary collection. Kocher also serves as the artistic director for Maison Lemari, one of the specialist ateliers (in this case, feathers) owned by Chanel subsidiary Paraffection. Embroideries undertaken by sister ateliers Montex and Lesage embellished sports bras, basketball shorts, T-shirts, and parkas, showing how craftsmanship remains a designers ultimate power play. The tank bedecked in feathers and bling, the tracksuit encrusted with tulle, and the bodysuit paved in iridescent paillettesif these pieces arent destined for performers known by their acronym aliases (M.I.A. and FKA twigs, were looking at you), then they demand personalities with comparable moxie. Still, its too early to tell whether Kocher is trying to degrade flashy or elevate trashy. Likely both. At least that was the impression made by the earrings and rings she created with Goossens, the couture jewelry atelier. They spread across fingers and crawled up ears like mangled marvels.$$Junichi Abe launched Kolor more than a decade ago as a mens line, one aimed at a certain type of stylish man, the kind for whom a sweatshirt is never just a sweatshirt, and whose sneaker selection is not necessarily a reflection of his athleticism. Abes comparatively fledgling womens collection, now in its second official season, has a markedly similar aesthetic in mind: military touches on parkas and vest pockets, narrow-cut cotton trousers topped with netted tulle, and of course, sweatshirts, though here they boast jersey backs or pleated tulle trimmings, along with the occasional frilled, high collarVictoriana meets Champion. Abe develops all of his textiles himself, and they are unique to the house, so what might feel de rigeurhammered silver and gold lace, metallic-stamped organzaupon close inspection is subtly spectacular, the lace here pleated, miraculously, to show its shiny underside. Layered oversize polka-dot T-shirts were worn loose off the body and over houndstooth printed shorts, an exploration of what a brand representative (Abe was not present at the presentation) called where good taste meets bad taste. Ballooning skirts appeared to be made of parachutes, if parachutes were also made of tutus. Abe has never been afraid of a little color, and bold stripes reigned supreme, with flashes of fluorescent tones put to good use on trims, like that of a standout bomber jacket, slim and olive and just the type of layering piece any person needs in their wardrobe for an unpredictable spring. Shoes, a new undertaking for the designer, came in three styles: a thick, ridge-soled kitten-heel pump, a platform brogue, and a platform sandal inspired by one from the men's collection, the top rendered in richly earth-toned suede. The aim of this collection, an aide explained, is in step with much of this season: not to dress some impossible woman, but rather, real women, specifically, the Kolor Man's girlfriend. At least they're in good company.$$KTZ designer Marjan Pejoski and partner Sasko Bezovski decamped to New York Fashion Week last season, saying at the time that they werent sure where theyd be unveiling future collections because they liked the idea of going where the spirit moved them. As it turned out, they wound up back in London this season, and it seems that Pejoski was seeing his hometown with fresh eyes. If theres one inescapable sight in London these days, its the construction site: This town is evolving at speed. The new KTZ collection seized on both the imagery of the construction site and its augury of a remapped cityscape; signs at the club space where the KTZ show was held tonight blinked the phrase The World to Come. These clothes had a very different tone from the ones shown by KTZ in recent seasons. The labels signature club kid vibe remained in place, but Pejoski cashed in the nomadic vibe of previous collections and conjured a gritty urban feeling in its place. Out with the tribal motifs and heavy mirror embroidery, in with chain-link patterns, paint spatter, and wordy patches redolent of pasted-up flyers. This seasons most intriguing evolution, meanwhile, was found in the tailored looks, like a sculptural trench coat made out of a fabric that resembled a crumpled brown paper bag. The suggestion was made explicit by Pejoskis fluttering handle embellishments, which he also used on looks in black leather. There was a menacing quality to this collection. Nothing too overt, though there was a gothic note to some of the looks. What read as dark was Pejoskis way of spotlighting the visual elements of the city we generally try not to seethe blur of litter and temporary fencing around the lots where shiny skyscrapers are going up. You got the feeling that the club kids who comprise the cult of KTZ number among the things unseen that will be swept away when the new city emerges. Pejoski proffered the optimistic The World to Come tonight. He might equally well have opted for The Last Rave.$$The French sportswear label founded almost a century ago by tennis champ Ren Lacoste had the good sense in 2010 to install Felipe Oliveira Baptista at the creative helm. If they were looking to jazz up the brand with youthful verve and crisp urbanism, for which the Portuguese designer was then becoming known, thats exactly what they got. Which is to say, at the mens and womens Spring collection today, tellingly few polo shirts could be spotted, and there was little croc insignia. We may see some Olympic inspiration as the rest of the collections play out, but not every brand can lay claim to it the way Lacoste can. The label will once again dress the French Olympic delegation as the athletes in Rio make their way around the opening ceremony next year. And there is a historical link: Lacoste himself was an Olympic medalist back in 1924. Thats how Baptista arrived at the theme of flags for Spring, channeling the victorious moment an Olympian is draped in his or her countrys flag upon winning gold. He abstracted, fragmented, and recombined any number of national bannersFrench, Swiss, Japanese, Americanany number of ways, across shirts, tanks, shorts, jackets (often tied around the waist), ponchos, and otherwise simple suits. Against that kind of kaleidoscope, an all-silver jumpsuitalluding to those shiny blankets athletes wear for warmthstood out all the more. The closing looks, with their jumble of stars and stripes all jostling for attention, couldnt have made a more provocative statement without crossing over into trite rainbow territory. Ultimately, said Baptista, its about peace and diversity.$$And, bringing the heart, soul, and attitude back to Paris fashion, please welcome . . . Mr. Alber Elbaz! Theres a little bit of a fightback against one-note, compliantly market-obedient fashion going on at the moment, and how nice it was to see Alber Elbaz putting Lanvin out there on the front line tonight. He staged his Spring collection literally as theater, placing the Lanvin name up in glittering lights at one end of the runway and sending out a show he said was a manifesto. More on Elbazs underlying thoughts later. In the moment, it was the fast pace of his girls and their almost fierce range of character that turned this into a hit Lanvin variety performance. The show moved swiftly through acts. First, black and white daywearpants and blouses with balloon sleeves or rippling flounces were followed by chic-simple silk dresses and sculptural cocktail numbers. Parodies of body-exposing draped jersey red carpet gowns, underpinned with nude corsetry, gave way to madly glittery party things with a wacky finaleof busy Lanvin souvenir prints featuring patterns of shoes and bags, and funny graffitied handbags. But back to the manifesto. Elbaz described in a preview how hed been struggling to work through the puzzles confronting designers in a digital age. What is relevant today? Is it need or provocation? Can fashion and theater coexist? He concluded that he should try to show all-encompassingextremes, and, just as importantly, leave evidence of his work in progress. We saw that human touch in the black dresses that were collaged from several types of lace and the lines of white basting stitches left in the folds of a black gazar skirt. Still, there is little need for backstory explanations when the transcendent desirability of clothes speaks as directly to an audience as it did tonight.$$Lela Rose did a lot of hiking this past year, and this season she wanted to bring the overgrown fields of wildflowers she stumbled upon during her rambling walks onto the runway. The challenge, then, was how to incorporate floralsa done-to-death spring motifin a new way. Rose was more interested in the endless variations  present in nature than anything else, so she injected her blooms with surprising hits of metallic and neon pink and yellow for a twist on the classic pattern. She also played around with texture and embellishments. In addition to her signature fil coupe, there were metallic tweed dresses hemmed with fringe, jacquard stamped with metallic, and even a blush skirt and shell top combination that made a case for crochet after dark.  Rose is perhaps best known for her feminine and romantic dresses, and while those were on full display, the designer also showed shes willing to forgo some of the sweetness for a little freshness. A blush jumpsuit would have been saccharine with a full bow at the waistinstead, Rose left the knot slightly undone. A white shirt and short combo, which almost appeared to be made from a sporty mesh, turned out to be made from a perfectly country clubappropriate white eyelet. Her willingness to get outside of her comfort zone worked in her favor for the most part, but it also led to a few missteps. A gray knit dress felt a bit out of place, and some of the crystal embellishment verged into tween territory.  But Roses customer is not necessarily after anything groundbreaking, and there were plenty of looks that were just plain pretty. A white organza gown embroidered with white flowers would make a stunning wedding dress, while a cotton poplin shirtdress with a wide metallic hem proved that Roses grown-up elegance can indeed be artfully translated for day.$$The Uniqlo and Lemaire collection goes on sale Friday at Uniqlo stores, including the one here in Paris near the Palais Garnier. We spied at least one editor plotting her purchases on her phone; Im planning on spending a thousand dollars, another confided. Christophe Lemaire and his partner, Sarah-Linh Tran, have been instrumental in setting the current vogue for a covered-up, calm, yet alluring silhouette. For women who crave the look (and men; theyve also done a mens range with a restrained, uniform-like sensibility), the chance to get it at Uniqlo prices is too good to pass up.  Back at their own label, Lemaire and Tran continued to work within their familiar framework. Fringed scarves tied high on the neck and leather boots with woven espadrille soles gave the collection a slightly Spanish flavor. Otherwise, the tailoring was away from the body, perhaps more than usual, with side seams curving around the legs of pants, causing them to bell at the hem. Lengths were midi and longer, and aside from a single off-the-shoulder top, there was little in the way of skin. Skin is something this show could have used more of. A couple of the models were swimming in their artist smocks, and the dress-over-pants situation felt heavy for a Spring collection. Were not calling for a volte-face here, just recognition that the collection tilted a touch too austere. That said, there was romance if you looked hard enough. Je suis belle on me la dit (Someone told me Im beautiful) was printed in lilting script at the bottom of a soft white blouse. Indeed, the model who wore it was.$$A brazenly colorful Leonard show took place just steps from the Andy Warholwallpapered faade of the Muse dArt Moderne, where a new retrospective on the artist opened last week. Whether sheer coincidence or timely homage, the collection, which remains overseen by Parisian designer Yiqing Yin, stayed loyal to the Leonard archivesno soup cans, bananas, or hibiscus flowers. But the saturation of hues, dynamic pattern arrangements, integration of graphic text, and repetition of screened images all traced back to an unmistakable source. Yin cited an urgency for what she called a livelier look when describing how the filmy printed organza, lacquered eel skin, and woven leather sneakers and sandals all appeared triple-dipped in primary pigments. But the show introduced these elements gradually; the opening grouping featured faint rainbow crosshatching, with the diaphanous skirt prettiest of all. As the lineup transitioned from white as its anchor, to red, and then to cobalt blue, Yin applied increasing creative license to the heritage; slick Windbreakers and color-blocked dresses with deep draping and frisky cutouts were the most street-influenced shes gone so far. In some cases, too much print mixing turned chaotic. Backstage and off the runway, however, these same pieces proved rather refined. The museum retrospective happens to be called Warhol Unlimited. Leonard can pursue this same artistic intensity and distinctive vision as long as it accepts that some of its longtime customers might not be willing to come along for the ride.$$The Far East has been exerting an influence on some of this seasons catwalks. China and Japan are obviously more than booming markets; paying homage to their cultural heritage while enticing a massive customer base with a huge spending potential is on every brands radar. At todays Les Copains show, creative director Stefania Bandiera was following the already ripe trend. Backstage she mentioned a muse who was a modern Madame Butterfly, a contemporary geisha, an educated traveler, an art lover. Being a contemporary geisha might seem like something of an oxymoron, but Bandiera appeared positively unfazed. Kimonos and samurais, cherry blossoms and peonies, exotic birds and birch forests, Ming porcelains and lacquered reds, camellias and Silk Roads: With the exception of Marco Polo, all the obvious references were present. The collection was built around the elaborate jacquard and knitwear techniques for which Les Copains is known: Circle skirts with asymmetrical hems were paired with folded bustiers cinched at the waist with elasticated obis or worn with thick hand-knitted micro tops; short peplum dresses were cut with an elegant origami draping effect. High-waisted trousers were elongated and fluid; they were topped by short, sporty blousons made with what Bandiera called virtual, illusory knitwear, a sort of virtuoso technique of weaving an extremely thin yarn to achieve a delicate, barely there look. They added a modern, energetic spin to a collection that, despite all the overly literal, hypercharged references, looked quite balanced and wearable.$$Every designers worst nightmare? Johnson Hartig just lived it when UPS lost a pair of boxes in transit to New York City containing not a couple, but 20 to 30 of Libertines key garments for their Spring show. Fortunately this seasons offering was a larger one than usual for the label, but Hartigs team still had to scramble for 48 hours to make tonights show come to pass. A punkish, DIY ethos has always characterized the designers work, and on tonights runway there it was, writ large. (Its also the subject of a forthcoming Rizzoli coffee-table book about the label, out later this month.) Had the show notes not told of the calamity, youd never have guessed it had occurred. Here was a collection as deliciously profuse as any of Libertines past efforts, with inspirations that included fluorescence cell research and Staffordshire dogs. The latter came after a World of Interiors spread on Hartigs home decreed that Johnson Hartig is making Staffordshire dogs cool again. And so the traditional porcelain pooches came to be one of the collections reigning motifs, seen sparkling on the front of the killer opening coat, or printed all over a caftan. The fluoro cells lent the clothes a goodly dose of Day-Glo, and appeared as electric-looking microbes on a mens sweatshirt; microscopes could be spotted among the eyes. There were also Buddhas, beakers, and perfume bottles on various toppers. Speaking of outerwear (a Hartig forte), among Springs highlights were a cream-color trench with ambiguous, drippy-looking blobs rendered in pink studs, and a stunning brocade coat with the wordswhat else?Joie de Vivre emblazoned across the back. More references, more fabrications, more fun. Look at the great Bergdorf Goodman exclusive hand-painted clutches from illustrator Donald Robertson, who sat front row alongside one of the loftiest iconoclasts of them all, Iris Apfel. On the bags youll find Morticia and Gomez Addams, a crimson pout, a forkful of spaghetti, and God knows what else. Heels, meanwhile, came tricked out with Day-Glo plastic chains. How does the Libertine woman walk with all those chains clacking at her feet, you ask? As she does all things: unapologetically.$$Theres no doubt that Lisa Perry knows how to create a summer-ready wardrobe, and today, with temperatures surging up into the 90s, her light dresses in punchy shades could not have been more appropriate. The collection was a direct response to the artist Robert Irwin's series of paintings Whos Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue? And Perry was evidently not afraid, with pieces like a shift dress in bold Piet Mondrian tiers of black, white, red, yellow, and blue, and a swing dress dotted with geometric shapes in the same color palette. Perry also used jewel tones in a set of cocktail looks: a royal blue dcolletage-diving dress and a high-neck crimson frock. For those who prefer more toned-down hues rather than the standout color wheel, there was a charming set of little black dresses, including one with spliced sleeves and a dickey collar, and a midi dress with patent-leather piping. Minimalist adornments elevated the more pared-back pieces: A black linen tunic had large grommets on bell sleeves, while a white halter dress used the grommet as a loophole for the neck strap.   In addition to the muted and primary color palettes, Perry didnt forget her signature shock of hot pink. It was there in a long T-shirt dressa perfect piece for anyone who fears nothing beyond the red, yellow, and blue.$$Im interested in leather techniques and innovation, said Jonathan Anderson. I want to work with that, and to sharpen the edge. He was speaking at the conclusion of a Loewe presentation that threw out hard-to-define imagerya bit spacey, a bit 80s, but in another sense, totally grounded in a house reality. Give or take a couple pairs of plastic-wrap trousers and transparent pants, the show Anderson pulled together was essentially a brilliant walking exhibition of accessories. He is a curator with an eye for placing multiple products in an interesting context and making them wantable from many angles. Take the jewelry. Once youd seen the gold bracelets with their gold fringes pouring down the hand, the eye was inevitably drawn to the bags and the variety of things that were happening with the signature Puzzle shape. I wanted the bags to articulate the look, to electrify it, said Anderson. The house of Loewe is an old, established Spanish fine leather company, but Anderson understands that nothing could be duller than to dutifully put a luxurious leather coat with a matching bag. His project is to de-bourgeois-ify the context, and thats how he came up with the device of using man-made materialsPVC, injection-molded syntheticsnext to the traditional: I thought, what else could be like a second skin? Whats really clever is the way every look can be parsed down to desirable components. Where there are impossibly wearable plastic wrap pants, there is also a regular sweater with a sheer yoke destined to go straight to retail. Where theres a showpiece tunic, covered in smashed mirror pieces, so are there dozens of buyable shard earrings. Alongside the avant-garde Puzzles there are just as many made in beautiful leather and suede. Equally as smart is the placement of the wholly normal within this new hyper-styled arrangement. There was nothing at all outrageous about the superfine, patchworked suede tracksuit in this showits the sort of leisure purchase Loewe has been selling to its existing customers for decades. Now maybe a fashion-bent trophy hunter will be looking for that sort of thing, too. In that way, Anderson is keeping everyone happy: editors and photographers wholl want to shoot the extreme image, as well as fashion-conscious shoppers and the people whove been buying Loewe as part of a lifestyle for years. Not to mention the brands owner, LVMH, which must be standing back and admiring what Anderson is doing for the bottom line by now.$$And here are the handbags, in the back, if youd like to see them, too? Ah, yes, the handbags! Longchamp sells a great many of those. Since 1993, more than 32 million examples of one model aloneLe Pliage, its signature nylon or all-leather totehave dangled from tasteful wrists around the world. Which made Sophie Delafontaines question a telling one, for by placing this ready-to-wear collection at the front of her presentation and tucking that core product away at the back, Longchamps artistic director was making a statement: Were not just all about about the bags, capisce? Which is kind of true. With great restraint, Delafontaine resisted any urge to garland her RTW-clad lookbook models with too many of her handbags. But when she didand once you had seen both front of presentation and backit became apparent how closely the design notes of the two categories aligned. So a sweet, simple, graphic, and slightly oversize T-shirt of soft pink cut by thick black lines at the waist and sleeves matched exactly the colorways of a leather reversible tote next door. That pink brushstroke print featured on the clothes (most successfully on a summer-night white zip-up coat) as well as the bags, as did the stripes in monochrome and two shades of green. Ditto the interestingly shimmery metallic finish that was rippled with orange and yellow. The standout pieces were the most straightforward; the contra-color popper-pocket shorts and skirts were supercute, as were the raw cut, fabric-lined leather bombers. Depending on what you wear under it, the transparent hooded mini trench could look pretty good, too. And that solar flareeffect leather in a little ripcord hoodie would make fine music festival outerwear. This collection is a rather literal exercise in brand extension, truebut it contains some attractive and wearable pieces that could serve as usefully in a summer wardrobe as a Le Pliage does in your hand.$$We exist on the digital frontier, at the dawn of a virtual age in which all experience will be filtered through screens. Nicolas Ghesquire, long one of fashions most intrepid designers, isnt looking back. Since he arrived at Louis Vuitton in early 2014, the idea of travel has propelled him; Vuitton has been in the business of making luggage since 1854, after all. But this season he took a different kind of journey. We are all living with this new dimension, he said afterward. We are all managing how to integrate these new notions of digital, virtual, and cyber with our real life. A conversation between technology and nature animated the new collection, his most audacious yet for the house, and one that had his fans chiming, The old Nicolas is back. The old Nicolas was a sci-fi obsessive and an experimentalist, qualities he subsumed early on during his tenure at LV that came rocketing to the fore here. His reference points were many: Wong Kar Wais 2046 and the anime series Evangelion came up backstage. The show itself started with an introduction to the video game Minecraft, which will be familiar to anyone with young children. Later, a sound clip from Tron: Legacy, the original of which was a favorite movie from Ghesquires own childhood, played. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer, Jeff Bridges intoned. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought Id never see, and then one day . . . I got in.  Ghesquires cyberpunks wore moto jackets and metal-embroidered skirts, laser-cut leathers and beaded knits that coded like armor, and spaceship-print pants. Leather gauntlets keyed a tough, aggressive attitude, but the designers vision was not a dystopic one. On the contrary. He was quick to point out that his materials looked high-tech but were actually not synthetics at all. What with the nailhead-embroidered peasant dresses, the crafty sweaters, and the festival-girl crop tops and shorts, Vuitton Spring looked a lot like a digital bohemia.$$Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema meets Marisa Berenson: As far as inspiration goes, thats a daring match. But for Luisa Beccaria, it was a successful one, at least in the garden, where the action for her Spring collection took place. It was a quite literal celebration of flower poweror an homage to a horticultural obsession. Billowy dresses bloomed with a lavish abundance of lilacs, roses, carnations, irises, hydrangeas, tulips, violets, cornflowers, periwinkles, cyclamens. Printed or embroidered in exquisite appliqus, they called to mind From Marie Antoinette's Garden, a recently published tome that praised the encyclopedic love that the French queen had for all the flowery specimens she tried to grow at the Petit Trianon, her pastoral retreat. Ever the romantic, Beccaria indulged her passion for long, ethereal gowns in wispy organza, lace, and chiffon: They had a prairie-chic spirit spiced up with a hint of folklore. Seventies bohemian silhouettes added a fresh spin to an ultrafeminine lineup of Empire-waisted frothy dresses with bouffant sleeves and coquette dcolletages. Wide-brimmed straw hats and languid floral scarves completed the bucolic look. The crowd of posh mothers and daughters, part of Beccarias loyal family-and-friends audience, looked very pleased, ready to order dresses that would be perfect for weddings in historical Tuscan villas, or tea parties in manicured gardens.$$To hear Lutz Huelle speak about his clothes is to be on the receiving end of all sorts of mini revelations. To wit: I like that something appears sexy because the person inside it decides it is going to be sexy. The supporting evidence: a trench coat or gray jersey tunic that could be unzipped from the shoulder down the arm. Or else hell consider how a garment might exist in a fixed seductive state of sliding off the body; this he did by suspending the core of black parka from diamant straps, flipping its raison dtre from outerwear to evening attire. Huelle operates from the premise that his designs need to end up being worn; otherwise, as he puts it, Whats the point? But his application of elasticized seaming to alter volumes, or the flapper fringing spilling forth from a boxy blazer also backed up his belief in eccentric simplicity. There were other indications throughout the Spring collection that this under-the-radar Paris-based designer studies construction without overthinking it. A dress pleated from neckline to hemline was bookended with circular denim sleeves; the result was slouchy yet flattering. If the pliant meshakin to citrus-fruit nettingseemed less essential than other pieces, it also layered the looks with unexpected edge. Speaking of unexpected, Huelle arrived at his final looks by accident upon realizing that the sheer perimeter of an embroidered sample made for a dynamic overleaf. He loved the idea so much that he tacked an oversize square of black silk onto the front of a white T-shirt dress. How easy, how right.$$In the age of diffusion lines and fast-fashion collaborations, where designers are brands and celebrities in their own right, Lyn Devon is a breath of fresh air. Despite having been in business for 10 years (an accomplishment in and of itself) and enjoying a loyal customer base, Devon is far from a household name. And thats just fine. She prefers to stay small, focusing on longtime private clients, whom she often hosts in her atelier, housed in a cozy Upper East Side town house. It suits me, she said during an appointment. I like having a mom-and-pop vibe. Devons design aestheticwhich she describes as elegant, put-together clothes her clients, who tend to fall between the ages of 35 and 65, can throw on and then forget aboutis as quietly powerful as her business strategy. This season she took inspiration from origami and traditional Japanese dress to surprising, if subtle, effect. Paper-thin dresses and tunics were hand-painted by Japanese artist Ken-Ichi Takahashi with botanical and pastoral scenes, and the designer introduced a gorgeous pleated hakama pant in khaki and dusty pink. Most items in the collection were unlined, to emphasize a certain weightlessness and ease of dress. For Spring, Devon said, she thought the idea of tying yourself in felt romantic, and so several of her dresses and coats came with a long ropelike belt that could be left off or wrapped around the waist. It gives the wearer some autonomy, she noted. A washed silk coatsomewhere between a robe and a trenchwas a prime example of Devons sweet spot, the kind of effortlessly chic piece women on either end of her core age spectrum will fall in love with.$$The unrelenting pace of fashion can make it feel a bit like a circus, so why not channel that into a collection inspired by trapeze artists, tightrope walkers, and other high-flying acts? M Missoni is one of the few brands that would go for such playful inspiration; its signatures include Lurex, unexpected color combinations, and ribbed knitswhich, taken together, can lend itself to circus iconography. Plus, M loves a theme: Last season it was all about Texas, while other past references have ranged from Shanghai to Little Red Riding Hood, done with a wink and plenty of sparkle every time. Some of this seasons updates were bold and exaggerated, like high ruffled collars (evoking Pierrot clown costumes), lion prints, and graphic, swirling shapes inspired by big-top tents. Elsewhere, the whimsical theme was a bit more subduedsee the rainbow-striped jumpsuit, bow tie details, and color-blocked macram skirt. For those who cant quite get behind the ringmaster connotations, though, you cant beat M Missonis classic knits. Clingy sweater dresses and ribbed wide-leg pants in shades of lime, fuchsia, and lavender would make familiar yet fresh wardrobe additionsespecially if you buy the star-printed sneakers to match.$$For Marcia Patmos, everything always goes back to travel: The ability to seamlessly unpack ones life in a different place is a central concept of the brand. Her past collections have referenced far-flung locales like Uzbekistan and Japan, but this season Patmos trained her eye a little closer to home, drawing upon summer nights spent in the Hamptons and Montauk. Imagining the kind of thing youd want to pull on as the air grows cooler at the beach, Patmos created an array of cozy transitional pieces, like a chunky cardigan scarf worn around the shoulders with two deep pockets, and a poncho-like contraption that read as a dress and could be worn over a bathing suit or a full outfit. Patmos is not a girly girl, but she wanted to incorporate ruffles into the collection, partially because she had let her imagination stray slightly to Cuba. She did so in the least twee way possible: on a slouchy gray cardigan and the sleeves of a white T-shirt. She also made a good case for knitwear for eveningan open-knit metallic tank with a fringed hem was a standout. Its the kind of thing that will work even if the only island you inhabit next summer is Manhattan.$$Why mess with success? Under the direction of Somsack Sikhounmuong, Madewell has proven itself to be J.Crews most solid bet in the face of financial troubles. With the designer shifted over to improve the fortunes of the big sister brand this summer, new Madewell creative director Joyce Lee has stayed his winning course in her first outing for the label (a Madewell vet of seven years, she worked closely with Sikhounmuong before his decampment to J.Crew). It was a little sweeter, perhaps, but whats arguably most remarkable about Madewell is its knack for conjuring up a convincingly familiar quality in spanking-new, mass-market clothing. Plenty of the styles here looked as if they had seen a road trip or two, or at the very least were ready-made for making memories in. Consider unexpected vintage touches, like custom embroidery (Springs high-waisted flares plus cheeky cherry-red script is a combo that will be hard to beat) or the cosmic cowboyesque stitching on the back of a fatigue jacket. All that 70s-hued bohemia found a foil in girlish pieces such as striped rompers and frocks edged in broderie anglaise. But perhaps most charming (and savvy) of all was Lees choice to introduce collaborative styles, including price-friendly patchworked jeans in partnership with insider-y favorite B-Sides.$$You can take the Kitsun girl out of Parisdrop her down in Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Manhattan, saybut you cant take Paris out of the Kitsun girl. The Spring images suggest she has ended up in some sort of Dadaist dream, a desert locale care of Pierpaolo Ferrari, where mountains of gold foil rise from the sand and red doors lead to nowhere. In Look 9, in which she is eclipsed by a pair of enormous lips, the grid-printed dress-parka combo reads unquestionably Kitsun. Ditto the floral-brocade bandeau and high-waisted shorts. The womenswear is reliably gamine that way. A jersey Teddy jacket and pochette bearing familiar block lettering are true to character; the mini empire of Maison Kitsun has risen off the backs (and fronts) of those eager to sport sweatshirts that spread the word. But the generously proportioned dress, midi skirt, and white suit in Looks 6, 18, and 20, respectively, are evidence that the brand understands it must grow up if it is to grow out. If eternally youthful cocreator Gildas Loac speaks as confidently about the overall directionincluding international customers and store expansionsas he does fabrications, he can also cherry-pick pieces that show off how far Maison Kitsuns clothes have come. Mixed-knit gauges and sweatshirts shaved down to create a mesh-like pattern, for example, represent ideas that will continue to be developed. Desert theme or not, the collarless utility jacket in slubbed cotton, Japanese indigo leisurewear, and patterned tie-front sundresses are instantly likable items that refresh a wardrobe without going to extremes.$$A girl in a giant green beehive with silver petalpainted eyes, wearing a 50s three-quarter-sleeved clutch coat and a pair of pointy white pumps with bulbous molded heels and toting a capacious white bag was the opener. She marked the takeoff point for John Gallianos most rounded and product-filled Maison Margiela collection so far. Lo-fi, sci-fi was his tagline for it: words that came via email rather than straight from the designers mouth, as he doesnt appear at the end of his shows nowone of Margielas house traditions he surely values. But this was a wholly Galliano trip, not an old-school Margiela one. He made a delightful merge of vintage-y eccentricity, Japanese geisha styling, and colorthemes that have constantly been part of Gallianos design territory from the beginning, of course. The good news was that, despite the extreme teased updos and his casting of several androgynous boys to wear dresses, this was not one of his excursions into a fantasia of old: He had grounded it in a slew of believably wearable clothes, for the first time since he arrived at Margiela. At one end of the spectrum, there was crystal embroidery resembling dangly earrings smothering a mint green 50s coat; at the other, a pragmatic tailored grass green suit with skinny trousers and a body jacket. In between, plenty of skirts that might make us think differently about narrow, just-above-the-ankle proportions, maybe worn with fitted peplumed tops. And then, for evening and events, numerous dresses in extraordinarily subtle combinations of kimono-inspired prints and tintsas well as a glimpse of a gold satin bias-cut slip dress of the kind the designer brought into fashion in the 90s. Galliano is back on his game againa relief for those who supported him in the first place and a thrill for another generation whove grown up to see him through new eyes.$$Imagine you could temporarily step away from your life and escape to some far-flung corner of the world where a lover awaits; what would you want to wear? Rabih Kayrouz offered this as the narrative for a wholly desirable lineup that did not require a backstory to leave a lingering impression. He bookended the collection with two very different dresses in the same papery, ribbed white organza. To start, a generous caftan punctuated with placket and side pockets just barely tacked down; to finish, a floor-grazing gown free of finery. In between were traces of tailoring that imbued the looks with assured grace, from a jumpsuit that folded and flushed around the body to smoking jackets furnished with a fluted overlay offering hands a place to hide.  The seductive touches were just as tacit: slender slits, extended arm openings that converged at the waist, or a double set of dress straps framing the dcolletage. Similarly, the djellaba-inspired robes and fluid draping transmitted the weightlessness of a consummated love affairthe frisson of the body at its freest. Suddenly, theres nothing to restrict, said Kayrouz backstage. Its very pure this time. Arguably, it was also expressivea motif of rainbow ribbons projected pure optimism, while a green hue that evoked antique banker lamps suggested his muse wasnt all that concerned about staying inconspicuous. The fact that the collection unfurled to the soulful songs of Millie Jackson struck a chord; in the absence of the actual escape, these clothes were channeling the longing. They almost made the heart achein a good way.$$Resort was Declan Kearneys first outing as the new creative director of Maiyet. It was a breakthrough moment for the brand. A veteran of Alexander Wang and Jason Wu, Kearney injected Maiyet with a fresh vitality, turning out clothes with a high desirability factor. The pea coat in particular made the top of a few editors wish lists, but there were plenty of other great pieces to wear, too. Today marked Kearneys debut runway show, as well as Maiyets first in New York after a few years in Paris, and retailer turnout was high.  The brainchild of Kristy Caylor, Paul Van Zyl, and Daniel Lubetzky, Maiyet is an American-born company with a global perspective, one that enlists artisans from around the world to weave silk or do beadwork and reinvests in the artisans communities. Its a noble mission. The thing is, women shop with their heart, not their conscience. Kearneys Resort clothes appealed to both. He aimed high for Spring. Amelia Earhart and NASAs unsung mathematician Katherine Johnson gave the collection a utilitarian backbone. Arizonas Antelope Canyon inspired the striated swoosh motif that appeared on a few loose shifts. Knits were a highlight, especially a chunky ribbed T-shirt dress that was accessorized by a Bolivian macram scarf and a tunic-length plaid knit sweater worn over a hammered silk slip dress, one of the shows dominant silhouettes. The burnout velvet numbers at the end were luminous. But overall the collection suffered a bit for its washed-out palette and felt a bit flat. If Kearney failed to raise pulses quite as high as he did with his first effort, he has the time and, more importantly, the talent to raise the bar.$$Eh, whats the point? That, in a nutshell, was the thought galvanizing Maki Ohs latest collection. Lagos-based designer Amaka Osakwe likes to draw on unexpected themes, but a tribute to human futility may be her most far-fetched yet. Osakwe was thinking about Sisyphus, she said, and Camuss quote, Our life is built on the hope for tomorrow, yet tomorrow brings us closer to death, and the Yoruban trick, among parents, of sending their bored kids around to nearby homes in search of arodan, a thing that doesnt actually exist. The Almodvar film Talk to Her and the karuwai courtesans of northern Nigeria were bouncing around Osakwes headspace as well, making for a rich brew. Which, in the end, was the point: Life may be futile, Osakwes collection posited, but it is also deliciously full. Osakwes engagement with existential absurdism freed her up. There was a new sense of looseness in the silhouettes, witnessed particularly in Osakwes terrific, fluid trousers, and a refreshing playfulness found in the collections rather daffy approach to embellishment and print. Scalloped edges, thread embroidery, a dash of distressed denim, graphic appliqu, feathers, fringe, Lurex meshOsakwe had at it, coercing coherence from the mix with her innate sense of discipline. She gave herself permission to experiment, in other words, but the overall effect was far from slapdash. And a few of her flourishes had a philosophical weight one doesnt often discover in clothes: Note, for instance, the indigo teardrop print, which, when you peered inside the tears, revealed an underprint of delicate flowers. Osakwe is a designer with an urgent need for her clothes to mean something; this time out she encompassed that meaning in looks that were her most wearable yet. Why wear a relaxed, ruffled dress of geometric black broderie anglaise? Why not? Life is short. We take our pleasures where we find them.$$Backstage before his show, Manish Arora introduced Bunnyla, a floppy-eared fashionista who would be making several appearances on the catwalk, in some cases enrobed just like her model chaperones. The designer then revealed Bunnylas belly ring and the condoms tucked into her bejeweled briefs. For writers accustomed to finding young women in a state of undress, the sight of Arora enthusiastically lifting a stuffed toys skirt might have been a first. But he did this by way of explaining how the Spring collection marked a departure into adult territory. Why be pigeonholed into couture tracksuits for raver girls when he could stretch his wings with glamorous gypsy dresses for disco queens? Most noticeably, Arora swapped the moon boots for metallic platforms by Terry de Havilland and kept his lineup light on pants (the handful of mens looks notwithstanding). In turn, he went extra-heavy on full skirts in highlighter hues, shoulder- and midriff-bearing tops trimmed with laser-cut filmy fringes, and minidresses exploding with plastic flowers.  When asked why he pushed into a more feminine, arguably costumey register at exactly the moment that people are gravitating toward sport clothes, Arora joked, How much more could I do?, adding that he wasnt so much concerned about his customers maturing as elevating his psychedelic aesthetic to a new level of luxe. But by now youd think he might realize how easy it is to overdose, and past a certain point in the show, the groovy, folkloric buzz wore off. Luckily, he was saved by veteran model Debra Shaw, who brought a welcome dash of diva to his decadence. Bunnyla, meanwhile, will be multiplied many times over for retail.$$Mara Hoffman isnt afraid to take her inspirations literally. Willie Nelson was the starting point for her Spring collection, and you could sense it from the first look: Nelsons beloved song Blue Skies was playing, and the set was decorated with a bright sky backdrop that mirrored the models own sky-print suit. The girls even sported Nelsons signature waist-length braids, in case you didnt pick up on the reference. But the musician has a very particular take on Americana, which presented a new challenge for Hoffman, whose print-heavy collections are known for being exotic. She updated Levi's by embroidering them with cornstalks and experimented with classic shirting silhouettes, but she also made a point of casting diverse models to represent Americas rich blend of cultures. What really felt new for Hoffman, though, were the tomboy looks. Slouchy overalls, boxy suits with bolo ties, and button-down shirts with popped collars were some of the most masculine clothes shes done, but she was drawing from her own personal style: My collections are really feminine, but more often than not Im in vintage jeans and a shirt buttoned all the way up, she said. Of course, that can be really sexy: Even Hoffmans most covered-up propositions, like the closing looka sheer, star-embroidered shirtdress layered over matching wide-leg pantsfelt alluring in an unexpected way.$$New York Fashion Week began and ended with giant spectacles. Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy show was contemplative, or at least set out to be; Marc Jacobss tonight was a clamorous, exuberant affair. Both got the public involved: Its still hard to score access, but the shows are less and less an insular, insiders-only experience.  Circumstance forced Jacobs out of his usual venuesometimes the Army needs the Lexington Avenue Armory. He said he jumped at the chance to show in the Ziegfeldas a native New Yorker, he grew up seeing movies at the famous theaterand that the innovative setup was custom-fit to the special location. Marc Jacobs: One Night Only! blazed the marquee. Inside, there was popcorn and fountain drinks; cigarette girls offered candy; and ushers dispensed Playbills (not a mixed metaphor, the original Ziegfeld showed musicals, not movies) as they led celebrities like Bette Midler, Winona Ryder, Sandra Bernhard, and Sofia Coppola to their seats. Outside, models including Bella Hadid, Guinevere van Seenus, Emily Ratajkowski, and the singer Beth Ditto walked the length of a red carpet that stretched for half a block, stopping for a picture at the Marc Jacobs step-and-repeat, before they made their way up the stairs and into the theater, where we watched the street-side happenings on the Ziegfelds giant screen.  The show was a love letter to the movies, Americas greatest invention; to America itself; and to a New York City thats all but vanished. The Ziegfeld is the largest surviving single-screen theater in Manhattan, and trumpeter Brian Newman and his band played punk progenitors the New York Dollss 1973 song Trash. Nostalgia is the most powerful force in Jacobss work. This season he indulged his insatiable, catholic tendencies: High culture (Maria Callas as Medea), low (showgirls), and things in between (Janet Leigh in Psycho) mingled on the runway. You couldnt help but think that Andy Warhol would have appreciated it, not least of all because some of the prints were suggestive of the Pop artists silkscreens.  Its the kind of collection that will reward an up-close lookdense with detail and hidden meanings, and totally irresistible.$$The entertainment multi-hyphenate Marcelo Burlon naturally didnt opt for a static presentation to showcase his burgeoning brand, County of Milan. Having sprouted from a T-shirt line into a label stocked in hundreds of global stores, his womenswear now includes leather outerwear, Italian embroidery, and allover printed tailoring. And for Spring, the show producer, events planner, musician, artist, and social media magnet channeled his disparate skills into the evenings artistic pursuita dance performance choreographed by Kirikoo Des. His tribe of dancers (which included a voguing champion from the House of Ninja and a French Lido dancer) were clad in County of Milan garb and writhed to a soundtrack composed by Burlon and Davide Squillace. It was an arresting sight, especially in a darkened theater, one the Argentine creative director said he used to frequent when he dreamed of becoming a dancer. The collections motifseagles, snakes, and graphics taken from a Lamborghini and Burlon collaboration moved to the beat, with a 3-D projection playing in the foreground. It was at times awkward when some of the dancers yelled out, but still such a welcome change from the usual show format. Also unusual: Despite the fact that the Milan designer has captured an Instagram following and the fact that many well-known photographers were in attendance, few showgoers were unable to take their eyes off the choreography and the clothes. Applause instead of phone photography at a runway show? A rare sight these days, indeed. Afterward, flicking through his lookbook, Burlon said he specifically chose to incorporate the poncho into his Spring collection. While elsewhere it may be considered a winter garment, in his native country the blanket-like cloak is used to fend off the sun; in gold-embossed silk, it is bound to appeal, as are his new buyer-friendly denim separates (the line sells at Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue). Motifs such as wings were taken up a notch from allover prints to metallic embroidery on the back of leather jackets, silk tops, and even slides. It was a smart act to follow for the casual crowd.$$As any department store shopper can attest, the biggest problem with designers lower-priced labels is that many fail to capture the magic you see on the runway of their main line. For Marchesa Notte, the sister collection of Marchesa, that usually isn't the case. Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig launched Notte back in 2007 to give their couture customers slightly less-fantastical options for garden parties, weddings, and other nonred carpet affairs. With a more approachable price point to matchdresses range from $800 to $1,000Notte has also become a go-to for high school proms. Girls who are still dreaming about the bird-inspired, Jordan almondcolored fairy-tale gowns that hit the Marchesa runway a few days ago will delight in the fact that Notte pulled inspiration from the same places. The big difference was in the silhouettes, which were just a bit simpler. They lent themselves equally well to Marchesa propers rose gold embroideries, petal appliqus, and tasteful cutouts. An added bonus: Most of these dresses were relatively ageless, save for a blush A-line minidress with tulle overlay and life-size flower embellishments, which would look particularly sweet on younger girls with sneakers or gladiator sandals.$$They dont refer to fashions flock for nothing: Keren Craig and Georgina Chapman looked to the skies for inspiration for their Spring collection and found it slightly closer to earth in a botanical menagerie of caged birds. These were represented by fluffy feathered skirts, 3-D embroideries of flora and fauna, artfully arched modesty-preserving wings, and colorful dcollet accents poking out from the bodice of sleek corsets on red carpetready gowns.  Sheer boudoir-inspired evening looks in black and nude Chantilly lace provoked further rumination on the caged bird concept. The sweeping, ombr-dyed tiered tulle trains in shades of sorbet caused a riot of Instagram snaps among a front row section occupied by a gaggle of Disney Channel starlets, eager to scrum for their debut in the larger celebrity ecosystem. (On the other end of the spectrum and the runway was Bette Midler, to whom a thickly jeweled, sheer-shouldered gown in deep navy was of significantly more interest.) And what else is Marchesa for, if not exquisitely rendered red carpet moments for ones own inner Disney princess? That a few of the dresses left some runway detritus (a fistful of feathers here, petals of tulle there)turning a devoted Harvey Weinstein into a quick one-man clean-up crewonly proved that even the brightest peacocks among us have to return to reality now and again. And you know what they say about birds of a feather.$$Since his earliest days on the Milan runway, Marco de Vincenzo has distinguished himself by his use of embellishments. He has a fine eye for the way color, pattern, and texture can highlight and accentuate a womans body. Up until now hes taken inspiration, when it was obvious at all, from his base in Rome, but a recent trip to Japan inspired todays exploration of Eastern motifs. The red disc of Japans flag appeared on a couple of tops, and Mt. Fuji featured on one or two others. De Vincenzo used silken kimono fabrics for a handful of coats that did a nice job of straddling the day-night divide.  Owing to his decorative tendencies, De Vincenzos eveningwear has received the lions share of the presss attention. Picking up where his Fall collection left off, he made a strong effort here to broaden his before-dark offerings. A fanciful kind of girl will appreciate the outfit that combined an over-printed silver leather jean jacket, a rainbow-striped collared shirt, and a lavender pencil skirt in a squiggle motif that was echoed on the metal heels of strappy sandals. De Vincenzo was fairly brazen about mismatching patterns here, and it totally paid off.  It was with some of the eveningwear that he stumbled. A wisp of a dress with a single breast in ruffle-swathed optic lace probably shouldnt have made it out of the atelier. The underwire detailing on other dresses proved almost as distracting. Elsewhere though, the tinkering paid off. Chiffon shredded like confetti read like fur from a distance; in the hand it was almost preternaturally light. In a bid for the minimalists in the room, De Vincenzo showed midi-length gilets and flared pants in the fabric, in monochrome black and white, but it was a true marvel on a coat that shaded from black at the shoulders through white, red, and blue to a deep yellow band at the hem.$$No matter what the latest trends are dictating, the concept of high-low juxtaposition will always be in style. Marissa Webb has built her business around contrasts like masculine and feminine, hard and soft, edgy and sweet. For Spring, Webb didnt veer too far from those signatures, but her inspiration lent a fresh, genuinely new angle. After flipping through old 1950s photographs of her grandfather Albert decked out in military fatigues beside her grandmother, who favored prim dresses, she realized how great those uniforms would look mixed together. The result was a collection rich with texture, color, and volume.  Instead of adhering to one specific vibe, Webb tends to play with mini themes throughout her collections; here, there were neon orange lace dresses, grungy plaids, and a pale pink skinny suit, which offered a slicker take on Le Smoking. But the best looks featured some kind of vest: a plaid-and-lace dress with a leather pinafore-style vest, or a swishy floral gown topped with an abbreviated army jacket. From a distance, the vests and dresses appeared to be fused together for one easy piece, but shoppers will be able to buy them separately come next year. That kind of styling trick calls to mind Webbs career-defining stint at J.Crewarguably the harbinger of the modern mash-up lookbut perhaps well see more of those mixed references at her Banana Republic presentation this Saturday.$$As fashion formulas go, heaping playful decorative motifs onto a template of featherlight streetwear seems promising. And it certainly succeeded for Markus Lupfer, who this season presented a confident, tight variation of his it-just-works recipe. His theme was so out of left field as to seem arbitrary: flowers and Mexican wrestlers. As he explained it, I envisaged this hard desert land. Then it starts raining and fields of flowers bloom. Chrysanthemum embroideries rustled around illustrations of ham-thighed, colorfully masked wrestlers on T-shirts and sweatshirts made of French lace, or black organza skirts, shorts, and bombers. Chokers and vulcanized skater shoes were garlanded with more blooms in beads, pins, and sequins. An appliqu wave rippled across more organza, while Lupfers strongest traditional evening proposal was a rose-gold flower-heaped fil coupe shift with a layered underskirt. Printed drawstring silk-mix track pants, shorts, and tees, meanwhile, were the pieces you could imagine buying and wearing straight out of the store. Imposing sometimes-borderline OTT decorations onto elevated versions of pieces that so many young women wear every day is a pretty sweet niche, and Lupfer has clearly made it his own.$$Mentally undressing models is not the usual activity of a fashion reviewer. Were here to evaluate clothes, not bodies. But at Marni, the mind couldnt help inquiring: What was happening under all those triangular, asymmetrical layers? The suspicionhope, evenwas that it might be a simple, anchoring slip, as the back views of some of Consuelo Castiglionis looks gave a glimpse of satin and straps. From the front, the rigid leather and ponyskin camisole-like aprons and tunics of her first outfits seemed a clue that she was presenting an abstracted thought about the key garment of the season. Later on, the shape reappearedat times as long dresses in oversize sport mesh, other times as plain wool structures with geometric chunks cut out of the skirtsand always amongst assemblages of other garments. That adds up to a lot to put on, all at once. Marni is a brand with a woman-friendly reputation for color and print, and this collection did have plenty of it. Castiglioni proved her eye for the right orange red, tobacco brown, and bottle green, which few designers would dare place in the same collection as egg yolk yellow, primary blue, and shell pink. But it was with her giant leaf prints on graceful elongated tunics over fluid trousers that the collection really hit its stride. It was then that the anxious viewer stopped worrying about what it would feel like to manage all those semi-garments and began to appreciate the chic neo-moderne metal and dangly acetate earrings and chunky lacquer bracelets that are such a Marni draw. No one will ever want this brand to go minimalist, but when Castiglioni shows a little less, she makes her customers want her more.$$Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida arent abrasive, rebellious-seeming people at allif anything, they seem pleasantly down-to-earth (Marta) and almost shy (Paulo). But these two, apart from being incredibly hard-working, are also quietly obstinate about going their own way.  From the beginning, they took what seemed an extreme path with their super-shredded denim, in direct opposition to what some young Londoners call Downing Street fashion (i.e., the tendency toward a pretty party dress), and kept their sights on doing clothes for real street. As Marta Marques often says, the benchmark they always use is whether her 22-year-old sister Sofia finds their clothes acceptable, and whether normal girls can find the prices within the realms of affordability. Well, the extent to which that stubborn luxury-resistant policy has paid off can be seen not just in the innumerable Marques  Almeida pieces in evidence on the Fashion Week crowds, but also in the influence of this Portuguese couples work has had on mainstream manufacturing. If 2015 is the year a pair of ripped-knee jeans made its way into every girls wardrobe, thats thanks to Marta and Paulo. Which is why the great and the good of the fashion firmaments of many nations battled through torrential rain to a north London warehouse to witness what Marques  Almeida is offering this spring. Answer: more of the same destroyed-yet-practical glamour for street, bar, festival, and pub. Maybe its the combination of the designers Latin genes and their 90s-revering generational taste that made them come up with ruffles (that wave thats rippling across fashion right now) and transparency. In their book, though, the ruffle-fronted shirt has gone wild and raw-edged, roughly chopped into dense halter-bibs, while the flounces run across sheer chiffon or down into shaggy-fringed denim skirts. If at times the deconstructionism got a bit too skimpy, things took a turn for the far more interesting when the couple started taking on new fabricsslubby-beige linen and burlapand working in a crackly-surfaced patent leather and chocolate brown suede. There was a traily grunge-by-way-of-Galliano feeling and a tinge of 90s romanticism going on as well, butrememberthese designers are not the kind of people who spend their nights partaking of any louche party scene. As realists, they are carefully deepening their brand by simply reproducing their most-liked shapes (jeans, oversize biker jackets, halters) in different fabrics. Clever.$$Post-show, Martin Grants supporters congratulated him on what they felt was his best collection yet. Not that they were wrong, but it prompts the question: based on what? Heres one theory: It felt thoughtfully composed. Grant picked up where his pre-collection left off by reintroducing the linen-wool blend that he uses in place of denim, as well as the silk organza feathery tinsel, aka his summer fur. And once again, he barely left the confines of black, warm white, and navy. The printsa paint splotch and a medley of stripeswere created by hand and counterbalanced the rough-hewn silk and double-face cotton with rhythmic lift. Theres a chance that Grants women offered such unanimous praise because he left out the pieces that, in previous seasons, existed to attract younger customers to the label. Instead, he seems to have realized that neckline emphasis is good, waistline emphasis is better, and slimming emphasis is best of allno matter the age. Furthermore, the eveningwear optionsfrom chemise and ball skirt to elongating jumpsuitoozed urbane chic. Ultimately, Grant doesnt leave a writer with much to reportno theme, inspiration, muse, or talking pointswhich might give the false impression that the collection was light on ideas. Was it his best? Perhaps only Grant is equipped to judge. But judging against his recent endeavors, it was right up there.$$It is weirda sort of barely conceivable telescoping of timeto realize that Mary Katrantzou graduated from Central Saint Martins, M.A., in 2008 with precisely 10 shift dresses, each of them digitally printed with oversize images of jewelry (the evidence is in the archives of Vogue Runway). Well, look at her now, seven years on, filling the atrium on the Central Saint Martins campus with a large, immensely intricate body of work framed around Roma gypsy dress and cosmic stargazingall of it visible in a vast mirror that reflected the lineup into infinity. The G-forces exerted on any designer whose business has taken off so rapidlyKatrantzou sells around the world noware extreme. But the remarkable thing about her is how she has adapted over that time, always carefully paying attention to critical feedback as she speeds forward. After breaking new territory with digital trompe loeil prints, which all too swiftly became a widespread style throughout the fashion world, she turned away from her computer and went into handcrafted embellishment. When people criticized her for being a decorator, she moved on to experimenting with sculpted shape. And when the response to that hinted that her experiments might be getting too cumbersome, she came back with what she presented tonight: a collection that combined tiny flower prints, micro sequins, and metallic quilting in weightlessly fluttery forms. It is interestingmaybe even disturbingto wonder why so many designers in Europe have been thinking about the folkloric costume traditions of the peoples of the Balkans, Romania, Hungary, and farther east. Can it be that the consciousness of mass migrations in the daily news is ending up processed into floral prints and collaged patchworks on pretty, fashionable dresses? If so, then Katrantzou is not the only designer or label that has become porous to those subconscious influences. Mini-rose prints on a black background even turned up on the Topshop runway four hours before Katrantzous show and, before that, in many variations, in the British designer Stuart Veverss Coach collection in New York City last week. But Katrantzou, in her intelligent way, senses the danger of being boxed into a trend. In this outing, she also showed she can take on the challenge of proving shes able to design without print, without color, and without embroidery or texture. Her passage of pieces involving solid black material, cut with couture-like exactitude into A-line skirts and fit-and-flare coat silhouettes, was surprising yet instantly desirable. Compared with the clothes she was making when she came out of CSM, this collection bore almost no relation stylistically. The only link between the two is lodged in Katrantzous constantly self-challenging brain. And the intellectual result, whatever it might be, elevated this season to another plane.$$Summer may feel like a distant memory now, obscured by the fracas of fashion month, but the season came to vivid life in Maryam Nassir Zadehs latest offering. The designer imagined it as a series of distinct, personal chapters. The first was bright, open, and inspirational, colored by the time she spent traveling with her family in Italy; a heady vision of days in Palermo, Rome, Puglia, and Capri. But vacations always enda second chapter told the story of returning to New Yorks harsher, often tumultuous realities. Zadehs denouement lands somewhere in the middle: grounded in a life at home, and informed by the perspective of time abroad.  The designers Spring lineup was an organic expression of those ideas, not too beholden to plot. There is a certain intimacy that seems to mark Zadehs clothestheyre both familiar and uncanny. Take the gentle volume of a sculptural metallic organza bomber or crisp poplin dresses, which came unexpectedly tied, halterlike, at the neck. Ensembles were alternate strokes retro-beachy and rustic; likewise in palette, pops of lime and cherry red drew a sharp contrast to shades of blush and gold that recalled the gessoed walls of Zadehs summer travelsa lovely dissonance.  Still, for many MNZ shoppers, the biggest news here will be the exciting trials in reworked denim. A pair of pants, patchworked in varying washes from cornflower on up to indigo, will be a sure sellout, ditto a softly fraying jacket made from a pair of jeans.$$Nautical has been in style in summer at least since Coco Chanel set sail around the Mediterranean with her lover, the Duke of Westminster, in the 20sand even she cant claim to have invented it, since earlier examples of sailor collars and boaters go back to Edwardian times. Why else would we automatically call a certain shade of dark blue navy? So for a purveyor of classics such as Max Mara, the theme is a natural and obvious one. And theres nothing wrong with obvious! Faced with the oceans of mucked-about and difficult clothes that are proffered as fashion, how astonishingly nice would it be to know there was one store where perfectly cut sailor pants, striped Breton T-shirts and jerseys, peacoats, and the like are reliably available? Max Maras creative director, Ian Griffiths, should not fear that this could be a boring missionthe fact is that non-bonkers, non-branded classics can actually also be synonymous with cool. In his presentation, there were plenty of garments that might fall under the classification of great genericsthe sort of clothes that could live with you for years. He threw in a couple of novelty notesthe star-pattern knits (no doubt inspired by officers epaulets) and prints of ropes on silk piecesand he couldnt hold back on some quirky styling, extending the sleeves of stripy tees and doing up jackets and coats on the wrong button,  la 80s John Galliano. As a matter of fact, Griffiths really doesnt need to try to dress up Max Maras classics in that sort of way at all. One day, he should see what happens if the company simply marches out 30 variations of a single garmentfar from narrowing his audience, he might just convince the young as well as the middle-aged and senior among us. After all, the democracy of chic has no age limit.$$One thing you may not have known until now: Sarah Burton, in addition to her role as creative director of Alexander McQueen, is also in charge of McQ, the labels contemporary line. McQ was brought back from the licensing world five years ago, and has steadily smoothened and shaped itself as McQueens sportier complement, with an underlying war cry of corrupting the everyday. With a focus on New York in the late 70s to the mid-80sthe no wave art movement, especiallyBurton and her team came up with a collection that was both kitschy and hard, invigorated by graphic elements like polka dots, silvery metallic leathers (even in dress form), and chain accents. As for the latter, Burton suggests wearing them as suspenders, belts, or necklaces, or all at the same time, and layering them with abandoneven over something as lo-fi as an outsize white T-shirt and an ivory-hued skirt. The strongest pieces here were the polka-dot numbers, namely so in the form of a silk georgette long-sleeved, floor-scraping dress, punked out with yet another chain. Likewise with rose lace options, these all held a touch of the macabre romanticism that Burton has woven into McQueen proper. It would be nice, actually, to see more of this element as McQ continues to develop.$$New Yorkbased Melitta Baumeister considered scrawling legible writingcatchphrases, evenacross her glossy vinyl bonded garments before settling on black spray-paint tagging and white chalk paint. I like the illegal aspectthat something beautiful can be defaced and appear destroyed, she said from a rental apartment in the east stretch of Paris. Surface patterning, no matter how unruly, marks new territory for the young designer, who has become best known for using slick, stiff, and spongy materials that arent traditionally wearable. On that count, shes progressed, too: For Spring, Baumeister used second-skin viscose Lycra to offset her exaggerated volumes. But lest this sound like shes conceding to retail imperatives, the details were as fetishist as everthe bodysuits zippers ran from nape of neck all the way around to the front of the crotch. And she figured out how to affix nipple ringtype hardware to a top (and elsewhere, to coat closures) so that people can experience the shock value sans pain or permanence. Simply by keeping strict about her silhouettes (hey, its all relative), Baumeister is showing maturity. But for all the checks, there remain a few imbalances. The back of a padded apron dress consisted only of a harness. Add a pair of pants or skirt and the front becomes maternity wear. In a perfect world, Baumeister would prefer her looks be worn in full, an admission thats equal parts understandable and unrealistic. In February, one or two of them will be featured in BeautyCooper Hewitt Design Triennial.  Her work will fit right into an exhibition setting. But its clear that fitting in has never been her goal.$$At Michael Kors Collection, Spring 2016 had a curious but possibly telling dichotomy running through itminimal androgyny in neutrals on the one hand and flowery womanliness in pretty colors on the other. In a way, it looked as if two collections had been chopped up and merged together, so that, to quote from the show notes, you had, for example, Lisa wearing Look 13, white linen gauze duster, white tissue linen tank, white linen gauze utility pant, followed by Lindsey in Look 14, a lapis poppy-print georgette dress with frayed floral embroidery. Michael Kors is one of the great American storytellers of New York fashion, and it scarcely needs to be reiterated that his narrative about a serene, discreetly moneyed, and always optimistic lifestyle is enthusiastically (and lucratively) received far beyond the United States. Would those followers be puzzled by the two strands running through this show? Unlikely, for both come from the traditional American playbookstripped-down-90s, utilitarian, go-to-work tailoring, and decorative dresses for entertaining and special occasions. In other words, this was a collection that covered the social waterfront, with everything from Korss classic tan suede trenches and billowy poet-sleeved blouses with drawstring necklines to an evening shirtdress with vertically inserted strips of sheer Chantilly lace, all of which looked good. But perhaps the underlying contrasts between those two aesthetics is also an unconscious reflection of two rival themes that have emerged this week at the New York showsthe celebration of cleaned-up grunge-era style, which is everywhere, and the newer backlash toward sophisticated, pulled-together feminine dressing weve seen from Peter Copping at Oscar de la Renta. As it happens, with his poppy prints and fil coupe fabrics, Kors was on almost exactly the same page as Copping, so no matter how his customer feels like playing it come next season, Kors has her covered.$$A return to nature is already a big theme for Spring 16, but Millys Michelle Smith was perhaps the least likely designer to go there. Over the past few years, her collections have been all about sporty fabrics, graphic colors, and structured silhouettes, so Spring was almost free-spirited in comparison. Smith said she wanted to capture the ephemeral feeling of a summer romance, but not in a clich way (read: no billowing chiffon or girly florals). Instead, she relied on texture to give familiar, minimal garments a new sense of ease.  Denim linen felt particularly fresh for Milly. A strapless, no-frills gown would be just as chic with flat mules or strappy stilettos, and thats exactly the kind of versatility women are looking for these days. Asymmetrical skirts in fluttery silk cady also fit the day-to-night bill, as did a range of crispy poplin shirts and dresses. When you really stopped to think about it, though, this collection was more about an attitude than anything else. Sure, you could see a beach sunset in the rich papaya-and-gold jacquard pieces, and plunging necklines exposed a sensual flash of skin. But it was also interesting to see the way Smith layered a miniskirt over an extra-long shirtdress or how a bias-cut slip dress floated around the body just so. Its those quieter details that added up to the chicest real-life looksthey left room for interpretation.  Backstage before the show, Smith said it all felt like entirely new territory for her. But what designer doesnt love a challenge? With sport references on the sharp decline, this looked like a promising new direction for Milly.$$Mira Mikati set the bar high at her debut last season, thanks, in part, to a cameo collaboration with artist Darcel Disappoints (Craig Redman). For her follow-up, she recruited Kaws (Brian Donnelly). The three special-edition, multicolored varsity jackets they did together favor Mikatis buoyant vibe more than the grayscale angst of Kawss Companion character. Zoom out to the full collection and theres no escaping the fact that fun is her driving forceand, for Spring, a fantasy road trip across America. At a presentation space filled with cactus balloons and bold city signage, she showed off how workmanship and a personalized touch elevated her ideas beyond the realm of camp. Do not disturb me appeared laser cut and outlined in embroidery on the back of a cotton linen car coat, rather than simply printed. A comic cityscape pattern inspired by a coloring book featured crayon contributions from her children.  If drawing from Santa Fe and New York in equal measure risks a disparate representation of styling souvenirs (from bohemian suede and a crochet poncho to a shrunken blazer and sleeveless trench), the predominance of whiteright down to the sneakersbalanced all of the layering like a gallery backdrop. Indeed, the progression of the narrativefrom Wake up for Fall to Sleep all day for Springsuggests an outward expression of Mikatis inner dialogue. But as much as the text sounds refreshingly unfiltered, design is a creative exercise in filtering, and to her credit, she creates clothes, not wearable art. Of course, at the rate shes going, she might just convince the likes of Murakami or Space Invader to join in on the fun. Shes certainly sparked the desire to collect.$$For Spring 2016, Misha Nonoo presented a series of eminently wearable, tomboyish coveralls, flirty A-line skirts and culottes in all shades of rusty poppy and chalk white denim, and breezy and bright pajama-style suiting. There were baby blue cropped T-shirts embroidered with in-jokes (Darling, Naughty Square, So Real Surreal); breezy white summer separates, and swinging bell-sleeved knit frocks, and all took inspiration from no less than the Bauhaus movement, minimalism by way of Donald Judd, and what Nonoo called a 1960s, 1970s cool girl vibe.  Honestly, everyone does the same thing in our industry, so how do you stand out? asked Nonoo, who chose to opt out of the New York show schedule and instead debut her designs in a one-two wallop of a freshly created Instagram account as well as on the backs of a bevy of handpicked fashion influencers, from Lena Dunham and Olivia Palermo to New York City Ballet principal dancer Sara Mearns and Linda Rodin, who will post selfies in ensembles from the collection on their own accounts today. When you have most of your front row built out of people with huge social media followings and what you really want is for them to go to your show, take a picture, and share it with their followers, why dont you just get to that point first? asked Nonoo, who shot her parochial schoolinspired box-pleat pinafores, graph-paper-checked shirtdresses, and grosgrain-trimmed jacquard sundresses at Pioneer Works in Red Hook, Brooklyn, orienting the results to a horizontal, wallpaper-style scroll (users will be directed to flip their iPhones) for the new account, and who estimates that the cumulative followers of her international band of influencers total somewhere around 8 million. (And without a single seating chart!) The thought, Nonoo explained, is that rather than have everyone come to her, shell go to where the action isin the steady grips and handbags of fashion editors, fans, and her customers. Ultimately its all about the asset in the first place, so if you can create even better assets, even more stylized assets, said Nonoo, then why not just do that? Its worth noting that she has recently found success going her own way, with the December launch of an in-house e-commerce site proving both fruitful and educational, insofar as connecting with the Misha Nonoo customer. Things are changing, the designer explained, doing this beautiful, very art-directed shoot in a space that I love, that I feel super-comfortable in, for me, its showing more about my brand and my collection and the environment and the ethos and the philosophy than 15 minutes on a runway. Only time will tell if her followers earn that designationbut its a heck of a start.$$Turns out, you really can go home again. For Spring 2016, Angela Missoni took her brand back to its roots: Sportswear! exclaimed the designer backstage before the show. Her boards were full of photographs of Maasai tribespeople (Africa being, as Missoni noted, the roots of humanity) and the graphic, street-centric work of the Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez, whose colorful, kinetic crosswalks inspired the runway. Yet the show was full of the bright, breezy, vibrant type of jet setready attire that has made the house iconic for decades.  The silhouette was long and lean, with narrow, sweeping cardigans paired with hot pants, fete-ready halter-neck dresses in vibrant metallic pleats, and open-collared tunics paired with flowing trousers. Swimwear boasted generous looping ties or thick, layered Maasai-inspired collars. Fitted, striped polo shirtsthe type of thing Missoni fans have long scoured vintage stores forfelt like a slam dunk. Before we were a zigzag, we were a stripe, said Missoni backstage, and for a house with an innately bohemian attitude (and during a season full of splashy, occasionally bewildering debuts), you cant get more straightforwardor more comfortingthan that.$$Miuccia Prada is interested in the political and the pervy. Always has beenbut especially now. Todays Miu Miu show had kitschy nylon-looking negligees layered over sweaters and gingham shirts; it involved wintry purple and green lozenge-patterned narrow coats and midi pencil skirts, fur stoles and boxy Deco-patterned cardigans. Anxious that this doesnt make sense? Dont be. That is exactly Pradas point. Though the outrageous glam rockmeets-Kiss multicolored patchwork platform boots are her other point, obviously: They might as well have had Buy Me Now picked out in the glitter on their heels. It all came out in an end-of-season conversation in the dark at the conclusion of the Miu Miu presentationthe show at which the audience is always stir-crazy after looking at clothes for 28 days in four cities and not exactly feeling entirely compos mentis. Neither is Prada, who talked about how she had to put together both the  mainline Prada collection and Miu Miu in the midst of dealing with the passing of her 103-year-old aunt, Nana, whom she described as a second mother. The designer wasnt at the Prada show, so this was the first time she surfaced in public this season. Really, Miu Miu was about irrationality, she began. The times we are in are extreme. Theres conservatism on both the right and left in politics. And then, people look for escapes from it, attracted to strange religious beliefs or underground clubs and music. One of the underground clubs shes thinking of is definitely kinkya sexy salon, she quipped, laughing as she indicated those see-through negligees, which were caught up in quite a few looks. As so often was the case this season, the assemblages on this runway seemed made to be pulled apart, layer by layer, and absorbed into a womans wardrobe in whatever manner makes sense to her. The ways of high-fashion styling are indeed extreme, but surely even the most ambitious blogger wont be daring enough to parade herself in the full Miu Miu rig in front of next seasons street photographers. Ladies suffering from dementia may be seen going out shopping thus attired, forgetting in which order the nightie goes on, but mimicking them in full may be a few steps too far down the road toward kooky delirium for most. On the other hand, there were the aforementioned boots, a major draw in a season of loudly decorative footwork, not to mention more conservatively sweet ballet slippers (again with a touch of the confused in their mismatched ribbon ankle ties), tiaras, ruffle-neck blouses,aSwan Laketutuand within it all, goth black-and-white silk pieces printed with candles and cigarette lighters, surely a mini collection unto itself. Theres a method to Miu Mius madness after all.$$Todays gritty MM6 Maison Margiela runway presentation was a flashback to the industrial techno dens of Londons subterranean club scene. In a cavernous corner east of the city, representatives of the MM6 collective wore anonymous white lab coats. The disruptive mood was cemented by the huge bank of analog recording equipmenta wall of sound, if you willthat formed the backdrop to this retro-futuristic warehouse party. As models took to the stage, they stopped to tinker with the equipment as if to create their own soundtrack to what was a hypnotic display. These club kids came well prepared for a long nightpacking Coke cans, beers, and even plastic banana holders in their Perspex cross-body bags (how else to stylishly sustain an all-nighter?). MM6 mainlined the chaos and creativity of post-gender club kids beautifully. This was an idea-packed show with more than one standout moment: There were eagle and equestrian prints, glitter-bombed fanny packs retooled as tops, and plastic bin liners fashioned into everything from a surprisingly elegant blouson to detachable pouf sleeves and a cerulean sundress. Ideas were pulled from not-so-distant eras, then reappropriated and repeated. There was also a prettiness here (for both boys and girls) in the pink metallic Ziggy Stardust two-pieces, and sheer dresses in khaki and pale blue that tied at the neck with pussy bows. MM6, surely, is a place for its group of designers to have fun mining the dress-up box of recent history. But the models, with determinedly blank stares and hunched posture, resembled androids, giving fun a far-off feel.$$When you are grown-up, its easy to long for the carefree, entirely fictional days of youth, and forget the reality of dreary schoolbooks and even drearier summer jobs. Is it any wonder that as you take your first steps into the adult world, you so often arm yourself with powerful fashion fantasies?  Molly Goddard, in her latest presentation, had her real girl models working at a replica of a sandwich factory, but they were going about their soul-numbing tasks in clouds of tulle and smocked raw silk ivory frocks. Is the designer telling us that this is the way life should be, that we must assert our fierce conviction that inside we are all fairy princesses! All ballerinas!regardless of what life holds for us at the moment? Certainly, this young designer is striking a chordduring recent Fashion Weeks in London and New York, numerous fashion editors (including this author) could be seen squeezing into tiny show seats swathed in billowing Goddard tulle. In this latest outing, Goddard offered her classic outsize silhouette with a few new embellishmentsa lovely acid green tutu featured hand embroideries; tiny pink skirts were awash in burgundy ruffles; and there were tartan dresses that seemed like the fantasy version of a school uniform that some little girl, who cant wait to grow up, is dreaming of.$$The program notes described this latest Moncler Gamme Rouge collection as Versailles meets Abstraction, which doesnt immediately call to mind luxe sportswear but does suggest something rather rarefied. And perhaps this has been the modus operandi of the Gamme Rouge range all alongyet it was never more apparent than today, when a mass of maidens ambled up and down a garden path (more enchantingly English than formal French) in looks that married haute couture with high performance. After a tender exchange with Lee Radziwill, creative director Giambattista Valli explained how a plumped-up slicker in technical lace, flounced dresses in embroidered PVC, a gray sweatsuit embellished with lilies of the valley, and a leotard in red jacquard all expressed varying degrees of the same elite inspirations: fencing and French chteaus. Indeed, when the bar is set this elegant, a parka is no longer a parkaits a rococo confection in guipure that happens to be rain resistant. Moncler gives me the technical fabrications and the support, and I do it in an atelier way, Valli noted as Bianca Brandolini dAdda planted a kiss on his cheek. The designer conceded that the Spring offering always poses a greater point-of-view challenge than Fall because outerwear isnt the customers priority. With this one, he plucked more elements from historical dress than usual; yet the floral-embroidered sneakers (and sneaker boots) kept the feeling decidedly fresh. Though there were quite a few dashing black looks for evening in the mix, such a predominantly white collection might send another message to his gilded lilies. Said Valli, I love the idea that Gamme Rouge is sporty but you can get married in it.$$Monique Lhuilliers front row was an apt description of where her brand is headed these days. Bella Thorne, Ashley Madekwe, and nearly a dozen other pretty young things were decked out in the velvet floral dresses and tea-length party frocks that defined the designers latest Fall and Resort collections. Considering that youth was one of the themes Lhuillier name-checked at a preview last week, those are just the girls who will want to wear Springs super-bold looks on the red carpet. Lhuillier has certainly never been afraid of color, but in this collection she turned the vibrancy up to the max. Bright poppy, lipstick pink, electric blue, and tangerine silk gazar made for sweet, sculptural shift dresses as well as more directional looks, like an emerald tunic over skinny jacquard flares or a turquoise bustier top with a trailing sash. Either of those pant-centric ensembles would be an unexpected choice for, say, a New York movie premiere or press call. Structure was a big message, but a parade of feather-light gowns in paint-splatter prints (and minimal embellishment) lent a more ethereal, artsier tone. The accessories were also hard to miss; its still a new category for Lhuillier, and here she made the case for matching your shoes to your outfit with jewel-like Lucite wedges and embellished sandals. It felt as though she designed them specifically with the red carpet in mind.$$Aspiring young designers have two new role models to look up to: Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, who presented their first collection for Monse on Saturday afternoon. The duo met during stints at Oscar de la Renta, where they discovered their own strengthsKim as design studio director, Garcia as a top designerwhile learning from a beloved industry legend.  For their buzzy debut, which saw Prabal Gurung, Domenico De Sole, and Ruth Wilson sitting front row, Kim and Garcia presented an original yet approachable vision. We like the idea of relaxed glamour, Garcia said before the show. A classic shirt was the starting point for everything. We realized its something that a lot of people can relate towe just looked at it in a different way. The first dress out was a cotton poplin mini that mimicked an oversize shirt wrapped artfully around the shoulders. It checked all the right boxes: There was texture, a fresh silhouette, and just a hint of charmall in one youthful and wearable garment. It was followed by a billowing maxi dress with a similar wrapped-and-knotted effect. Of course, the construction likely wasnt as easy as tying a bowbreaking down an item as familiar as the button-down shirt wouldnt work unless the craftsmanship was meticulous and a bit restrained. Those white cotton pieces were naturally relaxed, but even the grander propositions in silk faille, taffeta, and duchesse satin felt effortless. We wanted it to look like you just buttoned it up and were done, Kim said. Were inspired by real girls today who wear jeans, flats . . . They want something easy.  Its a concept that mirrored de la Rentas own passion for ready-to-wearclothes that make women feel beautiful, without being complicated. You could sense his influence in the rich jewel tones and luxe fabrics, too, and in the 3-D cotton flowers and oversize bows. Prepare to hear a lot more from Monse in the coming months.$$Nobody, but nobody is having more fun than Jeremy Scott at Moschino. Season by season, the ideas get zanier, but the productions just keep getting bigger. And why not, when his clothes and accessories are selling so well? True to silly form, tonights theme was car-wash couture. Traffic cones, barricades, and a genuine car wash that sprayed bubbles instead of water were installed on the runway. No Parking, Couture Zone, one sign read; another: Dangerous Couture Ahead. Also true to form, this was not a show about subtext. But if it was all out there on the waxed and polished surface, that doesnt mean it wasnt smart. Take the full-skirted trench coat with a warning sign on the backOpen Trench, it reador the little black dress with the iconic red octagon on the chest printed Shop, not Stop. In a he-thinks-of-everything moment, Scott had none other than Lapo Elkann, international playboy and heir to the Fiat automobile fortune, in the front row.  The accessories served up one visual pun after another. None other than Stephen Jones, milliner to fashion royals and royal royals, did the veiled hard hats and traffic cone chapeaux. There were toolbox and lunch-box bags, tail-fin sunglasses, and caution-tape sandals. As for the clothes, they were the tony uptown answer to last seasons below-14th-Street streetwear. Chanel-style skirt suits came in flashy neons with flashier reflective-tape edging; others had Cristbal Balenciagaworthy volumes. Scott played fast and loose with Chanel-isms, most literally and perhaps dangerously with a print of interlocking C clamps. A pair of petticoated satin party dresses with taillights lifted off a 57 Chevy looked like a subtler (if you can call it that) reference to Thierry Muglers iconic corset.  An extended evening section that riffed on the rotating brushes of drive-through car washes was capped off by a long column dress with a neon sign slung over one shoulder. Scotts got fans just crazy enough to take it for a spin IRL.$$There was a quiet confidence this morning at Mother of Pearl. Maybe the self-assured mood was helped along by the historic surroundings of the Caf Royal, but for her sophomore solo show, creative director Amy Powney embraced her pretty pioneer theme with gusto. It all started with Victoriana then took a Midwestern turn, she said backstage. But the real cues came from Laura Wilsons photographs of the Hutterites of Montana, a closed community whove farmed the land of the American West since the turn of the century. These settlers may eschew the technological trappings of modern life, but they sure know their way around a smock dress. And as Bon Ivers Holocene was plucked out on the banjo (what else?), Powney evoked those prairie pastures with a series of piecrust collar shirts, pinafore dresses, and pantsuitssome in decorative sequined ginghams and checks, and others in botanical prints of her own design. It was these trippy patternswhich up close revealed scenes of lobsters carrying combs and narcissistic birds gazing into Alice looking glassesthat were arguably the high point of the collection. In line with MOP founder Maia Normans signature sporty vision, all this was punctuated by some cleaner, sleeker looks. The black bonded leather and neoprene coats worn over scholarly mustard-toned tops and track-y pants were supremely wearable. But Powney never strayed too far from the frills and the flourisheseven athletic sweatshirts were embellished with ruffles and embroidered roses. Add playful footwear to this mixsneaker-soled Mary Janes that were carried through from Resort and pointy-toed 80s bootiesand youve got a collection that is seriously rich in box set inspiration. Pull out those copies of Little House on the Prairie and St. Elmos Fire now.$$Massimo Giorgetti quickly found an audience for his upbeat contemporary brand MSGM, launched four years ago. Street style types scooped it upits bright colors and loud prints are irresistible to photographersand now the label is found in hundreds of stores across the globe. His success landed him the plum assignment of creative director at Emilio Pucci. At home at MSGM today, he tried something new, swapping much of the quirky sweetness of previous seasons for a more tomboyish, wannabe badass spirit. His notes mentioned Catherine Hardwickes skateboard movie Lords of Dogtown, but he couldve just as easily been channeling another subculture turned mass culture, like grunge or punk, thanks to the shredded plaid separates, an oversize hoodie, and long knit pants that pooled at the soles of high-top sneaks. But Giorgetti didnt fully commit, and heavy silver chains wrestled with bows as the shows dominant decorative motif. They first dripped from long tunics and laced up the would-be seams of chain-mail tees and skirts. (MSGMs full-body collars could make 50 Shades of Greys Anastasia Steele blush.) Bows, meanwhile, adorned waistlines and hips, trailing ribbons past the knees. Ruffles were supersized, too. Up until now, the magic at MSGM has been in the mix, but this season Giorgetti's usual irreverence came off more like indecision.$$The ships propeller backdrop and aircraft carrier runway semaphored David Komas theme at Mugler today: military. What, again? The frequency with which the uniform of war is press-ganged by designers intent on crafting clothes to love can seem counterintuitive in an industry based on generating innovation. Donatella Versace just launched her martial-themed Spring 16 collectiona campaign for gender empowermentwhile Chalayans was a typically dense take inspired by the end of Cubas isolation. Every season, for either gender, you can expect a significant military presence. Why? Its not complicated. When done well, military collections can make the utilitarian seem sexy via universally recognizable signifiers. Komas casus belli seemed straightforward, too: Half-hiding behind a mirror to evade well-wishers after this show, the designer said, We have such incredible girls here, and its about being inspired by them. Wanting them to look cool, to look fresh, and to enjoy clothes. He rattled through pretty much every military service. The first wave was naval, an interplay of navy and white with decorative insignia buttons on looks that included an angled peak-lapel, three-button, double-breasted jacket and minidresses that rearranged the fold and contrast of traditional sailor suits. One dress featured a lovely helter-skelter twist of white that twined around the body above a four-button accent. Softer items included an asymmetrical-hemmed pliss dress with half-zip details at the waist. Next into the field came the army; the olive section included a cutaway backless dress in leatherthe top and bottom half linked by a clasp of three gleaming officer stripes. Soft kicky trousers were topped with deconstructed bodices, while the classic field jacket was turned into a sleeveless minidress with silk poacher pocketsa skinny belt peppered with eyelets cinched the waist. A dress decorated with a grid of angular metal openings and dresses crisscrossed with metal-piped slashes were harder to link to Komas theme, although the former did demand the wearer go commando: She must NOT wear underwear, ordered the look-board backstage. Komas body-con brigade kept coming; some in hefty-heeled, pointy-toed, monk-strap flats, some with the straps of their handbags looped through the epaulets at their shoulder. A burst of burnt orange looks ran contrary to the camouflage agenda of real militarywear but had the explosive impact that Muglers customers enjoy. The final push was Doutzen Kroes, looking invincible in a backless navy jumpsuit. This was a deceptively simple but cleverly executed take on military, and it won.$$The seed for Naeem Khans Spring 2016 collection was first sowed in Mexico, where the designer hosted his wifes 60th birthday party. The theme of the three-day event was centered around Frida Kahlo, and guests were encouraged to come dressed the part, flower headdresses and all. That idea carried him on a trip to the Mediterranean, where his fascination with flowers bloomed. Dresses in bougainvillea pink, lilac, and marigold floated down the runway, and some of the most successful looks referenced that influence, including a gorgeous lemon floral-beaded caftan gown. Khan was also thinking of muses like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren; echoes of styles worn by both could be seen in the wasp-waist, full-skirted ball gowns. A lilac gazar number with rolled bateau neckline particularly recalled Kellywell surely be seeing that one on the red carpet soon. Princess gowns have their place, as Kelly more than proved in her lifetime, but Khan would do well to curb his appetite for embellishment here. A dress with a bustier emblazoned with a large glittering heart, for instance, verged into Disney heroine territory.  That embellishment worked best when its design wasnt so overt. Backstage, Khan said that 600 people worked on the collection; up close, each gown was clearly a masterpiece, so it was disappointing when the message became slightly muddled on the runway. The sky-high platform heels seemed another misstep, particularly as models struggled not to trip over the delicate skirts. Khan has already proven his skill at creating gorgeous, red carpetworthy gowns; the designer doesnt need to dress it up so much. In fact, as happened with a few looks, the extra fixings detracted from the main course.$$Nanette Lepore always manages to inject a swipe of playfulness into her clothes. Take this season, when the designer introduced her collection at her downtown store, transforming the presentation space into a full-on bash. Ive always threatened to have a big party! said Lepore. And then I made fun clothes that people would want to go out in. The attire matched the carefree scene, ranging from cocktail pieces to daywear, all with references that hovered between the late 60s and 70s (Time periods when everything was happening, said Lepore). That feel-good, let-loose attitude was evoked in an off-the-shoulder black eyelet dress, while a floral-print frock in groovy neon blues and purples had a bohemian swing to it. Cool retro separates came in a multi-patterned jacket with ruffled kimono sleeves and a polished pair of cropped flares.  One infusion, however, brought the party into the here and now: that was the segment of the show devoted to select pieces from Lepores collaboration with Eddie Eddie by Billy Tommy, a line of shirts featuring cheeky statements and graphics, worn by Miley Cyrus and Kendrick Lamar. Lepore translated the statement-making text nicely into body-skimming silhouettes, like a Pepto-pink slip dress that was emblazoned with Slippery When Wet and a bubblegum-lacquered midi skirt with a thigh-high slit that had This Is My Favorite Mini Skirt Duh! printed on it. But it was the Tie Me Up Please Thank You tube top, cleverly paired with empire-waist pin-striped gaucho pants, thats guaranteed to keep both Lepores grown-up and teenage customers equally entertained at any party.$$Narciso Rodriguez is an engineer as much as he is a designer. Hes always had a thing for seams, and his clothes are constructed like precision instruments. After a Fall collection with elongated silhouettes perched on towering heels that took his preoccupations to extremes, Rodriguez was after something more sensual here. Its a bit undone, he said beforehand. Outfit number one was a black sateen top as glossy as leather that wrapped asymmetrically around the waist above a pair of full white trousers. Not undone by a long shot, but it was definitely more relaxed than what hes been up to the last couple of seasons. It was followed up with an extremely fitted side-buttoning jacket: As a rule, though, the clothes here floated on the body. Silk tees slouched off one shoulder, and dresses twisted around the legs to fall in asymmetrical hems.  The gentler silhouette was a welcome development. So too was Rodriguezs use of fabrics with a keen sense of the hand: the sateen that looked like leather and the nubby linen he chose for dresses that arched over one knee, which, by the way, happened to be completely reversible to silk chiffon. Tech fabrics tend to have a flatness that leaves you cold. There wasnt a chance of that here. Rodriguez explained that his starting point was photographs of the ocean floor, but the palette was warm: bright amber, lacquer red, and golden mineral rings that swooped across dresses and encircled others from front to back. The sea creature embroidery on a bias-cut white silk dress was as exquisite as anything well see all season.$$Many designers are rethinking the way they show their wares to press and buyers this season, and Neil Barrett is among them. In lieu of a jam-packed presentation, the Milan-based Brit hung banners and plastered the floor of his Paris showroom with a camo-meets-kaffiyeh-scarf print, inviting editors one by one to view his entirely colorless Spring collection. Monochromatic, after all, is a tried-and-true signature for the designer (whose womens lineup remains unapologetically rooted in his menswear background) and the East-meets-West military pattern rings true with his rigorous creations that collide historical references through a linear lens. This time around, Barrett shook up that rigor by way of bold fringing and pleat details on slinky separates and accessories that loosened up his sleeveless tailoring and jacquard outerwear with a sporty lan. Fringes can be fussy, but here, sliced bands of black leather and its vegan alternative (a savvy compromise for washable T-shirt dresses) read punchy and sleek as wide belts and slashed skirt layers, both paired with fanning peplum shirts, graphic minis, or a generous fluid pant. Layered in alternating scales, Barretts somewhat militant graphics were softened through their tactile application: Wide cotton weaves and a rich silk jacquard ensured zipped blousons, and bomber jackets held a dressed-down eveningwear potential. Those looks provoked the same twist of tomboy ease he worked into a sleeveless tux jacket thrown over collaged artist tees: The series of three features Picasso, Hockney, and Basquiats faces peeking out from under a kaffiyeh. Its an irreverent remix, and a diabolical sign of the times.$$Nellie Partow specializes in two very different categories: tailoring and knitwear. Neither lends itself particularly well to the concept of lightness, but thats where Partow got to work on her Spring 16 collection. Earlier this summer, I was just standing in my closet and thinking about how difficult it is to find pieces that are really light and easy, she explained. You see a lot of silks and wools out there, but not really beautiful cotton. So she developed a superfine, 37-gauge cotton with an Italian mill, whipping it into semi-sheer sweaters that scarcely weighed more than tissue paper. Elsewhere, Partow used similarly buoyant materials such as stretch cotton jacquard, fluid crepe, and an airy, weblike cotton ingrained with silk fibers. In layering items like crisp shirts, wide-leg pants, and natty little blazers, those fabrics skimmed the body rather than clung to it.   Partow approached her popular hand-knits with a new sense of ease and structure. Coated cotton held its shape on a boxy cardigan, and different cabling techniques lent a bit of slouch to the designers signature rose gold cutout sweater. I love the idea of one of these knits being your jacket, she said. The contrast between her sharply cut pantswhich have inspired a following of their ownand a nubby, artisanal knit will appeal to women who think about texture and shape before print and embellishment. Partows color palette also mirrored her quiet approach to luxury: Refreshing shades of ice blue and orchid popped against cognac, olive green, and ivory.$$Springs fodder may be new territory for Nicholas K, but suffice it to say, its in the brands DNA. For their latest outing, dubbed Terminal Velocity, the sister-and-brother team of Nicholas and Christopher Kunz looked at flight suits; after all, their father was a flight surgeon, their brother a Navy SEAL. A tenor of utilitarianism was high from the word go, starting with a cream-colored parachute trench worn by show opener Sarah Abney. Like many of the other items, it came with a cross-body rope clasped with a tough-looking carabiner. The light, glossy nylon the designers used billowed like silk, and while it may have been an exploratory move, they ran with it, whipping yards of the fabric into maxi dresses, skirts, and ponchosso much as to blend together at times. With dip-dyed styles, otherworldly-looking silk dresses, and trousers in shades of charcoal and saffron, they had some real winners on their hands. Among the 50 looks, the pair might have done with a few more of the pieces akin to those and their capes in supple periwinkle denim, clothes that nodded to the presence of a human hand. All that nylon felt, in places, a little anonymous, coming up short on covetabilitythough their gorgeous drop-waist jumpsuit in distressed leather surely did not.$$Nicole Miller didnt have to look too far for inspiration this season. I kind of became obsessed with the grate pattern you see on loading gates, said the designer, who had cast her eye about and found a petri dish of inspiration in her urban surroundings. I took a lot of things very literally from the street, she said. No kidding: One of the recurring prints was of a brick wall plastered with graffiti, and the diamond grate motif popped up on denim and dresses, and also informed a few sexy cutouts. I wanted it to have the grit of New York, explained Miller. Gritty is not a word usually used to describe her brand, and its introduction here may not be appreciated by Millers core customers. However, theyll find plenty to love in the sheath dresses and sequin maxi gownswhether theyre fans of graffiti or not.  Some of the strongest pieces referenced other types of paintingless St. Marks Place street art and more Jackson Pollock. Indeed, a black and white splatter print that appeared on handbags and denim instantly recalled the artist. Other standouts included a white sheath dress embroidered with colorful scribbles, and a white organza shift with brick-like embroidery and flower paillette appliqus. This is where the collection hit its stride: when Miller got to what she does best (pretty, flattering dresses) and left most of the grit on the New York City sidewalks.$$Its a stylists world and the rest of us may well just be living in it. But for her Spring outing, Nili Lotan harked back to a time when raw young talents were creating not only music but the kind of images that are still setting the tenor for much of what the industry strives for todaybefore every on-the-rise starlet had her look carefully crafted by a team of pros. Pictures of Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, and Patti Smith lined Lotans mood board; the designer particularly connected with the earnestness of Vietnam War-era singer-songwriters like Baez and Mitchell, dubbing this collection Blue 1971 in an homage to the latter. Likewise, she called on her own 70s adolescence, when she was beginning to cement the personal style that defines her brand today. Springs free-spirited prcis fell right in step with the codes that have long kept Lotans followers coming back for more: slouchy army pants and jackets, gauzy bohemian tops, and floor-skimming dresses. Resorts bewitching eveningwear,  la YSL, gave way to a mix of casual and rakishly elegant pieces, every one of them a wardrobe workhorse. The smashing sailor pants looked natty against the gritty milieu of this seasons lookbook, bien sr, but would have plenty of Jane Birkin-esque appeal teamed with Lotans plunging blouses in sheer, fluttering chiffon (Serge Gainsbourg and his longtime lover made up the European contingent on the designers mood board). The latter drew a stark and lovely contrast to a grouping of military-tinged items, like a hardy, utilitarian-looking dress in olive drab with gorgeous lace-up detailing. Lotan may have streamlined the offering of her famously lush knits, but with the wealth of winning options here, fans are sure to find plenty to stock their wardrobes till fall.$$Guillaume Henry has the goodwill of the fashion community. He gave Carven, which was a defunct couture house when he arrived in 2009, a global profile and a distinctive look. Women responded to Carvens gamine sensibility, and the brand grew quickly, opening a store in New York. Tonights show was Henrys second for Nina Ricci, but he hasnt yet found his footing. Its an issue more of tone than execution, though both play a part. His backstage mood board was pinned with pictures of Romy Schneider in the 1971 film Max et les Ferrailleurs, and images of 90s models like Kate Moss, Nadja Auermann, and Kristen McMenamy. Id love men to fall in love with [the Nina Ricci woman], he said.  Thats not a bad goal, but this was provocation without seduction, a fact that came down to the stiffness of some of his materials, the sheerness of others, and a generally slack, away-from-the-body silhouette. The shows patent ostrich skin had a glossy, almost lurid sheen, but it was about as unyielding as materials get. The black-and-white cowhide coat and apron-dress werent much more forgiving. This will no doubt make us sound both American and prudish: Considering Nina Ricci is a brand historically known for its lingerie, it wouldve been nice to see a bra underneath Henrys sheer organza blousons. But his see-through wrap skirts were an even bigger miss. The best pieces here were the micro-pliss shifts which enhanced the models natural hourglass shapes. Henry should keep them in mind when he begins working on his next collection.$$Fashion may fall head over teakettle for decades in fullOh, the 70s, with their suede and their slouch! Give us a 40s tea dress! Or the 90s slip!but in real life, real women reach into their closets to be confronted with (if theyre lucky) a living record of any variety of eras.Alessandro DellAcqualeaned into this reality with his collection for Spring. Its inspired by Corinne Dayso 90sand the fabulous Tina Modotti, the designer said backstage before the show. Modotti, the actress and photographer, died nearlyhalf a century before Days iconic snaps of Kate Moss, which gives an idea of the temporal range DellAcqua was working with. Its about inverting images, overlapping and reworking, masculine and feminine, and quite sexy, said the designer. There were macram dresses in soft pastel shades, crepe pinafores, and cotton lace with chantilly overlay, all in various stages of tumbling off the body to illustrate DellAcquas pointthough this was less an overt va-va-voom take on sexy than a slightly quiet, Manic Pixie Dream Girl one. (The diamond tiaras tangled in some models hair aided in the latter notion.) Caban-style jackets boasted Latin-inspired ruffles and pom-pom trims; narrow overalls came in lace; wrap skirts made of strips of python leather and worn with striped boxy tops resembled nothing so much as a backgammon boardand oh, the rules of love! There were also, worn under nearly everything, white T-shirts, tank tops, and deconstructed button-downs, with ties left dangling to the wind.Crepede Chine blouses and jumpers boasted a delicate design that, upon further inspection, became a subtle in-joke: lit cigarettes trailing swirls of smoke. (Remember, 90s.) Berbere inspired sandals (pom-poms! feathers! sequins!) were equally anything-goes; and it was all resoundingly for the girl who doesnt dress for the decade shes in (or even the decade she wishes it to be) so much as wholly for herself.$$As the owner of New York Citys well-loved Centre Market Place boutique of the same name, Karin Bereson knows how her No. 6 customer shops. Her new lineup played savvily to that, with a first delivery that was all about cheery, 60s- and 70s-hued nostalgia for some much needed sunny vibes in the midst of winter, and a second delivery thats all about easy pieces to transition nicely into spring. Of course, ease is a key selling point of all of Beresons wares. Its a subtle evolution from season to season, with familiar shapes making comebacks in cheeky prints or jolie laide colors, but recent collections have found the designers gamine sensibilities imbued by a new feeling of femininity. That came to life most winningly in looks like a pieced-together slip dress in blush linen and silk, which would pair just as nicely with sneakers as it would stilettos. It had a kind of understated sexiness about it that felt like a particularly nice addition to the spectrum Bereson and her team regularly offer up. Still, if many of No. 6s shoppers are longtime clients who keep coming back for classic mainstays like jumpsuits or the labels terrific culottes and drop-crotch trousers, they surely wont bristle at Springs great new expansion efforts. First, and most notably, are four soign footwear styles, all made in Peru and all, as Bereson puts it, shoes that disappear. The eminently shoppable bag offering has expanded, too, building on Resorts leather bucket bag with a half-moon woven shape for the beach and a killer patchworked suede tote. No. 6 first dipped a toe into the waters of swim for Spring 15 and here turned out two bikinis and two maillots, plus a Don Draperpoolside terry-lined shirt and shortsone of the lineups coolest propositions.$$And now for something completely different. Kei Ninomiya is quietly and painstakingly riveting together a darkly wonderful body of work. This collection contained more of his inky-black intricately engineered dresses made by bolting scores of curled polyester organdy strips, rendered flowerlike in shape, held together with a skeleton of tiny studs. The dresses contain not a single stitch, and float around the wearer. Ninomiyas shapes were more adventurous this time than last, and featured jagged sculptural protrusions. He has also discovered that when he turns these pieces inside out there is a different texture to their beauty. These are amazing, but challenging to wear, signature pieces.  A touch less Lady Gaga but no less dense-with-effort was the dress containing a twist of 7,000 hand-applied beads that took two people three days to construct. That was the longest, said Ninomiya. A biker jacket of transparent vinyl worn over some pinstripe culottes was stitched together with a macram of plastic cord; another biker was decorated with jagged lines of more transparent plastic; and yet another biker, with a satin sheen, featured arms constructed of Ninomiyas signature studded organdy, whose segments undulated over each other and strongly resembled a ravens wings. I make things in a new way, said Ninomiya. And so he does, rather brilliantly.$$Nurses scrubs may not, at first thought, set most womens hearts aflutter. But inspirations such as that underscore Yara Flinns knack for marrying utilitarianism with lean, youthful elegance. Spring found the Nomia designer riffing on workwear of different sorts, from those aforementioned scrubs (nodded to in a sporty V neck) to fabrications in denim ticking, which Flinn stumbled on in researching uniforms at the Mets Costume Institute Reference Library. That ticking came to life beautifully as a kimono with raw denim trim.  Consistency is a key element of Flinns lineups from season to season; hallmarks like her patch pockets and D-ring details tie an evolving body of work neatly together. Chances are that her customers can make space in their wardrobes for another of her classic slit-back dusters, as well as a newer style for Nomia, the terrific, slinky one-sleeved dress.$$When in doubt, go with a classic. Today, the All In One Dress, a style Norma Kamali first introduced back in 1973, became the cornerstone of her Spring collection. After seeing a serious response from her distributors, the designer is taking a fresh look at the shape, sending it out in three lengths (maxi, mini, and medium) and a variety of prints. Wear it as-is, with its funnel neck and dolman sleeves, or pull an arm through the collar and wear it one-sleeved, with the other one tied around your waistper Kamali, the possibilities are damn near endless. Even if the DIY opportunities of that piece dont delight, its charm is mirrored in so many of Kamalis garments: Ball them up and toss in a carry-on, throw in the wash, and start all over again. That goes for shapes like her fishtail flare, which kicked out in a full circle from the knee, and some spruce activewear tailoring. While those are sure to please new converts to the Kamali lifestyle, for the customer who comes back season after season, the designer served up a generous offering of new prints, from a splashy painted floral to trompe l'oeil jean patchwork. Even better was the real deal: a series of fraying raw denim styles like a trench and kicky skirt, all reversible, and all very cool.$$Art has always played a big role in Jordana Warmflash's collections for Novis, but while references to Henri Matisse may have skewed too literal in the past, a more pared-back approach for Spring should catch buyers attention. She drew inspiration from Clarice Cliffs graphic, slightly rustic pottery for her vibrant color palette of mint, cerulean, and poppy, while hits of black and white ensured the clothes were, for the most part, still quite wearable. Sleeker silhouettes helped that cause, too. Column gowns, A-line skirts, and razor-sharp trousers acted like blank slabs of porcelain to be decorated with geometric prints, kitschy landscapes, and matte beading. Print and color are integral to the Novis message, but Warmflash should continue to explore texture, as well. The best pieces featured a soft color-blocked crochet, which captured the theme, but also had a warm, artisanal feeling that will appeal to a wide range of customers.$$Our newness right now is not really newness, and to us, thats the newness. Thats Oaks Louis Terline on the tack the well-loved New Yorkbased brand is taking. He makes a valid point: The breakneck pace of not just fashion, but the world, can hardly be sustainable. And so Terline and cofounder Jeff Madalena have zeroed in on their obsessions, the things that keep an expansive demographic coming back to their stores and website; pieces like killer leather jackets, knits, and trousersall at varying levels of inkiness. The other newness? Taking cues from the hip employees of Oaks four shops: pullovers worn inside out, for example, or almost comically oversize. Those styling tweaks yielded coolly subtle reinventions of staple pieces: dropping a sweatshirt shoulder by two inches, or adding, say, 15 to a baseball jacket. Where youth culture in fashion is typically something that has trickled so far down as to be totally divorced from whence it came, something feels authentic in Terline and Madalenas buy-now-wear-now riffs on what their employees are doing. Beyond that, their clothes are just plain cool, and wearable to boot. As Terline tells it, theyre always designing back to the jeans. For Spring, Oaks denim will team with workwear-inspired quilting, and sporty touches like a zip-front funnel-neck topall in the brands signature monochromatic palette. For the record, all that black is as much function as it is fashion, chalked up by the designers to tiny New York City apartments with finite storage, and the citys general grime. But lest things get too geocentric, Terline and Madalena havent forgotten their more far-flung followers: This season for L.A. fans the designers are introducing a lightweight take on their classic motorcycle jacketjust new enough.$$When will girls stop pining after vintage jeans? The high-rise, straight-leg style (whether actually vintage or just vintage-inspired) has become more than a trendits totally changed the way we dress. Alexandra Michelle was doing non-stretch boy jeans at Objects Without Meaning before everyone else started cutting up their Levis, and she quickly earned a cult following for them. But the key to Michelles success is that she also answers the question of what to wear with her jeans, offering a steady range of luxurious, collectible basics like silk camisoles, ribbed-knit turtlenecks, and linen T-shirts. Her approach is as no-frills as it gets; minimal silhouettes are elevated with comfy, high-quality fabrics, and there are zero prints or embellishments, save for an unraveling hem here or a twisted strap there. It gives her customers room to layer, style, and accessorize as they please. For Spring, Michelle expanded both her denim and basics categories. First, she got a bit more experimental with her indigo: Some jeans had blurred squares of darker blue, mimicking a patchwork effect, while an A-line, button-front skirt had a released hem. She styled it over ribbed lounge pants; elsewhere, some of Michelles best-selling powder-blue flares peeked out from under a tea-length poplin dress. Those new layering ideas felt freshest hereshe also put her own spin on head-to-toe knit dressing and introduced her first swimsuits, which were spare enough to be worn under cardigans and denim shorts.$$For someone who has orchestrated theatrically imposing and occasionally improvised stage environments for Kanye West, a dfil of 20 looks within a compact, contemporary art gallery would seem like no big deal. But as this was Virgil Ablohs first runway show for his label, Off-Whiteas well as his 35th birthdaythe occasion felt, well, special. Abloh titled his collection Off-Day, although not out of some reverse-karmic pre-emptive strike. As he explained, the latest Off-White undertaking emerged from several streams of thought, but principally how cool girls today have figured out that the most relevant dress code has nothing to do with dressing up. Abloh (who earned a masters in architecture) used a white tee and blue jeans as his building blocks, which he subsequently broke down to arrive at a draped crepe tuxedo top, an open-sided gilet, tiered maxi sack skirt, and flocked grid-pattered pajamas, among other transformations. Some combination of cropping, lengthening, offsetting, patchworking, bias cutting, and hand-pleating went into each look. And thats not even accounting for the time Abloh spent at the Levi Strauss & Co. archives (six pairs of jeans were reworked from the companys denim), or going through the necessary legal channels to redesign an old Grateful Dead crew shirt (via illustrator Othelo Gervacio). All told, a lot of effort. And yet, for Abloh, this wasnt enough. I want to push the concept of showing in front of an audience in Paris, he declared backstage. I want it to be a reminder that this is still an art formnot just the clothing but making people gather in a room and creating a moment that opens their minds. Hence the clear plastic coats donned by a handful of models as they took their final walkAbloh plans to produce these for his Off-White staff in the spirit of MargielameetsSteve Jobs: that is, A corporate culture statement coming from someone whos so chill. In the spirit of performance art, a local graffiti artist closed the show by defacing the coats with a dramatic flourish. Guests may have been too ensconced in the rapid-fire tagging to notice a line of lettering placed high on one of the clerestory walls. Positioned upside down, it spelled out Why are you looking at, which Abloh attributed to the ongoing refrain among those who binge on fashion shows so heavily that nothing ultimately registers. So was this show any different? To the extent that it came across as a multilayered exercise in self-expression, yes. But often a single lookthose jeans spliced with organza windowpanes, for exampleis all it takes.$$Really, there are any number of ways to do summer style. For some, theres the desire for the easy, the breezy, and the often sheer; for others, theres a chain-fringed bandeau and trouser boasting a Justin Bieberesque quasi-harem drape. For either (for both!), there is Ohne Titels Spring 2016 collection. As usual, there were the technically advanced knits the house is known for, seen in body-conscious one-shouldered tops and skirts, bodysuits, bikinis, and a red and white fit-and-flare frock that sunny Sunday dreams are made of. Nearly all the knits had geometrical patterns painstakingly woven in. New for Ohne Titel were the entirely fetching gauzy pleated caftan dresses, lightweight pieces in bright, summery shades, and a series of fringed bra tops, skirts, and a dress crafted from the chains of ball bearings. Off-the-shoulder viscose rompers and separates came in shades of crimson and magenta that felt fresh and easy, and easily imagined on any number of vacationing It girls, from Montauk to Ibiza. But it was a geometrically printed silk shirtdress, long, lean, and slashed at the shoulders, in a deep teal and navy combination, that felt like the biggest advance made in the pursuit of true summer style.$$Olympia Le-Tan doesnt merely infuse her collections with her own personalityshe injects them with her life-experiences too. This was an autobiographically touched collage of homage to her relationship with Japan, one that Le-Tan first determined to make after hearing of the demolition of her favorite Tokyo hotel, the Okura. So, Hotel Olympia ran the cursive script on the front of her reverse souvenir jacket with a coiled rope logo to reflect her interestan aesthetic one, she emphasizedin kinbaku (Japanese bondage).  Binding twisted at the ankle of her hyper-stylized Louboutin geta, chokered the neck of some looks, fronted Stephen Joness black mesh face masks and formed the wristlets of her signature minaudires. These featured Hello Kitty, My Melody, and Little Twin Starscuteness oclockas well as what looked like illustrations of Hokusai-as-Polaroids. The hexagon knits were hat tips to the carpet at Le-Tans lamented hotel and the red teapots a nod to Yasujir Ozus favored recurring cinematic motif. The Polaroid prints were illustrations by Le-Tans father, Pierre, of pictures taken by the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, including some of the designer. Eclectic and authentic, this collection was particularvery particularto Le-Tan herself: That should make it ultra-appealing to her followers. Fetishists and Hello Kitty obsessives will no doubt be stimulated too.$$A fashion industry vet I know once joked that, given the reiteration of certain themes among designers, hed like the opportunity to assign fresh concepts to brands. Farm-to-table was one of the concepts he proposed. Opening Ceremony honchos Carol Lim and Humberto Leon never lack for inventive references, and this season, they came up with one pretty similar to farm-to-table all on their own. Their set, in a cavernous space on Wall Street, was a marvel to beholdabout a zillion potted plants, which will be replanted, after the show, at four schools around the city as part of the Edible Schoolyard NYC program. That worthy initiative was one expression of the new Opening Ceremony collections larger theme: Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright, Lim and Leon explained, had a daughter who was a modern dancer, and he often designed sets for her shows. And as an architect, he was concerned with the idea of a home as a set for livingthe place where people perform the daily rituals that, taken together, add up to a life. He was also a fan of intentional communities, self-sustaining mini utopias organized on much the same logic as that of indigenous tribes. These were all interesting paths to explore, via fashion, but the problem with this evenings OC outing was that Lim and Leon chose to explore all of them at once. The intentional community ideathat would have been a lively and timely organizing principle for a collection, but the designers diverted it into the set. The dance element came through in the inclusion of dancers, who performed seemingly spontaneous choreography, among the shows models. Mainly, the clothes dilated on the theme of home and the decorative elements that make one up. Lim and Leon are particularly eclectic in their tastes, so their riff on this reflected that sensibility, with mixed results. This was a difficult collection to wrap your head around. Wright-era design elements were one motif, imparted, for instance, in the prevalence of sand tones in the palette, and knit dresses and skirts with a weave like that of mid-century chairs. Architecture, in general, got a look, notably in the jumpsuits and tunics that featured inverted arch-shaped necklines. These were the collections most direct looks, and among its very best. The laid-back mood of at-home lounging was referenced in silk garments with a certain pajama mien; those that featured chinoiserie embroidery boasted surprising streetwise appeal. There were other pieces, as well, that lent a global magpie aesthetic to the proceedings. It was easy to isolate standout individual itemsthis collection was especially strong in its trouser silhouettes and its knitsbut the showing as a whole never really cohered. It left you wondering what the uniform of a Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned utopia might have been. That farm-to-table conceptits still up for grabs.$$I knew this dame was trouble as soon as she walked into my office . . . . The femme fatale is a recurring trope in fashion, but its safe to say that none have looked quite like the muse of John Patricks film noirinfluenced new collection. Patrick was mostly taking his cues from the high-contrast lighting used in classics of the genre, but he also had the wit to propose that trouble, of the dame variety, neednt come in a slinky, red-lipped package. Trouble can also be fresh-faced and clad in boyish cropped trousers and a matching jacket, or a virginal shift of crisp cotton poplin, or a preppy cardigan and high-waist mini. Even the cleanest-cut girl has, at some point in her life, longed to make (or be) trouble. Not that Patrick avoided slinkiness entirely. In fact, this was a sexier outing than usual for him: Alongside the slouchy all-Americana staples much of a piece with previous Organic collections, there were body-hugging slip dresses in a squishy, mesh-like knit, and flirty looks in neon tulle and lace. An ankle-length T-shirt dress in that neon tulle went so far as to conjure the lurid atmosphere of the Vegas Strip. Apparently the Organic girl has a dark side, too.$$Its been 20 years since Orla Kielys signature leafy prints showed themselves to the world. The Irish designer marked the moment in swinging style today with a presentation of adorable clothes and accessories that revealed her secret passion: crazy golf, the sport also known as mini golf or Putt-Putt. I dont play actual golf, Kiely admitted, gesturing to the sprawling stage set that provided the backdrop for her Spring collection. But I love crazy golf. Its just so fun! And as the sun shone through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the models wasted no time in pulling up their cute, floral-patterned caddies and taking a putt. Kiely pulled her muted palette of coral, lime, and lilac from the poolside photographs of Slim Aarons, and the clothes conjured an uncomplicated trip to Palm Springs, California. I always love the 60s and 70s, said Kiely. And its Palm Springs that really sets the tone for that era. The silhouettes swung from pinafores and shift dresses to loose, flowing jumpsuits, all tethered to that mid-century feel. The standout moment came in the form of a chartreuse shorts suit in heavy jacquard, which made for wholly appropriate sundowner attire. Though the swans and windmills and oversize poodle (perhaps inspired by house stylist Leith Clarks much-loved pet pooch) were all well played, it was Kiely who really hit a hole in one.$$Whats new in a glutted knitwear market? The trio behind Orley, husband-and-wife team Matthew and Samantha Orley, and Matts brother Alex, are hard at work figuring out just that. Yarns are the bread-and-butter for the brand, and so, for its third womens offering (the first season, Fall 15, was picked up by Barneys), the designers wisely opted to emphasize their foundation in knitwear before branching out into wovens. Of an all-knit lineup, the team estimated 70 percent to be Italian-loomed, the rest handmade in New York, and stressed their desire to create a narrative, not just a really nice cashmere sweater. That end game was clear from the word go, with every piece of the Spring lineup speaking to a certain off-kilter, almost Tenenbaum-esque take on preppiness, from polo shirts to sweater vests (yep, sweater vests). Take a cotton-cashmere pleated skirt in a mod-looking custom graphic print. It had a splash of retro quirk to it without feeling overly precious. A pair of mulberry and tussah silk flares, though, sat firmly on this side of the 21st century and echoed the industrys current yen for head-to-toe sweater dressingso polished you could take them to the office, but so forgivingly stretchy you might just opt to wear them for SVU reruns at home, too. Things heated up in a cable-knit pullover with a surprisingly sexy back and open panels, the result of crocheting around laser-cut plastic discs.  At a recent studio preview, Alex emphasized the importance of not just reworking their mens styles for womensix months from now the trio expect their girls business to outstrip their guys. Here was a lineup that was strong, but also single-minded enough that youd look forward to seeing how the label will diversify next season. One of the collections standouts, a crocheted shift in cherry-red and white stripes, offered a promising hint.$$Possibly, it seems ridiculous to begin a fashion show review with a discussion about the precisely desirable color of a carnation. Yet it is a fact that there is a vast gulf of taste between a deli-cum-gas-station pink or white type of a carnation, and the deep, deep, almost cinnamon-dark kind of a red carnation, which Oscar de la Renta picked for his daily buttonhole when he was a young man living in Madrid. But the fact that Peter Copping, Oscars successor, picked up on that color, and its resonances, is a perfect testament to his suitability for the job. He, like Oscar, has a phenomenal eye for color and social tone. Apparently, said Copping before the show, they used to throw red carnations into the ring after a bull fight. Which explains the presence of carnation prints in various sizes that Copping scattered on dresses, swathed skirts, and frilled blouses, and the fact that he saturated an eyelet dress in the color of Oscars favorite flower. Copping was partially inspired by his discovery that De la Renta had met Ava Gardner, whose lover was a bullfighter, in the 1950s. But to research the Spring collection, he had also been up to the Hispanic Society of Harlem to look at their paintings surrounding bullfightinghe took in everything from the pale blue satin of a matador suit painted by Goya, to the exact shade of baked yellow Francis Bacon used in a bullfighting scene, to the colors of peasant wool embroidery on popular Spanish postcards, said Copping. Then he let it all percolate in his imagination, and came up with a collection that thoroughly proved his own powers as a colorist, and as a designer who brings the finesse of Paris with him from all the years he worked at Louis Vuitton and Nina Ricci. The combination of respectfulness for the founder and pure personal flair made for a collection that succeeded in making every woman present at the show want to be part of Coppings ravishing modern view of femininity and sexuality. The sight of his models, scrubbed and groomed with matte red lipstick, their hair brushed smoothly into ponytails with low grosgrain ribbon bows, made fashions prevailing messy no-makeup grungy beauty suddenly look a whole lot less desirable at a stroke. It was not just a question of the breathtaking color choices, which ran from saturated to pastelsay, emerald green duchesse satin for a skirt suit with a narrow powder pink belt, or the grass green embroidered shoes under a mint gazar dressbut also of Coppings ability to undercut froth and frills with a modernizing casualness. He did that by putting suits with jet-embroidered flat espadrilles, by tying black ribbons nonchalantly into incredible lilac and ice-blue ball gowns, and by daring to show glimpses of naked skin through black lace. In a word, it was faultless.$$Plenty of designers have found inspiration in the Amazon jungle, but very few have actually visited the place, let alone camped there and participated in tribal rituals. But then Oskar Metsavahta UNESCO Goodwill ambassador and former doctoris not like most designers.  One year ago, I went to the Amazon forest and met the Ashninka tribe and was invited to their rituals, said Metsavaht. The whole collection is inspired by that experience. The narrative begins with the monochromatic blue looks in contrasting silk and suede, inspired by the ocean, and a photo-printed silk dress that referenced the designer's overhead view of the jungle as he flew in. As Metsavahts stay with the Ashninka continued, he began to incorporate the tribes element of stylethe materials and colors. Linen pieces in white or earthy taupe, some of which were tied in organic knots at the hip or waist, had an attractive rough-hewn quality. The lone red look, constructed from a latex silk blend that Metsavaht developed, was like a red feather sticking up at the back of a headdress. And the tribes characteristic face paint was incorporated, to surprisingly sophisticated effect, in the sheer looks with graphic black lines. Bags were made from fish skin, an homage to the tribe's practice of using every part of the animal. It was a clever translation of a culture that is worlds away from New York Citys hustle and bustle, and one that will be as appreciated on these American streets as well as on the beaches in Metsavahts native Brazil. Beyond the feathers and face paint, what really inspired Metsavaht was the Ashninkas respect for beauty. The meaning of aesthetics is very important for them, he said. Beauty, for them, means strength and sensualityfor man or for woman. And thats exactly what fashion is. For Metsavaht, who juggles sustainability with a luxury sensibility, the Ashninka reinforced an idea about which he is already passionate: That fashion, frivolous though it may sometimes  be portrayed, is far from meaningless.$$I ask you for violence, in the nonsense, and you, you give me grace, your light and your warmth. Osman Yousefzada quoted a wonderful pang-of-passion Frida Kahlo love letter in his notes while references to both her art and her personal style were scattered here and there throughout this collection. The beaded tree decorations in the closing looks, some of the suiting and Stephen Joness take on Kahlos trademark headbands were among the most sharply drawn. Yet Yousefzada insisted, with a touch of weariness, that such accents were mere mood music: For me its just the same thing that I do again and again. Clothes, basically. Which I think women will want. And thats what its about. Well, yes. Whether women will want these clothes depends on the women. Certainly Osman has a fan base thats especially dedicated to his raved-about suite of pants. He is exploiting this happy niche not just by extending his selection of cuts, but by extending his market to the most pant-dependent constituencythis collection featured his first runway menswear, which starred notable horizontal moire corduroy jackets with a lapel shape imported from cutouts featured in his Fall womenswear collection. Although that beading looked fine and the silhouette was dramatic, Osmans closing yellow column dress was clearly a trial for the model to walk in. More harmonious amalgamations of theory and practice included the striking same-shade halter-neck tiered dress in waxed duchesse silk and his blown-up ikat brocade on blown-up silhouettes. The skirted three-tiered pants combined daintiness and jaunt. This collection featured a lot more flashes of grace than nonsense.$$Every valid fashion show has a built-in sense of its place in the world, of where the clothes fit in and where people are supposed to find it exciting and useful to wear them. Complex conceptual scenarios from deep within a designers brain can only fascinate so much if the clothes dont have any imaginable destination other than a fashion shoot or awards ceremony. So one of the subtexts running through this season is the need for fashion to readjust, widen its perspective, and stop excluding so many peoples realities. Smart creative minds can sketch in an environment subliminally, which is exactly what Julien Dossena was up to today at Paco Rabanne, as he ran a patched-in, mixed-up soundtrack on which the far-off noise of a live performance seemed to boom in the distance. Actually, that noise was heard at Chlo, too. And we all relate to what that means: festival sounds, the new massive social dressing-up opportunity for a generationfrom the beginning of every summer to its end. Dossenas collection nailed that context cleverly, merging high-tech sportiness with a sense of casual, disheveled sexiness. Bra-topped baby doll dresses, unraveling at the hems, walked alongside fitted motocross-influenced leathers, silver and khaki anoraks and parkas, track pants, and vaguely 70s sweaters printed with abstracted Native American motifs. On the feet: a practical, very cool series of suede cut-down biker-cum-Western boot-shoes ideal for coping with desert terrain, mud, and all-night dancing.   At the end, Dossena paid direct homage to Paco Rabannes signature space-age chain mail by showing slinky gold dresses and asymmetrical skirts roughed up around the edges with yarn chain stitching or thrown together with an army green sweater. Perfectly calibrated as potential stagewear or perhaps just for hanging out in a backstage VIP tent next summer. In the 60s, Paco Rabanne might have imagined wed all be living on the moon by 2015, but actually, this is really where weve landed.$$What do you want to wear? Thats the question that empire-builders Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor ask each other at the outset of their design process each season. Then they take a look at what Nash-Taylors daughter is currently wearing, and from that informal poll, they conjure a collection. This season, the duos proposition erred toward the hippie-ish, with asymmetrical knit dresses and skirts and slouchy graphic tees providing the contemporary counterpoint to such Easy Riderera staples as fringed suede jackets, embroidered peasant blouses, and studded leather miniskirts. There were other updates, toothe patchwork flares, for instance, were of trompe loeil denim-dyed French terry, and the frequently deployed camel-colored suede found its way into sporty items such as track pants. The designers want their casual clothes to wear like basics, but not look like them, and with that in mind, they embellished tees and sweaters with knot details and fringe, and finished numerous pieces with a mottled wash that added to the collections overarching vintage sensibility. The Pam & Gela clothes are flying out the door at the stores where theyre soldapparently, when Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor ask each other what they want to wear, they furnish an answer many young women agree with.$$Todays Pamella Roland affair was the inaugural fashion show to be staged at the Whitney Museum of American Arts new Meatpacking digs. If its somewhat surprising that that particular honor didnt go to an artsier designer, it should be noted that Roland does sit on the museums board and has been passionately involved in the new space since its earliest days. What, then, would a label that is fluent in mermaid dresses and marked by a kind of princess-y exuberance when it comes to full-throttle glamour offer up for a turn at this bastion of the avant-garde? As the designer put it backstage, You cant show in a museum and not do art.  Roland was especially interested in the work of Frank Stella, known for his large-scale geometric paintings in Technicolor palettes (a major retrospective bows at the Whitney in late October). She evoked that oeuvre in subtle ways. Some of her nicest propositions came through in a series of silk gowns whose fronts were folded up, origami-style, to expose the fabrics brilliantly hued undersides. Liquid organza was surprisingly techy in a floor-grazing blush number, but the huge floppy bow it appeared as on a column gown fell a little flat. Rolands real successes here were the ones in which Stellas spirit seemed to guide her most: the punchy and relatively spare pieces (though it was hard to deny that a wild-card crystal-encrusted jumpsuit would look pretty great on Mary J. Blige, who sat front-row). The more precious items, like a strapless, bubble-hemmed minidress in sea-foam with white roses, or a jewel-trimmed, 50s-feeling evening coat, seemed to run counter to both the designers message and the venue.$$No fewer than 11 graduates of Parsons School of Designs esteemed MFA program (Fashion Design and Society), which is touted as the first in the nation of its kind, both conceptual and skills based, showcased their thesis collections today. They were Katherine Mavridis, Liya Liu, Long Xu, Mayako Kano, Diletta Cancellato, Pengji Cai, Ryohei Kawanishi, Shih Hsun Lee, Sisi Liu, Tianfang Jing, and Varpu VernaHel Rapeli. If their collective output is anything to go by, the future of fashion will be a studiously creative place. Four of the students were on hand to discuss their work and used pitch-perfect industry parlance in doing so. Mavridis, from Australia, described her technique of weaving tightly coiled tubes into enormous shapes that hardly need a human body to fill them out. New Zealander Kano spoke of the delicacy of Meiji-period Japanese photographs, in particular the now-faded pigments used for preservation, to explain her lacy confections. Hailing from China, Liya Liu said New York Citys mountains of street garbage waiting for pick up inspired the nylon trash bags of her collection, almost none of which were actually sewn, as did the enormous amount of waste that goes on in the garment trade. And, most irreverent of all, Kawanishi looked to Dadaism to create the mundane, quotidian, stupid serious objects on his runway, ranging from a bath mat and a toilet paper dispenser to closet hangers and FedEx envelopes. Other strong showings came from Xu, who used a bamboo-weaving technique from his native China to craft his intricate multicolored pieces; Hsun Lee, the only mens designer this year, who combined  traditional mens tailoring and skateboard gear; Sisi Liu, who enlarged the ornamental flowers of her box-making hobby into large-scale 3-D versions; and Jing, also from China, who made her ethereal collection by printing folded paper with translucent film. In addition to the schools revered course director, Shelley Fox, Parsonss new dean of fashionand expert in sustainabilityBurak Cakmak was also on hand. One of the most important things we teach is that students should have fun, he said. We allow them to choose their own guiding principles. Cakmak replaces Simon Collins, Parsonss outgoing dean who was very visibly reveling in the fun his final students were having.$$Paul & Joe sent out a metallic pink embossed postcard as the invitation for its Spring show, but it may as well have been fronted with a photo of Miami. Thats where founder Sophie Mechaly mined references for a collection that was fun, frisky, and swathed in palm fronds. More precisely, she said she drew from Scarface and Magnum, P.I. to arrive at key looks such as the halter maxi dresses and slim, pastel pantsuits. Just as there will always be flora and fauna prints in a Paul & Joe collection, so too will there be modified denim, sweet flourishes (broderie anglaises, ruffle accents), and a boyish wink (shirts or shoes); the difference each season comes from how Mechaly doses them. The Miami throwback allowed for a new twist: retro jogging attire remixed as silk blousons and shorts or hybridized as a studded tuxedo pant. The theme also meant she could go gutsy on glitz, from the silver leather trousers to the sequined baby doll and the metallic boots. Just in case those pieces didnt sufficiently incite the spirits, she added a vintage-style T-shirt with the line Go for it. Mechaly was already wearing it, like a souvenir from the show.$$Paul Smith and his wife, Pauline Denyer Smith, were once couture show regulars and to this day one of Paulines prize possessions is the last Smoking ever made by Yves Saint Laurent. Preshow this afternoon, Sir Paul said, When you hold that suit, the weight is amazingit gives this lovely drape. Drape was one of the key preoccupations of this collection, which, while obviously not produced on a couture level, managed to force its fabrics elegantly to assert their designers will against the implacable tug of gravity. Thus, the first dressa silk-screened mlange of orange on two clashing patternssignaled the turned-up volume, Sir Paulstyle, of many of the looks that followed. The colors were drawn from David Hockney, while the disjunctive block shapes of the printed panels looked to be mined from Henri Matisse, appropriate enough for a show held at the Serpentine Galleries. Smith makes a masterful pant and is especially sensitive to the subtleties of the break. Todays finest broke lavishly on a pair that came wide-legged and pin-tucked in gray wool, worn under a matching jacket with a lean lapel that featured six mysteriously nonfunctional buttons. Elsewhere, a short-sleeved, asymmetrically hemmed jacket challenged the masculine codes from which it was drawn. The croc cross straps on colorful rubber-clad platforms echoed the built-in cross-body suspenders that recurred throughout the collection, while the houses newly boosted accessories team delivered some harmonious harmonica handbags and a tote so ingeniously colored that it seemed to be its own light source.$$In June, one year after the departure of founder Serge Cajfinger, Paule Ka named a new creative designer, Alithia Spuri-Zampetti. The 31-year-old Central Saint Martins grad comes directly from a six-year stint at Lanvin where, most recently, she was the head designer of womenswear. Market categories notwithstanding, the leap in sensibility between the two brands isnt a huge one; her background is probably very appealing for Paule Ka, which occupies an untapped nichecall it accessible elegancebut lacks the cachet. Spuri-Zampettis influence, however, will not be noticeable until next season, which means the current collection represents a studio-designed placeholder. And given the flux, it came across as sure and steady. Beyond the brands standby trapeze dress, there were several other day-to-night variations, each distinguished by some combination of polished fabric (crisp faille, fluid cloque, cotton tricotine) or punchy color (hibiscus, sky blue, citron). Everydayand every nightnovelty seemed to be the through line, from pastel brocade outerwear to a loosely interpreted tuxedo-style strapless dress. Bonus points if you identified the puzzle-piece pattern as M.C. Escher; applied here and there to skirts, dresses, and knits, it took a stronger stance than standard houndstooth. But the strongest design of all was a flattering sheath, slit from below the knee up each leg and fronted with a sculptural knot. On the hanger, it seemed sleek enough; on the body, it had a magic effect.$$The Martini-drinking Los Angeles stylist Shirley Kurata was the driving force behind Peter Jensens Spring 2016 show today. Jensen marked his 16th year in fashion and a return to the official London schedule with a no-holds-barred homage to Kuratas Pop Art sensibility. Inspiration certainly struck from close quarters this season. The eclectic stylist, who has recently been responsible for the red carpet reinvention of Lena Dunham, has worked on Jensens shows for some five years, after the pair hit it off at Vogues Fashions Night Out in New York City.  Jensens enduring affection for a 60s silhouette held fast this season. It was embodied here in a mod secretary look that meshed with what he explained as a vintage 80s vibe. This came through first and foremost in the fabricationwith cream skirt suits and shift dresses in toweling (a throwback to the designers time living in Hollywood, that motherland of the velour tracksuit), but also in the cacti-stitched polo shirts. The seasonless standouts were the pretty camera-print dresses worn over shirtingand the heavily sequined white socks and visors that finished every look. Jensen took the idea of the muse to its outer reaches both with the sweater that read Shirley, Shirley, Shirley and the step-and-repeat print comprised of hundreds of faceless Shirleys. This homage to the Tinseltown stylist was always going to have an emphasis on fun.$$Heres a query about long, flared culottes. Granted, they are being worn around the streets this season in their tailored form, but will they have legs next season in lemon or pale blue semi-sheer seersucker? Peter Pilotto took a gamble on them for Spring, and on the evidence he provided the answer is: Unlikely. For the past few seasons Pilotto has been carefully orienting his collections in a way that moves him away from being defined as a print designer. In this one, he decided to concentrate mainly on solid colors and diaphanous textures.The signature prints he made his name with were de-emphasized and reduced to graphic lines stamped with black on white circles and triangles that ran along segmented skirts. The stronger part of Pilottos vision for Spring lay in his reprise of the midi-skirted silhouette he innovated a while back, at a point when no-one else was thinking about that gracefully attenuated line. That proved prescient, and the continuation of that line, which today appeared with tailored sleeveless wrap-over jackets, worked to his advantage, as did the dresses and skirts, cut in pale layers of diaphanous lace. Along the way, Pilotto also picked up on some of the themes which are swirling in the fashion ether: drawstring details, tiered flounces, and asymmetrical frills. On the rack in stores, all of those things will no doubt have appeal as high summer fare. But do they stand out as recognizably Peter Pilotto? Thats debatable. Every young designer deserves the chance to develop, but sometimes customers are reluctant to let go of what they found compelling about a label in the first place.$$Get ready to hear a lot more about Phelan: The new label by former Alexander Wang knitwear designer Amanda Phelan launched this afternoon with a bang. The show, seated theater style, was led off by an extraordinary four-woman performance choreographed by Vim Vigor Dance Company founder Shannon Gillen, and it concluded with the assembly, onstage, of models clad in some of the most innovative looks to come from a young New York designer in quite some time. The rapturous applause was earned. The dance wasnt just for show. As Phelan explained, movement is key to her brands identity, and she wanted every element of her first collection, and its presentation, to speak to that theme. Its plainest expression was via the knits, which displayed a staggering level of technical invention: There were knits popcorned and puckered, ones gossamer sheer, and others patterned in graphic intarsia. The jaw-dropper was an accordion-knit silver dress that came off armor-like from a distance, but was revealed to be pliable and lightweight when studied close-up. Phelan was clearly stretching her knitwear muscles here, but she spent the wealth of her Wang experience in another way, too: Aside from a few longeurs, these were street-ready, commercial looks. Phelans movement theme also extended to the woven pieces. It was evident in an abstract brushstroke print, and in here-and-there fringe embellishment. A long cotton skirt was slit up the front to accommodate a long stride, and the blinding metallic pieces captured motion through light. Phelan made and remade the same point, but the sheer variety of ways she found to tell the same story kept the storytelling from feeling heavy-handed. If anything, the quibble here was that the looks the dancers wore, also by Phelan, werent included in the official runway collection. The dancers high-waisted, wide-leg cropped trousers demonstrated movement in the best way possiblethrough the furious aliveness of bodies.$$As hundreds of hands simultaneously lifted their personal screens to ensure by-proxy digestion of the sight in front of their eyesCourtney Love in ripped jeans sliding down a mechanical runway singing to the backing of two glow-eyed Terminator-touched robot guitaristsit was easy to see Philipp Pleins point. In his bare backstage office before this show, wired on Red Bull and super-stressed in the expectation of imminent catastrophe, he had observed: Our life today is dominated by machines and electronic gadgets. Like your phone is dominating your life and your navigation system is helping you to go from A to B. Without our gadgets it is really hard these days for us to survive. Which is true: When that show started there were very few people in the audienceand certainly not mewho werent holding up their machines to prove their presence in the room. Plein had decided to throw this Orwellian showthink Metropolis meets prt--porter meets Alexander McQueen Spring 99after watching the Alex Garlandscripted and directed film Ex Machina on a flight back to Italy from his second home in Los Angeles. The idea he had was to use robots to equip the models as they proceeded on conveyer belts down the catwalk. In stop-starts they moved forward, as if on an assembly line, and the industrial machines handed them their accessoriessunglasses, handbags, and the rest. It was a show to chill the hearts of stylists everywhere.  Yet when we met backstage, Plein had just learned that two weeks of programming had crashed and the robots werent working. He was kvetching hard-core. Luckily some adroit IT specialistperhaps  someone turned the robots off then on againmeant that by showtime (only 52 minutes late) all was as planned. Love bloomed forth, sang her song, and afterward the models made their chillingly passive progress down the runway. The collection (oh yes!) was an extension of the punk theme that Plein had plucked from the ether for his most recent menswear collection. He is a pop designer and the clothes are pop too. Many in fashion dismiss them as schlock, but there is design behind these clothes apparent paucity of it. Patched with fake album cover art and slogan badges and very often machine gunned with studs, these were as maximalist-ly expressed as his theme. They were obviouswhich is Pleins whole in-your-face MO.  Not long afterward, I found Love. She was settling into her chair at the post-show dinner. Asked if it was challenging to perform with robots, she said: Well, I rehearsed just once and it was quite scary. But actually, the robots were very well behaved. It was sliding down on the conveyorI had to rehearse that a few times. And was that her most bananas fashion show experience ever? No. But its up there.$$Lorenzo Serafini established himself as a dress man at his Philosophy debut for Fall 15. His second runway collection was very much an evolution of his first: Victoriana by way of the 70s, with a hint of the undone prairie girl. Erdem Moralioglu covered similar ground in London, but where his frocks had a special occasion sense of hauteur, Serafinis dresses are designed to be lived in. Wisps of floral-printed chiffon with tiny buttons left undone over lacy bits of lingerie paraded down the runway on glossy black cowboy booties, beguiling in their offhandedness.  David Hamiltons photography was on Serafinis mood board, and like the famous lensman, this designer idealizes the young. A cropped crocheted sweater worn with hip-slung chambray trousers exposed acres of midriff; broderie anglaise bloomers did the same for upper thighs. Those shorts might get an airing at Fashion Week a year from now, but otherwise theyre a nonstarter. Elsewhere a cowhide leather coat seemed like a too-obvious nod to Serafinis Western theme. As he settles into his new role, hell learn to avoid that kind of runway pratfall. Serafinis promise lies in his easy way with a silk dress, from a pale mint drop-waist style to the lace inset slips and nightshirts with shorter-in-front and longer-in-back hems that ended the show. Extrapolate on numbers like that and keep at the crafty knits he paired with them, and hell be onto something.$$Brava, Phoebe English. At her presentation today, the up-and-coming designer began in earnest to deliver on her tremendous potential. This was Englishs most fully fleshed-out collection to date, filled with varied wearable pieces that expressed her distinctively dreamy point of view. Displacement was the theme here, imparted in everything from the askew cut of a simple camisole to the stutter effect of the three-layered pieces of fabric on the front of a flax-canvas sleeveless jacket. English often talks about wanting her clothes to have a sense of immediacy, a feeling she conveys via techniques that can come off as naive. That sleeveless jacket, though, was one of the garments here that betrayed her sophistication as a designer: The jacket was tailored through the back, and the topmost piece of fabric layered in the front had a nattily finished blazer pocket. Lots of designers play with deconstruction; English was genuinely deconstructing. Details like that jacket pocket werent the first things that jumped out at you about Englishs new clothes. There was, of course, the signature handfuls of tulle that English applied to create her gauzy effects; there were also sui generis embellishments, like the rope-draped velvet frills that looked, not unappealingly, like scrunchies. And English introduced some intriguing new textures here, such as string embroidery and a material made by re-weaving torn-up strands of silk. The re-woven silk pieces were a highlight of the collectionthe fabric itself was beautiful, and English added to its expressiveness by leaving the ends of the silk ribbon dangling to create an irregular fringe. The real development here, though, was in the collections accessibility. Another highlight of this outing were the matter-of-fact culottes, slashed on both legs near the hem. The gesture of the slash sufficed to announce Englishs presence in the garment, but you could easily imagine it as a mix-and-match go-to piece in a cool girls closet. Ditto the slip-like silk skirts, and those nicely askew camisoles. English has gone a long way this season toward figuring out how to diffuse her voice through the kinds of items that make a wardrobe. Expect more and better to come: Thats not a lesson designers unlearn.$$For the launch of Piazza Sempiones Spring collection, the label again embraced a collaboration with the art world, tapping R di Martino, a talented Italian video artist whose emotional yet elegant visual language has been widely acclaimed. She was commissioned to make a short film, called A Day of Wonder, shot in Marrakech and inspired by the cult movie Cat People, a 1942 film noir depicting an exotic atmosphere full of danger and mystery. Di Martino captured the sensuality of a lush Moroccan walled garden, where a beautiful woman was lounging poolside. Obviously she was clad in a Piazza Sempione cotton kaftanwhich she ditched pronto when, after fluctuating lazily between dreams and reality and upon hearing a terrifying roar, she jumped hurriedly into the pool for safety. There she was surrounded by a surreal play of lights reflected on the water like a deceitful net. The finale revealed the illusory nature of her fearsas well as the Moroccan inspiration of a collection which, in an abundant stream ofreferences, also mentioned a novel by the Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun. Ideas from North African garb were translated into clean lines and comfortable shapes in a lineup where tunics, capes and elongated dresses had an easy, casual feel, yet were elegant in their fluid simplicity. Colors were warm and natural; micro geometric patterns were inspired by zelliges, the traditional colorful tiles adorning the walls of mosques and palaces. They also served as the starting point for the digital work of artist Najia Mehadji, whose pulsating images of flowers were reworked on printed silk, poplin, and duchesse.$$Everyone says that the fashion business is changing. For this reporters money, the best evidence of the week so far came at Polo Ralph Laurens rooftop presentation, where Selena Gomez (43.5 million Instagram followers) and Brooklyn Beckham (4.2 millionnot bad for a celebrity offspring) took in the tableaux vivant side by side. Considering the access to all the eyeballs that millennial celebrities can provide a brand, a journalist cant help but wonder if her kinds days are numbered.  While I still have your attention, a thought on the company and its new Spring collection: Nobody knows their own brand better than Ralph Lauren knows his. One season fashion leans minimal, the next it sways vintage nerd-chic, but Polos all-American style is eternal. Exiting the stairwell into the bright sunshine of The McKittrick Hotels Gallow Green, Gomez and Beckham were greeted by a denim grouping which produced two of the afternoons strongest looks: a faded jumpsuit with metal hardware that was as slouchy as a three-piece denim suit was slim. Section two had a Western flavor. Fringe may be absolutely everywhere at the moment, but let the record stand, Lauren got there first.  Group three is where Lauren turned on the brights, tying the sleeves of a fuchsia cable-knit crew around the shoulders of a coral red minidress, layering an electric orange schoolgirl blazer over a Bengal-stripe shirtdress, and reuniting that definitive preppy combination of pink and green on a linen blazer and skinny jeans. Floral-print sundresses were accessorized with floral-print bags of many different shapes and sizes. By comparison, the guys khaki suiting came off staid. Classic isnt a bad thing when it comes to menswear, but for the preppy peacock, Lauren had a vibrant red firemans jacket.$$Natasa Cagalj is a designer who believes in allowing her experiences as a woman, a mother, and a friend to other women to inform the way she designs. The ideas for the collection she put together for Spring started, she relatedwhile pulling out an oversize poplin top, printed with circles and flowerswhen she was on the beach in Croatia this summer. These are the simple potato prints my children made on holiday, she said. Im half Croatian, half Slovenian, and used to spend four weeks on the beach every year in Croatia as a girlI always used to bring ribbons and tape and paper and paints with me to make things, just to stop myself being bored. She smiled. So now its a family tradition that me and my sister and all our children always do the same thing every year. The sense of a lifestyle, craftiness, and do-it-yourself resourcefulness ran through the collection, which was based around building a wardrobe of pinstriped shirting pieces, pants, knitwear, soft tailoring, and dresses. Cagalj, whose studio is in London, says shed like to take the stress out of dressing for busy women who have work, family, and business travel to contend with. I had this thought of how nice it would be to go to bed in your hotel room in your pajamas and bathrobe and maybe just get up and go out in them! How many fashion women in a zombie state of tiredness at the shows will relate to that?$$When a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 of this year, Kathmandu-raised Prabal Gurung mobilized quickly, using his social media platforms to call for donations. Since then, about a million dollars have been raised for the quakes victims by the Shikshya Foundation Nepal, on the board of which he sits. Backstage tonight he was feeling gratitude. If it wasnt for the fashion industry, I wouldnt have been able to do it. His show started with a thank-you: some 30 monks clad in their traditional red and yellow robes, hands clasped in prayer, chanting. The collection, too, had its roots in Nepal. The work of artist Laxman Shreshtha, who Gurung said he grew up studying, became a jacquard on skin-baring evening separates, the orange and yellow Holi powder hues of which formed the shows warm, lit-from-within palette. Last season Gurung took a turn for the minimal, and he was on a similar path for Spring. Simple pieces like a bias-cut chiffon column in pale yellow or a sleeveless black-and-white guipure lace sheath were the ones that resonated. Gurung has a tendency to overembellish from time to timea printed dress with a skin-baring hand-tacked seam at the waist, and another dress with a cluster of cutouts below its plunging neckline were two looks that wouldve benefited from a little more restraint. By the end, however, he was in his groove. The trio of body-skimming, brightly colored finale gowns were stripped of all the extras. They looked sensational.$$Subverting traditional classics: That was the line transmitted about the Prada collection by design director Fabio Zambernardi backstage in the absence of Miuccia Prada, who was sadly unable to be there this season due to the passing of her aunt. If Miuccia was elsewhere, her aesthetic was fully present in a collection which literally stayed within narrow lines. It was an essay on skirt suits and coats, bisected with a graphic theme of vertical stripes, and accompanied by a wealth of her quirky accessories, signature embellishments and the swish of dozens of dangly earrings as big as Christmas-tree baubles. The news from Milan so far has been about retro-eclecticism drawn through an Italian sensibility. Well, if anyone is the mother of all that, it's Miuccia Prada, who has been writing the encyclopedia on it, with PhD-level footnotes and wittily allusive fashion-changing asides, for decades. This collection trod firmly on her home territory, shod in an array of elegant low-heeled shoes, each pair made in its own delicious configuration of pointiness, ankle-strapping, metallic leather, patent and suede. As for the suits, they came in collages of checks, tweeds, and stripes, sometimes in leather and suede, here and there in transparent prints. What to make of this? For one thing, Miuccia Prada pays no heed to weather-appropriateness. In her viewwhich is a global onetheres as much need for pieced fur coats in summer as there is for skimpy silk slip dresses, which she optionally layers over chunky knits. Theres the question of proportions, tooher loosened shoulder line and boxy shapes, and a series of waist-length jackets in brown suede and leather, could well prove influential. The show ended with a siren call to Pradas wealthiest constituencies: coats in metallic snakeskin and suede stripes, and beautifully desirable organza suits and coats decorated with outsize transparent pailletted flowers. One way or another, all those looks are destined to be broken down and distributed as trophies all over the realms of young Hollywood, the art world, weddings, and special occasions that Miuccia Prada knows so well.$$Forecast: Next summer will be about prettiness, romance, ruffles, and laceor at least it will be for the portion of female humanity whos naturally into that. But what if youre not? Preen by Thornton Bregazzi is a collection that might meet you halfway: Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi are a couple who know how to put an English edge on a ruffle and a flash of sex in a fluttery print frock. Not surprising: Theyre based in Notting Hill and started their business in the 90s in a concrete bunker under the overpass on Portobello Road. Versed in the history of subversive alternatives as they are, they can easily turn their hands to punk-ifying a Princess Diana Shy Di blouse with a couple of D-rings and straps, or making that whole yoke and frill shape in startlingly erotic sheer black lace. Thornton and Bregazzi said theyd been looking at contemporary dance, particularly at Michael Clark, and wanted a sense of beautiful romance in the collection. The opening dress, a dusty pink with sprigged flowers and a falling-off-shoulder line, captured that fluidity of movement in a Stevie Nicks sort of waya trend thats continuing since the New York shows. Then came a lot of slim lace dresses, layered over short skirts, which had cutout patches on the sleeves that had been re-appliqud with guipure flowers. If they slightly trod on territory Christopher Kane mapped out at the beginning of his career, and other moments brought back memories of some of Nicolas Ghesquires Balenciaga collections, thats only a quibble. Otherwise, it was, as always, a confident showing of what their audience likes best.$$A Georgian townhouse on Fitzroy Square was the serene setting for the first showing of Preen Lines Spring 2016 collection. It was a chance for the designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi to indulge their magpie spirit with a series of vintage-inspired pieces that had their frequent stomping ground, Portobello Market, at heart. Rainbows and flowers in satin stitch embroidery, with more than a hint of the Haight-Ashbury hippie, nodded to the 70s needlework of Ossie Clark. It crept across the sleeves of a white double pleat denim jacket, and onto a series of seriously desirable two-tone suede pieces that included a belted shirtdress and button-front A-line skirt. Preen-staple floaty dresses were amplified with acidic yellow and pink checks on chiffon and stretch drill fabrics that hit a hard-edged, punky note. Once again, the joy of Preen Line was in its ability to pull elements from countercultures and transform them into the kind of everyday essentials that smart, hardworking woman want and need. There was much for them to choose from in this sprawling 70-piece collection, which overall was an altogether softer proposition than Fall, though the graphic stripes that featured so heavily that season also found their way onto cropped sweatshirts and monochrome tank tops here. A standout was the zigzag sweater, which injected some much-needed West London glam into this quiet corner of Bloomsbury.$$Although Massimo Nicosias press notes quoted him as saying this collection reflects an ethereal holiday in Scotland, it would be highly inadvisable to pack these clothes for a real vacation in Braveheart territory. Because, seriously: If you didn't freeze to death, the midges would eat you alive. That trifling quibble apart, this was an often-lovely, highly shootable potpourri of technically impressive work. Nicosia is a percolator, a thinker, and this season he was trying to step back behind Pringle of Scotland's thick-knit lambswool curtain into more elemental territory. The deep-V punched argyle intarsia in the debut look pointed to the rustication and sublimation ahead. Rubberized string and leather tape were the fronds that twined below faux-naif floral details pinned to the chest and hip of faux-crochet (faux-chet?) loose woven dresses. Sliced panels of silk in diamond formation were more argyle salutations, whilst the fishing-net open stitching was Nicosia's nod to the installation pieces of artist Ernesto Neto. All this carefully wrought, through-a-prism primitivism worked pragmatically in the net bags and stitched sandals. To further entangle this collection's complicatedly knotted self-referential pitch at distillation, that orange stitching was in fact digitally printeda computer-realized simulacrum of an artisan technique.$$The things you hear backstage. Tonight at Proenza Schouler, Lazaro Hernandez declared, We were looking at bananas, things that peel away from the body. The designer and his partner, Jack McCollough, turned out an audacious collection for Spring, one that solidified their recent preoccupations with texture, decoration, and asymmetry, and produced some of the most knockout dresses of the week. Spain seemed to be a starting point, what with the black, white, and red color palette; the ruffles and the exposed shoulders; and the pom-poms that traced the edges of dresses and jackets in broderie anglaise. But this wasnt the straightforward interpretation of Spanish influences that Peter Coppings was at Oscar de la Renta last night. Two shirtdresses that spilled off the shoulders (fashions current favorite erogenous zone) turned to reveal a crisscross of straps; the hem of another dress was connected via a series of tied knots, and the back was cut out of a knit dress with flamenco ruffles. Tailored pieces were stripped of their closures; velvet ribbons that looped through metal grommets and tied in bows kept patch-worked jacquard jackets and vests from falling open. All of which brings us back to Hernandezs peeling bananas. The Proenza boys have long been New York Citys most craft-obsessed young designers. With a new investor announced earlier this year, their ambitions are bigger than ever. Here and there the details were overdoneseen all together, those bows surely looked too busy. But when they were on, they were on. Tops in our books was a series of narrow midi dresses with ruffles, cutouts, and fil coupe dots. Feathered numbers made by shooting a rod through each quill to create a mesh grid were truly special. As for accessories, the pointy-toed mules with metal ring detailing, lacing at the ankles, and low mirrored heels rank right up there with the best of New York City, too.$$Creative director Kate Wendelborn may have recently left Protagonist, but Spring found the hyper-soign label born of The Line in fighting form, albeit with a slightly more conservative tenor. The studio team hewed close to its aesthetic foundations; clean lines, immaculate fabrications, and unfussy luxury. The latter was paramount for Spring straight out of the gate: to wit, a spare robe coat in buttery suede andwait for ita chocolate croc bolero. A piece like that might easily feel anachronistic, downright patrician even, but in the closet of the Protagonist woman (sitting as it no doubt does alongside tattered 501s and white tees) it reads as a serious statement. Itll team dreamily with one of this seasons lookbook shoe stylesBirks  la Blahnik good enough to make you pray theyll make it into production. Their androgynous appeal was echoed in rakish pajama tops, which borrowed a classic mens shape and added a simple tie to cinch the waist.  A grouping of straightforward black nylon jackets came up strong on utilitarianism; still, theyd hardly have been missed within this generally singular lineup. Shirting, an emphasis for the brand from day one, was as covetable as ever, with pieces alternately crisp and louche with wide cuffs, or with shawl collars and delicate button detailing. Those closures were equally effective on a slit-to-there pencil skirt, which was risqu without being showy, and evocative to boot.$$The pressures on for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne. The Public School designers unveil their debut collection for DKNY in a few days time, and it was reasonable to expect that the duos need to deliver for their new corporate masters would result in a Public School show that looked, well, distracted. Instead, Chow and Osbornes DKNY assignment seems to have prompted them to think even harder about Public School, and how to bring the brands clothes a real sense of elevation. A sophisticated tone was set with the first pair of looks, two streetwise yet soign ensembles that featured terrific, softly pleated palazzo pants. Here, at last, was the payoff for all the effort Chow and Osborne have put in the past few seasons to bring more dimension and fluidity to their womens looks. And indeed, the highlights of this collection found them exploring dimension and fluidity with a fresh sense of fluency. Those qualities were there in spades in, for instance, a chic belted gilet of sand-toned raffia, multiple parachute-inspired coats, and the silky maxi dresses that read as a sporty take on that lean Haider Ackermann silhouette. The latter looks didnt read as derivative. They did, however, feel grown up. Chow and Osborne said after the show that they were imagining the Public School girl gone abroad, on far-flung travels seeking to find herself. Thats a grab bag of a concept, one that invites a lot of drift, and where Chow and Osborne faltered here was in the looks that digressed from the collections overarching urban-nomad vibe. A tennis sweateresque knit dress, for instance, seemed out of sync with the rest of the show; ditto the sculpted wrap skirts and button-downs with graphic contrast piping. The designers werent wrong to want to interrupt the parade of diaphanous looks with something a little sharper, but they did that to better effect when they introduced, say, slender ribbed tunics with tonal horizontal stripes. Those pieces expressed the signature Public School geometry, but elegantly and with understatement. If thats what comes of turning up the pressure on Osborne and Chowbring it on.$$Was a new Wes Anderson flick filming at The Plaza Hotel this morning? No, it was just that Rachel Antonoff had taken over The Plazas storied Palm Court to stage her labels fantastical Spring presentation. A branch structure encircled the rooms central bar, and the plush carpets were strewn with torn paper, pinecones, Coleman lamps, and the like. All around were exquisite 3-D paper birds. With a theme of birding, Antonoff envisioned the seasons protagonist, Edith Finch, a slightly dotty (if not downright deranged) woman. We dont know if its all in her head, Antonoff offered. She might be the only person at camp. There was also a dose of Troop Beverly Hills. The set was an ultra-involved imagining of what the Womens Aviary Society Annual Birding Weekend might look like. In keeping with the quietly sinister undertone, models posed casually with, say, an ax (more Misery than Troop BH) or a bow and arrow. Whats more, one of those paper birds came shot, bleeding tiny crimson paper droplets. There were sweet, Carmen Mirandaesque fruit prints; itty-bitty cropped novelty T-shirts (Tiny Tee, read a particularly meta one); and 50s-style frocks. The camp/birding themes hit their zenith in the counselor get-upskhaki colored with all manner of ornithological flair. The chickadee patches were darling, but there was an authoritarian dowdiness to those pieces that may make them a tough sell for Antonoffs clientele. What theyll go gaga for is the pure 90s slip dress in a candy-colored pastel floral jacquard and the eyelet column gown.$$This was a watershed moment. Tonights Rachel Comey dinner-cum-show at Pioneer Works in Red Hook unfolded a little differently than ones past: As opposed to filing out in a series of looks between courses, Comeys models came out once this evening, en masse. And most of them werent models, at least not in the sense that the term is usually understood. These were dancers of varying ages, colors, and sizes, from the robbinschilds company, with which Comey collaborated on a video presentation for Resort. They were fitted in characteristically easy-going looks that suited each womans shape, and as they took their leisurely turns down the ersatz runway between the dinner tables, they asserted an aura of self-possession and authority. The dancers looked like interesting, stylish women you might encounter on the street. That was Comeys point, of courseto validate the reality of her clothes, rather than setting them up as a fantasy that potential customers might wish to enter into. Many people in the audience said afterwards that they were moved. It seems a bit glib, after that coup de thetre, to talk about individual pieces. But Comeys collection did underscore her themethe emphasis was on fabrics that felt soft and looked lived in; experienced somehow. To wit, the stonewashed velvet that Comey used in slouchy suits and one excellent, duster-length trench, and the vegetable-dyed leathers and emphatically distressed denim. A sense of things being in process pervaded the collections shapes, as well: These were fitted closer to the body, in general, than Comey is usually wont to do, but they frequently featured dangling scarf-like hems or other kinds of asymmetries to create dimension and dynamism. There were standout pieces, alongside that velvet trench, and sundry details worth calling out, but they all served Comeys larger point, which was to validate the fact that these clothes were made for living. Which is a thing that real, interesting women do.$$After a turning point for Rachel Zoes eponymous line back in Resort, you hoped the designer and her team would be able to keep up their momentum in reviving the formerly fatigued label. And at yesterday's presentation, they generally succeeded. At the risk of sounding like a broken record in characterizing the mega-stylists design sensibilities, her woman doesnt vary too much from season to season, even if the locale does periodically (Morocco, or Carnaby Street): gypset luxe, with a Bianca Jaggeresque ratio of uptown polish and downtown bohemia. Zoes clothes continue to take on a more aspirational quality. Spring's tasseled suede topper felt a long way from the parade of filmy pussy-bow blouses from seasons gone by. There was a sense of luxury to it, and to pieces like a beaded and fringed vest in cream-color upholstery, or the tasseled suede toppers. The designers suiting, meanwhile, was more compelling than ever before: Opulently slouchy pajama styles stole even the heart of this Fashion Weekweary reporter. A few looks felt superfluous; the diaphanous yellow maxi dress was surely nice and shoppable, but perhaps not distinctive enough to warrant its place in the runway edit. Nevertheless, this collection was another savvy step in the reinvigoration of the Rachel Zoe brand.$$Did it make any difference that Rag & Bone decided to show in Brooklyn? Not in the sense of having any material effect on the pictures you see here, in which the background and lighting are indistinguishable from any other professional production in New York. Yet theres a yearning among many designers now to get back to some feeling of authenticityor rather, any feeling at all that takes people out of the usual show rut. And in the case of Rag & Bone designers David Neville and Marcus Wainwright, that meant deciding to invite their audience to partake of something privately meaningful to them on both the local and the stylistic levels: to wit, a collection that re-channeled the 90s of the designers youth, and in a community arts center, St. Anns Warehouse, which they both revere as a stage graced by Lou Reed and other members of the Velvet Underground generation. A swift read out in terms of clothes revealed slightly different reference points, though. Backstage, Wainwright said that the midi tube dresses and hoop earrings were derived from his memories of going to the Notting Hill Carnival in London in the late 90s, and all the army-surplus references to MA-1 jackets, parkas, and ribbed sweaters came from the huge collection of military clothes Ive had since before we even began this thing. Add in some slip dresses, technorave sportswear, mesh, and track pants, and there you have it. The truth is that the Rag & Bone guys are, of course, English. They came to the United States and made it on a commercial scale, which would never have been possible on British resources in such quick order. Now Wainwright is so deeply embedded in New York that he sees Brooklyn, where he lives, as home. Inviting his audience to drive out to visit his adopted neighborhood at nine at night was no big ask, in his mind, but more of an act of solidarity with a community. Giving back is always good.$$U.S.R.L. 1967, the patch on a white shirt announced. Jessica Chastain, Julianne Moore, and the rest of us were transported oceanside at Ralph Laurens show this morning. To use a maritime expression, the designer found his sea legs for Spring. Accessories ranged from captains hats to souvenir straw bags to the sort of cork platforms you see in resort towns. As for the clothes, they hewed to the RL standards: preppy yacht-clubbing essentials in a vivid all-American color palette, and cable sweaters draped over shoulders or wrapped around waists. Amid the large offering of navy and tan leather jackets, there was at least one of his de rigueur double-breasted blazers. The seafaring theme was particularly hard to miss in a series of looks in a super-bold, geometric sail print. This was one of Laurens most literal-minded collections in some time, but if the designer and his styling team mightve used a lighter touch to convey the seasons crisp, sporty message, piece by piece there were great clothes. A color-blocked sleeveless jumpsuit had the graphic punch of nautical flags. Clingy knit dresses that took cues from athletic swimsuits looked like theyd be fun to wearin particular, the evening versions with their sexy, strappy backs. And who doesnt love a striped knit? Speaking of stripes, the stars of the show were the evening dresses in cotton broadcloth shirting fabric: haute silhouettes in a humble fabric.$$Whos Raquel Allegras biggest fan? Judging from the designers New York Fashion Week debut, a whole lot of women. Thursdays presentation drew a buzzing crowd, and women from top boutique buyers to a radiant Marisa Tomei grabbed her for selfies. Despite years of showing her collections only on an appointment basis, Allegra is a well-established presence in the industry, and yesterday was vivid testimony to that fact. Allegras work has always been heavily marked by the bohemian, and Spring found her embracing it wholly. Models stood at the edges of a floral mandala created by close friends of the designer, and a psychedelic soundtrack (the 13th Floor Elevators, anyone?) was piped in over the system.  Recent seasons have found the designer expanding her purview, integrating other materials into her signature vernacular of supple jersey: denim, lace, leathereven some rabbit fur for Resort. Likewise, there was a lot of newness to be had here: floral separates and dresses in a more conspicuously print-y print than shes shown in past, something for the guys (a Spring mens capsule will be available exclusively at Barneys), and, wait for itfootwear. Coolest were a pair of leather slip-ons that Allegra dubbed the baby of a creeper and a ballet flat. In a lot of ways, that was an apt description for the seasons offering on the whole. Allegras got an evident romantics soul, but some of the best pieces here were the ones that spoke to a punkier edge and pushed her established boundaries a bit. Take the sheer layering pieces in her trademark cobwebby shredding, or a short-sleeved, fringe leather jacket, shown with a top and wide-leg trouser in a murky green and black stripe. She may be a big proponent of oversized pieces, but Allegra surely knows her way around great soft tailoring.$$One gets the feeling that Rebecca Minkoffs customer might be most familiar with the designers seasonal muses from, say, a Pinterest board. Still, if Minkoff can turn on her young clientele to the likes of Patti Smith or Franoise Hardy, as some of the icons she's envisioned through her kicky clothes, more power to her. For Spring, the inspiration was Marianne Faithfull, whom Minkoff discussed backstage in terms of both her sweetness and her rebelliousness. The designer nodded to that duality with her color story, opening the collection with a parade of virginal ivory, cream, and bone, which soon gave way to plenty of black. The Minkoff girl at her baddest (and coolest) came in an homage to Faithfull as seen in The Girl on a Motorcycle: a lightened-up take on the black leather jumpsuit she wears in the film. Shapes here were a mishmash of the Mod (a sweet suede shift) and the bohemian (maxi tank dresses with a nice flyaway sleeve detail). The hemlines were short, and the designers footwear of choicea pared-back knee-high gladiator with colored Lucite heelscame up long on appeal.$$One reason Rebecca Taylor is a highlight among contemporary designers is that she trusts her instincts. Rather than reinterpret last seasons trends or cobble together an obscure reference, she taps into what women are craving, whether its a Victorian neckline or something less defined, like a freer, more experimental approach to getting dressed. For Spring she was feeling midi lengths, baby boot-cut pants, and less volume overalldetails that feel right this season, but you cant quite put your finger on why. A-line skirts skimmed the hips before gently flaring out, and off-the-shoulder dresses with big ruffles flattered the arms; they were the kind of pieces that draw you to the rack because theyre pretty, not because they reference a particular decade or mood.  Taylor is known for her eccentric feminine prints, and this season she indulged her love of the Bloomsbury Group, a collective of English artists, philosophers, and writers from the early 1900s. She flipped through a heavy coffee-table book and pointed out paintings and drawings that were mirrored in the collections rich florals. Several looks had different prints patchworked together, as if she couldnt choose a favorite; a V-neck, ankle-length dress with capped sleeves was a real standout.$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli swapped Seattle for the Petit Trianon this season. And given the designers penchant for embroideries and point desprit, Marie Antoinette proved to be a much more natural inspiration than Kurt and Courtney. While Falls grunge references came off somewhat literallywho looks to Red Valentino for a lumberjack shirt, after all?these riffs on eighteenth-century styling seemed more subtle. Take the ruffled corsetry, which lent a new, insouciant charm to the jumpsuit, a popular silhouette that has been in need of a refresh. Since taking the reins at this label, Chiuri and Piccioli have made all things A-line their signature. The hourglass corsets count as genuine news for the duoreason enough to give this little sister line a closer look for Spring. The real stars of the collection, though, were the cap-sleeve, slightly empire-line dresses in delicate layers of lace, hand-embroidered with wildflowers or beaded here and there with small birds. We expect to see Hollywoods young royals in them all awards season long.$$Reem Acra, a Lebanon native, wanted to show who she was in this collection by combining her past and present life. Acra tied the two together quite literally by using the belt as a jumping-off point. I was going to flea markets all over the world and collecting belts off of people! she said. The accessories had intricate nods to traditional Middle Eastern beading and were embedded into short dresses, highlighting the midsection for a nice bloom-at-the-waist emphasis. The detail became a figure-complementing necessity with pieces like a floral-print V-neck dress with a tulle overlay that cascaded over the shoulders, as well as an orange scoop-neck shirt paired with a twisted aqua skirt. While most of the belts seemed plucked straight from a bazaar in Beirut, not everything was quite as homage paying. There was an almost bohemian, through-the-looking-glass version that was common in the 60s. That factor came through in a metallic-whipped dress with poet sleeves, patterned with paisleys, doused in a groovy palette of lime greens, lavenders, and pinks. A strappy, thigh-skimming chiffon dress was slathered in midnight blue sequins and had dcolletage that dipped into the waist.  But it was the floor-skimming gowns that were Acras strong point, and they fully exemplified her meticulous attention to detailthose were full of far-flung, romantic flou. A crimson robe dress secured with a metal-looking clasp belt had strips of emerald beading that lined the opening, eventually curving around the neck for a sliver of sex appeal, while a caftan gown with gold edging and bright red embroidered florals injected a dose of modesty. Both versions would be nice to see on the red carpet this coming awards season.$$Its easy to think about fashion at the surface level: What makes us feel comfortable, beautiful, powerful, sexy? Most people dont go beyond that to consider how the current state of culture affects their wardrobes, but it plays a big part in what we buy. Rie Yamagata, for example, doesnt approach design with a specific theme or dramatic twist in mind; she just wants to make clothes that cool girls would wear in New York City, Tokyo, and everywhere in between. She thinks about what women crave and, more importantly, why we crave it. Her starting point for Spring 2016 was the Southwest, but she couldnt quite put her finger on how she got there: I think with all the technology happening right now, I just wanted everything to feel natural, she said. We used a lot of natural silks that feel so good against the body. I didnt want to use many synthetics.  Words like crafty and artisanal were thrown around the presentation space a lot: You could think of them as the inverse of selfie and wearable tech. A cream silk georgette gown with black trim had the potential to be the perfect one-step summer party uniform, while nubby jacquard jackets and skirts with unfinished hems lent a bit more structure. Even the prints felt just slightly undonea poppy floral was vaguely surreal on a wide-leg jumpsuit, and a few silk dresses featured a blown-up pixel weave print that mimicked fuzzy plaid and houndstooth. But one of the simplest pieces managed to sum up the collection best: A sleek ivory column with a hand-knotted macram placket was equally suited for day and night and nailed that easy yet special balance that feels so fresh right now.$$In a recent interview, actress Carey Mulligan complained about the fact that the characters she plays are often described as strong women. That label, she said, makes it seem as though strength in a woman is the exception, not the norm. And it rubs her the wrong way. Its not uncommon to experience a similar frisson backstage at a fashion show, when a designer says that his (or her) collection pays tribute to strong womenthe message is always well meant, but by setting up strength as a quality found only in a particular type of woman, it demeans the fairer sex as a whole. At his latest show, Rick Owens put paid to that way of thinking. Owens latest coup de thtre wasnt a tribute to strong women; it was a tribute to female strength. Thats a major distinction. Chanteuse Eska, who performed last year with Owenss wife, Michle Lamy, at the Meltdown Festival in London, presided over this evenings proceedings, singing the theme song from the film Exodus. As she sang, models exited in new Rick Owens lookssome of which, like the sleeveless dusters and crinkled anoraks, registered as atypically accessible silhouettes, while others, such as the short dresses collaged from canvas and leather, reiterated Owenss signature sculptularity in a new, almost dreamlike tone. Periodically, the dfil was interrupted by an incredible sight: a woman, dressed by Owens, carrying another woman down the long length of the runway. Their bodies were yoked together; sometimes the women being carried hung upside down, legs slung over their partners shoulders. Other women were strapped on like backpacks. Speaking before the show, Owens said hed been thinkingwondering, reallyabout the ways women nurture others, metaphorically taking on another human beings weight. That inquiry was communicated forcefully by the shows staging. The carrying women, with their human freight, also suggested the physical labors of pregnancyan undercurrent amplified by the Owens silhouettes featuring distended volumes that were almost carbuncular. When the last model crossed the catwalk, wearing a short dress and one of those terrifically commercial crinkled anoraks, she looked sublimely unburdeneduntil you noted the straps crisscrossing the jacket in back. Even the most sylph-like, seemingly footloose and fancy-free woman is prepared, at any moment, to shoulder a weight. That, at any rate, appeared to be Owenss message in making those load-bearing straps his shows closing image. All women are strong. Even the ones who dont know it yet.$$Peter Dundas has a reputation as a classy designer. In his varied career, hes proven his talents at Emanuel Ungaro (doing haute Parisian), Revillon (fur), and Emilio Pucci (sexy rock-chick dressing). Now Dundas has circled back to Roberto Cavalli, the house where he began his careerand where, incidentally, Balmains Olivier Rousteing was once his assistant. Over the past couple of years, the competition among labels to capture the imagination of a new generation has resulted in a remarkable changing of the guard. The domino effect started with Hedi Slimanes democratizing, youth-cult-y success at Saint Laurent; it flowed on through Alessandro Micheles eclectic, vintage-y takeover at Gucci; and most recently it hit New York, putting Public School in charge at DKNY. For his Cavalli comeback, Dundas has handled the commercial situation by sidestepping the haute and embracing street and nightclub-wear with an 80s spin. The result: skimpy body-con dresses, high-waisted animal-print jeans and leggings, sleeveless biker jackets, bandeau tops tied in pouf-y bows on one shoulder, and prom skirts trailing giant frilled trains in their wake. There is nothing wrong with tinkering with 80s styling per seMiuccia Prada, Jonathan Anderson, and Christopher Kane are all dab hands at playing with Princess Di yoked collars, pumped-up Gloria von Thurn und Taxis leg-of-mutton sleeves, and jangling Christian Lacroix-meets-Memphis color and pattern. Theres a fine line of irony, though, which divides the intriguingly kitsch from the literal and cheap looking. Dundas was on sure ground when he tailored leather into neat jackets and sexy pants; these showed his long-standing expertise as a cutter and fitter for beautiful young girls bent on having a good time. But Dundas still needs to find that difficult balance between accessibility and designer leadership. He has all the talent and experience it takes, and a huge swath of friends and goodwill following him. His track record suggests that by next season, hell have it figured out.$$Gala Dal, wife of Salvador, was Alessandro DellAcquas muse for Spring. Shes a fitting inspiration for the designer, who has imbued his version of Rochas with whimsy and hyperbole. Both were in evidence in his new Spring collection, which featured torso-spanning bows, beaded giraffe embroideries, and shiny retro bras and briefs (patent? plastic?) underneath lace dresses. And that was just DellAcqua getting stared. There were also jailhouse stripes on a pinafore dress, an Alessandro Michele for Gucci pantsuit moment, and anachronistic graphic tees layered under clouds of white organza. Not unlike his No. 21 collection in Milan last week, this Rochas outing strained under the weight of all DellAcquas ideas. Thats too bad, because there were gems in the mix, like the loose-fitting slip dresses he cut in several different fabrics, prettiest of all a colorful jacquard over which he layered delicate black Chantilly lace. A quick scan of the top e-commerce sites suggests DellAcquas Rochas is a popular label, but the buys tend to be significantly more conservative than what he showed on the runway today. Among the things that made it to the catwalk that were sure to see online are the eccentric but easy-on-the-feet lace skimmers.$$Sometimes I feel like its futuristic to go into the past. Sometimes fashion quotes like that one, from Kate Mulleavy, seem to make little sensebut what she was talking about after the beautifully feminine Rodarte show was the powerful effect of taking time to read poetry, and then seeing how it works on your creativity. She and her sister, Laura, spent the summer immersing themselves in Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Emily Dickinson, and Leonard Cohen, while listening to Electric Light Orchestras early synthesized, sparkly music. It seems to have put them into a kind of a 70s-nostalgic trance from which their best collection in a long time proceededa kind of soft glam-rock tenderly sewn into immensely intricate lace dresses, trailing long silk scarves and an aura of Old Hollywood glitter in its wake. Whatever therapy reading poetry offers the soul, it seems to have refocused the Mulleavys on what they do best and believe in most, giving them the heart to fully concentrate on the art of dressmaking, which has always been at their fingertips, but has, at times, drifted from their grasp in the crosscurrents of other pop-cultural seasonal notions. This time, though, their promise was realized in a head-spinningly light and complex series of collages of lace, velvet, embroidery, beading, and silk fringing, cut into Victoriana bodices and swinging gently out from small waists to touch the knee. Such lavish techniques can easily lead to heaviness or a sense of inauthentic costumey-ness, but this was a fully realized and believable fashion look. Down to the black lacy tights, down to the truly enviable gold, silver, and colored suede Deco shoes, it read as a young womans interpretation of what it might take to have a really good night out on the town: non-uptight dressing for maybe dancing and lounging languidly around on couches who knows where. It wasnt all dresses, either. What with the floppily louche lam pantsuits, big shearling chubbies, and some sexy, bugle-beaded miniskirts with flower appliqus curving dangerously upward in the front, this was a collection that achieved the range that has also eluded the Mulleavys till now. Did it move fashion on? Probably not. But as far as Rodarte is concerned, looking to its own past brought out what will stick in memory as one of the most soulfully authentic collections in New York.$$Since moving to New York City from Sweden, Carin Rodebjer has, like many of her fellow city-dwellers, developed an obsession with space. Not outer spacethat was the theme of Rodebjers fine Fall 2015 collectionbut space in general, and having enough of it to move around in. This season she translated the obsession into clothes that emphasized movement. The theme was iterated in various waysdiaphanous silk dresses, kimono-shaped jackets and blouses, culottes made for a long stride. Eyelash fringe underscored the collections sense of motion, as well as adding to its rich sense of texture; so did fabrics like a white silk dappled in silver meant to catch and throw back the light.  Silhouettes erred toward the long and the lean, but never so much that the looks came off as in any way constrictive, and the languid tone was echoed in the palette, which moved through rustic earth tones to oceanic blues. There was an element of pop, however: The monochromatic collage prints in sandwashed silk were designed by Rodebjers longtime friend, the artist Liselotte Watkins. The prints geometries, though soft, helped to provide the clothes with a sense of urbanity, one characteristic of Rodebjers oeuvre. For all its vacation-y ease, this was a city-dwellers collection, after all.$$Geometric sculptures dotted the runway like jigsaw puzzles at Roksanda Ilincics show this morning, giving clues to her new collection. Cutouts and asymmetry have been recurring themes on the runways this season, and the designer was thinking along those lines for Spring, too. The show opened with one of her signature floor-length A-line dresses, which was covered with an Abstract Expressionistinspired pattern; but first signs of a more off-center approach came through in a ruffle that snaked along the leg of cropped trousers. That idea reappeared in more recognizable puzzle-like pieces, such as in a sweeping canary yellow and black dress that was cut with keyhole peepholes. Those somewhat tricky experiments in proportion made way for a more fluid silhouette, and the simpler slip dresses in shades of blush, baby blue, yellow, and black were the most convincing looks hereand right in line with the softer, romantic mood of the season. With her mille-feuille shredded chiffon dresses that closed the show, Ilincic took her voluminous aesthetic in an interesting new direction. It would likely require a statuesque beauty like Ilincic herself, though, to pull them off on the red carpet.$$Roland Mourets Galaxy dress turns 10 this year. There have been times during the last decade when Mouret has worked hard to distance himself from that sublime frock, even as the media has never let him forget about it. Today he made a celebration of it, sending the models out for their finale in a rainbow coalition of Galaxy dresses to the delight of the crowd. Designers feel untold pressure to innovateMouret includedand in the endless quest for something new, hes occasionally made dresses too complicated for their own good, with origami-like nipping and tucking at the waistline. The patternmaking has been fairly virtuosic and the hourglass fit sexy, yet the finished product has at times felt overwrought. Mouret avoided that mistake here, opting to explore color and print rather than fabric manipulation, and fixating on the shoulders as a new erogenous zone. In keeping with one of the major trends of the season, there were a handful of cold shoulder dresses, but he made a point of variety, also showing a crisscrossing spaghetti-strap cocktail dress, a fluttery black halter top that descended into a midi-length white skirt, and one-shoulder knits worn with knee-length skirts for a daytime appeal. As for that color and pattern, Mouret took an inclusive approach, offering classic navy on the one hand and bright saffron and mint-green on the other. The most innovative print was actually a laser-cut floral motif on a pair of skirts. The program notes announced a capsule collection of pieces made in the Galaxy dresss image. Theyre already available for sale on the Roland Mouret website. We have a feeling theyll be getting lots of clicks tomorrow.$$Rosetta Getty stumbled onto her inspiration this season. She was at the Getty Center, checking out the Jackson Pollocks, and happened to notice museum workers installing the show Yvonne Rainer: Dances and Films. That got her thinking about postmodern danceits expansiveness and its naked expressivenessand about the aesthetics of the dance world in general. Getty extrapolated the dance theme pretty directly here, and to very appealing effect. She emphasized fluid silhouettes that could accommodate movement, whether in calf-length skirts and dresses with trumpet silhouettes, or fine rib tees with a leotard-like fit, or trousers with a pajama sense of ease. There were also lots of openings and slits, often created via apron-ish ties. Wrapping and tying were already idiomatic to Getty, but she nicely updated her vocabulary this season: The apron-style tunics, open at the side, and white satin wrap dress piped in black were two particularly strong looks. As usual, much of the beauty of Gettys collection was to be found in her fabrics. For example, the crepe she used is, you have to believe, the very best crepe. The excellence of its hand-feel cant really be imparted in words or photos, but a glance at Gettys taupe V-neck gown hints at its terrific drape. Likewise, the cotton poplin she used in her charming flounced off-the-shoulder tops was paradigmatically light and crispy, and the georgette of a black cape-sleeved gown was Platonically silky. One of Gettys grace notes was her tonal, textural adaption, in luxe white viscose, of the paisley print seen elsewhere in silk. Her trousers and wrapped tunic top in the viscose fused pliancy and authority in much the way a top-notch dancer does. Getty did her stumbled-on inspiration proud.$$Rosie Assoulin is having a good time. The bonhomie is self-evident in her clothes, which often come off as immaculately crafted surrealist jokes. Assoulin isnt as sly or pointed as Elsa Schiaparelli was, at least not yet, but shes working in the same playful vein. This season, for instance, she traded in the dirigible-size gowns for which shes been known, and focused instead on recontextualizing the most casual of wear, to wit, bathing suits, pajamas, and underwear. The undies were boxers poking out of slouchy twill pants theyd been sewn into; the pajama-inspired looks came bedazzled in grids of tiny Swarovski crystals or, more slinky yet, were executed in iridescent crystal mesh. Swimsuits, meanwhile, offered Assoulin numerous opportunities to have funtriangle tops as daywear! candy-color bikini bottom ties as embellishment on a cocktail dress! magnified ties cinching the sides of pants!and she parried those riffs with mariner-inspired looks. Workingman and vacationing lady meet at the waters edge: A romantic comedy, by Rosie Assoulin. As far as the evening looks went, Assoulin didnt entirely jettison her penchant for volume and exaggeration this season, but she did rein it way, way in. There were gowns and long skirts that spread out from the hip in godet pleats, and formal tops with Mannerist sleeves. But the designer seemed more turned on by the subtler elements here, like the snaps that allowed a one-shoulder pink frock to shape-shift, if the wearer so desired, or those bedazzled crystal grids. Assoulin is finding new outlets for her sensibility, in other words, and relying less on operatic effects. Surely Schiap would approve.$$Ryan Lo expressed his yen for maximalist cutesiness through a series of treacly-sweet tropes of Valentines schtick, anime superheroes, and fairy-tale archetypes in this tasty sugar rush of a collection. The frills kept coming, frolicking up jersey socks, trousers, and dresses, cavorting hither and thither in crema whorls against printed jersey. Heaped-on jewelry and lost-in-the-forest mussed-up hair added entirely unnecessary but hey-why-not drama and flash.  Acid pick-and-mix intarsia knits with punctuations of knot were the looser, sometimes anguish-touched exhalations. There were heaps of craft, passion aplenty, and reams of reference that Los note writer, Susie Lau, reported featured sweet Kiki from Hayao Miyazakis Kikis Delivery Service and the kawaii witches from Ryans childhood faves Sugar Sugar Rune and Magical DoReMi. Harajuku heaven.$$Some designers drift from season to season looking for a current mood or muse to propel their vision onward. Others, like Ryan Roche, find that the best way to move their label forward comes by returning to a consistent, highly personal aesthetic. In Roches case, that means a veritable obsession with softness, a delicate palette (with a particular fondness for the palest shade of blush), and what can only be called coziness. Thats not to say that her clothes arent forward-thinking: With her latest collection she continued to marry a finely wrought fashion sensibility with a real commitment to ease. As far as starting points, the look of nineties minimalism and ballerinas in rehearsal was percolating in Roches minds eye for Spring. The overall effect was more languid than you would expect from a dancers working uniform though, and a cream robe and slightly oversize ribbed pink sweater would make for luxurious pieces to roll around in on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  These days that casual yet luxurious approach to everyday dressing appeals beyond the weekend, and Roches laid-back elegance speaks to the way many women want to dress right now. That her popular cashmere sweaters came with subtle modern twistsan asymmetric ruffle here, a belted waist therewas all the more reason to fall for them (or more specifically, wrap up in them). Its been a year since Roche was named a runner-up in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition, and its clear from her latest collection that shes headed in the right direction.$$Sacais Chitose Abe landed a Nike collaboration earlier this year, and her name has come up as a possible candidate for the open creative director job at Balenciaga. Wed put her clothes in the top handful of most visible brands on the street style scene, and shes become highly influential for other designers. So, whats the problem? Easy: Abes level of popularity breeds familiarity, and as tempting as it may be to stick with what sells, shes also aware that she must move on to maintain the level of enthusiasm and support shes lately enjoyed.  Her niche has been the concept of hybrids. Abe will combine a sweater and a button-down shirt, a tweed blazer with a biker jacket, or a kilt with a flowing chiffon skirt. For Spring, the idea was to push things further. Its not only about hybrids, but about distortion to get new shape, her right-hand man, Daisuke Gemma, said afterward. We worked very hard. That much was clear. The foundations were familiarvintage shop souvenir scarves, bandanas, Peruvian blanketsbut where they ended up was somewhere way, way beyond basic. These were audaciously complex clothes, constructed from many layers and with a sense of disarraystraps spilling suggestively off shoulders, slashed waistbands falling slack at the hipsintentionally built in.  It was chaotic, just like Paradise Garage was back in the day. (The New York City 80s clubs logo tees appeared here, as they did in her mens collection back in June.) But it was controlled chaos. Abe belongs to an elite group of the most ingenious designers working today. The navy and gold floral pieces (not lace, she pointed out backstage, but embroideries with the negative space laser-cut away) are about to become as ubiquitous as all of the Sacai pieces outside the shows today.$$It used to be you could get away with buying one good dress for an entire social season. But with the advent of social media, notable outfits are made to be documented and sharedmaking the economics of re-wearing garments slightly more problematic for the Instagram set. Babi Ahluwalia, who along with her husband, Sachin, founded Sachin & Babi, said this year she visited several trade shows and spoke directly to a number of customers who expressed anxiety over re-wearing evening gowns after posting images of their outfit on social media. At the same time, they told the designer, they couldnt justify spending thousands of dollars on a dress theyd wear only once. Respecting this new digital landscape, the Ahluwalias paid extra attention this season to evening separates that can be mixed and matched. Strapless trapeze tops in frothy white eyelet or printed chiffon could be worn with a matching skirt or with pants to create an entirely new look (and entice a few double taps, no doubt). The designers were also mindful of the price tag: Everything in the collection is under $1,000, except a hand-embroidered layer cake of a dress that hovers around $1,200 and had enough technical detail to warrant the added cost. Those were the most exciting offerings from the brand. Less so were the more straightforward cocktail dresses, though the couple still found a way to add interest by way of off-the-shoulder necklines and bold, abstract floral prints.$$Commercially, Hedi Slimane has no more to prove with what hes set out to do at Saint Laurent. In a word: selling. His thorough refurb, from advertising to video, to music connections to multiple lines of product, has turned Saint Laurent into a power brand. More than that, the success of his breaking down the house and rendering it into accessible, uncomplicated items has set off a chain reaction at the top of the designer fashion industry. Heads have been rolling and new ones put in place all over Milan, New York, and Paris as corporations scramble to cast talents they pray will be able to replicate Slimanes magic touch with multiproduct marketing. With Alessandro Micheles appointment at Gucci, the process has been working at speed, but in some other places there are bandwagons still stuck in the garage.  Not everyone can package up a look and whack it to the public in such a first-degree, widely understandable, and Zeitgeist-savvy way as Slimane. For Spring, one glance at the lowbrow tiaras, the sparkly see-through mini-mesh dresses, the rock-chick leather jackets, and the skinny legs of the models shoved into Wellington boots told us where he was going. To Glastonbury with Courtney and Kate it was, with an entourage of throwback shaggy-headed waifs and a caravan-load of ready-made vintage-y stuff.  Slimane was smart to suggest he was pitching it in a more down-to-earth way this season. There is a movement toward real, ordinary clothes going on, largely triggered by the left-of-field rise of the Vetements collective, which ingeniously repurposes generic garments. Slimane seemed to have tuned into that when he came up with a perfectly ordinary beige trenchcoat, sand-color camisole, jeans and black Wellingtons, a faded army-surplus shirt, patchworked denim capes, and leather bomber jackets that looked as if they could have been trawled from racks at the cheap end of Portobello Market. Say what you like about whether this is actually design, there is a skill in making a familiar-looking garment fit well and come off as generic enough to be absorbed into a girls wardrobe, and Saint Laurents sales have shot up because of it.  Still, the grunge and glitter theme also gave Slimane the key to turning out his more special things, too: loads of variations on the bias-cut slip dress in metallic sequins or velvet patchwork, liquid gold charmeuse or black silk, plus glam fur and feather chubbies. Finally, though, there is only one litmus test which will make this, or any collection, sell: Is the girl on the runway someone other girls want to be? Slimanes good at pushing classic youth-cultural buttons, but in his casting the one thing hes not in touch with is the fact that todays young girls want to look at other girls who represent the way they look. How long will it take for designers to realize how badly theyre cutting their own chances by not reflecting that?$$Sally LaPointe is best known for her super-luxe knitsthink simple pullovers with fox-fur sleeves and plush cashmere-wool turtlenecks with just enough slouch. Cozy textures are her thing, but since its easier to experiment with pony hair, leather, and merino during the Fall season, Spring always presents a challenge for the designer. This time, LaPointe translated her rich vision by juxtaposing lightweight textures that could still be layered in balmy weather. I was really inspired by the idea of introverts and extroverts, she said backstage. I dont think you can pin anyone down and define them. Everyone is kind of both, so I wanted to present something with a lot of contrasts. A glossy pony robe coat was spliced with pleated (and surprisingly pliable) vinyl, and a chunky, sleeveless sweater was thrown over a swishy sequin skirt. It would make a chic party lookyou could even wear flats!  LaPointe acknowledged that this was a new direction for the brand. But her customers, many of whom shop at Bergdorf Goodman, her biggest retailer, come back to her because they want luxurious, wearable pieces that feel a bit unexpectedand that's just what they'll find here.$$Saloni Lodha launched her brand on the strength of its signature printed dresses. That focus has always served her well, but this time around the designer finally feels shes in a place to branch out. This is the biggest collection weve ever done, said Lodha, who added denim, leather, and T-shirt categories to her lineup this season. I didnt want to expand too soon. Now we are at a stage with our retailers where they really can see us as a full brand. Brand extensions can go either way, of course. But here, the new categories were a major boon: Lodha successfully translated the lines signature playful femininity into those aforementioned leather and denim jackets, jeans, and T-shirts by way of clever embellishments. A favorite included a 70s-inspired cropped denim jacket with a random spattering of grommets in primary colors that is sure to be street style photography bait next season, while a leather jacket embroidered with flowers was an unexpected alternative for evening. Often the new categories furthered themes that have been central to Lodhas aesthetic from the beginning: A pair of organic natural-dye jeans, in which you can see stripes of variation in the springy pink hue, were made in Pondicherry, India, the same area that Lodha named her LLC for when she first launched her business. But the core of the brand will always be printed dresses; theyre a buyers no-brainer and a consistent best-seller. For Spring, the designer tweaked some of the offerings to go even more romantic, with skin-baring cutouts and prints painted on lace. All in all, this collection was a strong step forward for Saloni.$$Flavia Pennetta, the Italian winner of this years US Open, received a round of applause from the audience as the lights went down at Salvatore Ferragamo. Her surprise victory didnt impact creative director Massimiliano Giornettis latest offering, which was underway months ago; nonetheless there was a certain synergy in the matchup. Giornettis latest collection had a buoyant grace. Though it's not activewear by any stretch of the imagination, a woman could be active in these dresses and look great.  Leather is almost obligatory chez Ferragamo, even for Spring. Giornetti did a fine job of making it suitable for warm weather, cutting it in generous proportions and using bar-tacked seams that quite literally let a paperbag-waist skirt and loose-fitting culottes breathe. But despite the houses shoemaking legacy, the best pieces here werent skins. Rather, they were the midi-length sundresses in lofty cotton: one in black with bows on the shoulder straps; a strapless style with a wrapped waist in sky blue; and another strapless frock that combined tiers or black, dusty pink, and coral. Knit dresses had a springy bounce, too. By comparison, chiffon numbers with feather embellishments looked fussy, and there were a few too many extraneous bows on other pieces. Still, all in all, this was a good-looking outing for Giornetti.$$On a recent phone call, Samu-Jussi Koski reported that the consensus from friends and family was that his clothes had done some growing up since last spring. Its an unexpected comment, perhaps, given the certain ageless appeal that has always characterized the Samuji brand. But there was a new serenity to this seasons looks, owing in part to the scaled-back quirk factor. Gone were the high-shine silver metallics, the crafty mermaid print, and the kicky colors. In their place, the designer delivered a concise lineup of spare, tranquil pieces inspired by the glamour of mid-century film stars holidaying in the south of Italy; the results were far from retro. A palette that took its cues from the delicate shades of gelatopistachio, melon, peachlent a subtle sweetness, tempered by modern-feeling shapes (terrific cropped flares) and fabrications (a glossy, leather-like black resin-coated cupro). Knits remain a strong category for the label, like a sheer, sea-foam-color mock neck, ideal for layering, or svelte ribbed styles to team with an A-line mini. Another strong suit of Koskis? Outerwear, especially two styles in washi paper, a fabrication thats far more environmentally friendly than, say, viscose; thats a choice that is both grown-up and great-looking.$$Sea designers Sean Monahan and Monica Paolini have long been associated with a breezy, hippieish spirit, but theyve started to sense that others are encroaching on their territory. Were trying to move away from boho a bit, Monahan said, surrounded by at least seven racks in the duos airy Canal Street loft (a fifth-floor escape amid the chaos of New York Fashion Week). Seas signatureslace, eyelet, embroidery, and looser silhouettescertainly fit the boho stereotype, and they also happen to be trending heavily elsewhere. And while Sea consistently feels easy and effortless, some other designers iterations of the boho trend seem overwrought. So for Spring, Monahan and Paolini opted for sleeker shapes, such as culottes, quilted jackets, and boxy blouses, and nixed their usual hand-distressing. It added up to clothes that were as arty and youthful as ever, but just a touch more refined, which will only help them at their biggest stockist, Barneys New York. For example, instead of holey jeans, they washed their ice-blue denim over and over so it emerged as soft as cashmere. It was particularly covetable on a slit-front midi skirt with a braided belt. The designers also played with heavier, more geometric lace patterns, which felt refreshingly non-flimsy, and in lieu of complicated embroideries, they employed the beauty of natural textures like rumpled linen and crisp cotton.  Without question, daywear is Seas specialty, but there were some surprisingly chic day-to-night propositions, too, like a deep-V indigo jumpsuit and an apron-front gingham dress. Both would look equally lovely with white sneakers or glittery stilettos, but it would be interesting to see what Monahan and Paolini might do with a tux or silk party dress.$$Where does the See By Chlo girl go when the winds of travel blow her stateside? Cali, of course! This season Clare Waight Keller imagined her muse roadtripping from San Francisco to Big Sur, bringing with her clothes that reflected the houses Anglo-Franco vibe and all but guaranteed a good time. Here were breezy pieces in a sunbleached palette that spoke to days spent driving around with the top down: cream, soft peach, washed-out blues. Denim came in two distinct formscrisp indigo and a supple, lighter shade that felt akin to something you had worn and loved for years. That was just one of many parallels with the looks that went down the main line runway last Spring: frothy broderie anglaise, here trimming blouses; dreamy bohemian gowns; head-to-toe total look dressing. SBC even debuted another take on Waight Kellers jean maxi skirt, this one slung low on the hips and with a frayed hem. Elsewhere a geometric archival Chlo print from the seventies found new life in a knit dress and sweater. There was plenty of lovely, youthful sprezzatura to be had here, and even if Chlos more senior customer might take a pass on the graphic sweatshirts, you got the sense that she wouldn't hesitate to snap up other styles for some adventuring of her own.$$When Sharon Wauchob said, Sometimes you dont want to change anything, and then there are times when youre hungry for something new, she made a key admission of a feeling likely shared by other designers. For this collection, Wauchob was operating in the latter headspace without betraying the former. One wouldnt normally associate her restrained and refined approach with the word unhinged, yet thats how she framed this go-round, pointing out how, as a woman designer, the end goal isnt necessarily shock value so much as defying expectations. Wauchob did that by using techniques that imbued her clothes with a spectrum of strong personalities. Whereas the crushed pleated silk jumpsuit registered as romantically restless, bouncing with each stride, a lace slip dress festooned with tufts of cardinal red silk fringe signaled something wilder. The collection tempted from all directions, in no case more than a skirt fronted with leather and backed with lace. Even the unlined suede coats, encircled with low-slung belts featuring an irregular brass medallion, hinted at that same alluring ease. If all that matters to a potential client is the degree of sheerness, then that person is missing the point (or should stick to the ingenious cross-body bag, dangling from a single eyelet). Suffice it to say, the level of savoir faire surpassed layman explanations; and with so many permutations of such provocative workmanship, the fabrication details barely mattered. With Wauchob, its easy to default to calling her collections delicate; but consider the slouched trousers, sneakers, and new sculptural jewelry by Chris Boland, and the descriptor becomes imprecise at best. Despite all the vintage and vaguely Asian influences, this lineup captured Wauchobs desire to bridge past and future. The desire has probably always been there; its just taken her until now to let go of being understated.$$Its really remarkable that Siblings Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery managed not only to put on a show this afternoon, so soon after the death of their partner in style, Joe Bates, but to stage one filled with such joie de vivre. The collection was dedicated to Bates, whose presence was much felt by his absence, but it was also a tribute to 60s starlets such as Monica Vitti and Brigitte Bardot, and imagined them bumming around the Riviera in various iterations of leopard print. The 60s reference wasnt particularly literal: Bryan and McCreery gave it a strong disco gloss, with lots of sparkling knits, and their way of riffing on the eras fascination with man-made fabrications was to create skirts, dresses, and coats in whipstitched sculpted plastic. Those items were highly editorial, as were the cape and gown in a ball-bedecked crochet. Other looks were more street-ready. The glittery knit slip dresses and cardigans were accessible and appealing, while items in leopard-print denim could happily find a home in many a sassy girls wardrobe. A short-sleeved swing coat in the denim seemed well suited to a contemporary would-be Bardot. The highlights of the show, however, were two other, similarly shaped pieces of outerwear: The frilled plastic and gold-tipped knit coats had the madcap quality one seeks in a Sibling collection and showcased the labels signature innovative knit work, but they came off as viably wearable rather than camp or experimental or absurd. No doubt Bates would have been proud.$$Jake Sargent and Daniel Corrigans Spring outing for Simon Miller combined their perennial Japanese influences with an American Southwest attitude. Here was a collection that was sparse in spirit but had a great richness to it thanks to the fabrications the designers opted for. Their biggest aesthetic splurges came where color was concerned: Pops of burnt red and chartreuse felt right in step with more sun-bleached neutrals and tawny nubuck. Also new this season: A strong move into bags at opposite ends of the size spectrum, from the itty-bitty Bonsai with ring handleswhich was right in step with street styles current yen for tiny shapesto a big bucket bag to carry all your worldly possessions and sling over your shoulder. Knitwear was especially appealing. Chalk that up to the Japanese silk tops and skirts, which projected a kind of cool, mid-century austerity. As far as denim was concerned, the duo made a bet on their great wide leg as a hero silhouette, offering it in a buttery suede that will be tough to beat in terms of simple, laid-back luxury for spring. In addition to the bags, the pair is finding other ways of emphasizing Simon Miller as a lifestyle brand. They have launched an eyewear collaboration with New York optical legend Sol Moscot and teamed up for an offbeat sandal capsule collection with the cultlike Japanese footwear label Jojo. Simon Miller may not be a new kid on the block but, in Sargent and Corrigans expert hands, it continues its confident march toward becoming a household name.$$Its a wonderful thing when a young designer truly comes into her own, at a point when expectations and respect have already been running high, but then she simply exceeds all that. Simone Rocha sent that feeling through her audience today withwhen it comes down to itthe amazing things she did with pink dresses. That sounds narrow, if not sugary, but from the two semitransparent opening looks she showedpuff-sleeved, full-skirted, and boldly bisected with black macram strapsshed already riveted the attention of everyone who had come to see her show in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London. It takes some daring for a young designer to hire a former royal palace, heaving with gilding and British establishment history, but there she was, amongst the grandeur it all, showing an entrancing collection which succeeded in elevating her talent for prettiness, sexuality, tenderness, and quirky techniques to a new level. Where did that come from? I found out I was pregnant while I was in Japan, working on a project with Dover Street Market Ginza, and then went on to Kyoto for a few days, said Rocha. I was suddenly seeing everything so intensely, it felt trippy! It wasnt a collection which overtly stated Japanese influenceswhich of course can be hackneyedso much as it insinuated and abstracted them. Part of it was down to Rochas adulation of the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki, to whose bar she made a pilgrimage in Tokyo. Arakis body of work involves specialist bondage practices peculiar to Japan. Thats what triggered Rocha to start thinking about knots and braids, and begin developing cross-body straps, whole bodices in clear plastic, and finishing dresses with silken strands running across bare backs.  Rarely have the notions of prettiness and perversity from a young womans point of view come together so potently. This was also a collection which absolved Rocha of any former accusations of heaviness and repetition. Her airy, bouncy organza skirts put paid homage to that, just as the new, chic bubble-sleeved narrow dresses, the series of spongy tailoring decorated with kimono-cum-couture bows, and the green bamboo-forest prints proved something else: Rocha has range. It was a personal breakthrough.$$The girl who wears Sonia by Sonia Rykiel may be updating her wardrobe every seasona coat with trompe l'oeil detailing here, a leather striped miniskirt therebut shes consistently the same playful gal at heart. For Spring, there happened to be a lot of hearts: embroidered together as broderie anglaise, swirled into a bandana paisley, frilled and tacked onto the shoulders of a tee, studded to the back of a heel (the liveliest of all appeared mid-wink, as if making eye contact with its Comme des Garons pals). There were other motifs, too, including warmly hued rainbows, simplified flowers, and a particularly sassy pair of lips that could be zipped open and shut from the chest of a sweater.  If the collection sounds like it put too much emphasis on throwback prints, the overall effect didnt exhaust the eyes. This was largely owing to additional themes that expanded upon reliable Rykiel signatures. A denim story, for instance, did not always consist of jeans; indigo tweed cleverly conveyed as much versatility, while dark blue satin dressed down a sequined shift. For all the integrated embellishments, accessories factored stronglyand surrealisticallyin giving the looks an updated twist. See also: the sparkly socks paired with high-heeled sandals. And when a Lurex dress, specially knit to appear striped, was referred to as ideal date-night attire, the sweet side of Sonia by Sonia suddenly turned coquettish. Except that this Rive Gauche girl of the street (the photos, taken once again by Sonia Sieff, show Langley Fox posing in the middle of the road) is far more likely to wear her heart on her sleeve than make an outright shameless gesture.$$We were back at Sonia Rykiels famous Left Bank shop for Julie de Librans Spring show today. The recently installed bookshelves were covered with black velvet curtains and the runway glittered like wet pavement. Waiters passed around electric blue cocktails and Londons C.A.R. provided the soundtrack, setting the stage for a collection pitched mostly toward evening. Saint-Germain-des-Prs, in addition to its famous brasseries and cafs, also has a thriving club culture, according to the program notes. In De Librans first two runway shows for the French brand, the offerings were broader, but this one began and ended with sequins.  In between, the designer touched on the famous Rykiel sweaters, turning out baseball-style tees in a thick crochet that looked handmade and slinky pliss knit dressesbut sadly there were no stripes, the house signature. Note to designers at heritage brands: Dont ignore the heritage. The shows loose theme was les oiseaux de nuitnight owlso there were bird motifs on everything from a poplin camp shirt to silk pajama sets, and more than a few marabou feather stoles. Cotton dresses in a swallow print that looked a lot like camo were the shows best pieces: danceable, yet also easy to wear during the day. We wouldnt have minded seeing more of that kind of thing. But before or after dark, easy-to-wear was an imperative for De Libran. The holographic sequin dresses that closed the show were knitted, not embroidered, and the back sides were fine-gauge sweaters, meaning they were as light as can be and as comfortable as a T-shirt, but glam nonetheless.$$The Sophie Theallet show this evening kicked off with a bang. A literal one: Audience members snapped to attention as a drummer pounded out a loud beat from the far reaches of Theallets outdoor show space. The attention was called for, as this latest collection from the designer was one for which you wanted to be wide awake. This was a joyful fashion show. The music, supplied by a troupe of Senegalese drummers, was thoroughly happy-making, and so were the clothes, the best that Theallet has ever produced. Africa was the key reference here, unabashedly so. It was a dream of Africa, as Theallet put it, that she extrapolated via textures of raffia and burlap, cape silhouettes, and extraordinary, couture-quality lace that read a bit like snakeskin. There were also beautiful smudged black-and-white prints that riffed on tribal body paint, and halter necklines redolent of traditional African chokers. Theallet was appropriating, but with such a fluency and generosity of spirit, and with such good instincts about how to integrate her African inspiration into prototypically Western silhouettes, that the appropriation felt earned. The Theallet womanand she was a woman, not a girlhadnt just gone to Africa and returned with some fresh ideas about aesthetics. Shed come back with a whole new point of view. There were too many standout looks here to list them all. Theallet made magic with her lace, using it with subtlety as a cobwebby layer of black on top of a caramel-colored cape, and to much more graphic effect in gridded dresses and skirts. She also wowed the crowd with two sexy striped lace jumpsuits that were shown on genuinely full-figured girls. (This Theallet show was a model for diverse casting in general, by the way.) Theallet updated her signature hourglass silhouette with panache, using broad raffia belts to set off her full shorts and mid-calf skirts. The halter-neck dresses and gowns featuring tiers of feathers and raffia strips belong on a red carpet, posthaste. And the daywear spanned from breezily feminine, with ruffled silk dresses in a small smudged dot print, to burlap linen tailoring that was almost utilitarian, it was so matter-of-fact. Theallet finally found her niche as a tailor with this collectionthese looks were nearly as confident as the diaphanous sheer numbers that found her revisiting the brand vocabulary thats been native to her from the start. It was fitting that this show concluded with a burst of drumming and dancing: Theallet was due a celebration.$$Clinically minimal with a twist of 60s redux (deluxe), this maritime-seasoned Sportmax collection should cruise serenely from runway to store rack to wardrobe. A toughened-up pinafore shirthemmed dress in heavy white cotton featured the round black pockets that were the ongoing contradiction to pure restraint here. They also came on wide sailor pants, a lightweight parka, and a high-waisted jacket used as a topsail over a white silk blouse. There was so much finely draped fabric a-swoosh at the base of another pinafore that sailed forth full-length and zingily orange, that it was hard to make out if it qualified strictly as a dress (possible) or jumpsuit (probably). Assuredly the latter was a deep-V-neck, kicky-legged muster of irregular monochrome stripes against navy and more orange. A pair of tangerine-size eyelets just above the navel on a white shirtdress and a blue front-zip culottes-suit allowed for some hearty, here-to-there belt knotting. The chain print that clanked to the foreground neatly mirrored the chrome buckles on collars and accompanying bucket bags. Cast next was a net print on silk jumpsuits, sweaters, and skirts, before the introduction of grids of round lace as a curtain-closing motif. The lack of a Breton stripe showed admirable restraint in what was a Cardin-tinged assembly of sea-flecked 21st-century staples: placid and pleasing.$$As in seasons past, Stella Jeans show was a vibrant cultural nook. Despite its bold colors and zingy patterns, this was no straightforward travel story. Migration was the topic the Italo-Haitian designer highlighted Wednesday through her Spring offering, which she showcased, refreshingly, on a multi-racial model cast. In the face of the largest movement of refugees on the Continent since World War II, and with Italy becoming one of the main landing points, it was a bold move to launch a windblown Milan Fashion Week with a statement, and in a new and apt venuethe citys recently opened cultural center Museo delle Culture (Museum of Cultures), or Mudec. Departure was the starting point, and the designers printed T-shirts emblazoned with imagery from Once Upon a Time in Americathe Sergio Leone filmwas a pithy reference to Italys historical flux. From there, sweeping in scope, the saturated colors, rich textures, and intricate detailing of the opening looks drew references from South American climes. Voluminous, printed, flounced, and maxi skirts recalled traditional Salvadoran dressSalvador is commonly called Bahiaand the spot where immigrants historically entered Brazil. Pom-poms, tassels, and beads embellished many of Jeans playful accessories, like great raffia bejeweled slides and handbags. Roomy Andean-striped coats and jackets as well as cactus and parrot prints were a contemporary take on the regions ornate style. Overlapping continents, Jeans signature Wax & Stripes designsmade of vibrant patterns worn across West Africaappeared as ruffle-sleeved tunics and skirts and prim appropriations of silk pussy-bow blouses. From there the collection shifted to England. Highlighting the current exponential growth of Italian immigration to the U.K., Savile Row tailoring was the designers inspiration, and trenchcoats and natty shirting the material result. Embracing what her label is known forusing African prints on European formsJeans barefooted finale consisted of very commercial beachwear with a retro 50s aira breezy way to end her powerful, far-flung adventure.$$The key to summertime dressing is effortlessness. Its a principle that Stella McCartney applies to all of her collections, and it was in full effect at her upbeat show this morning, where she put a major emphasis on knits. Knitwear has become more visible on Spring runways over the last couple of fashion cycles as innovative, computer-enabled techniques have allowed designers to do things not possible before. Theres another reason sweater dressing is on the rise, and it comes down to the comfort factor. McCartneys layered tanks, polo shirts, and tube skirts looked stretchy as activewear, sporty and poised for action on the athletic sandals they paraded out on, but elevated in bright stripes, checks, and transparencies. She also played with vibrant, pleated knits in loose trapeze-like shapes with sexy cutaways. Its been a great week for color in Paris, but McCartneys as bold as anybody, combining vivid orange and blue or chili red with pink on those knit separates. Swirls of ribbon embroidery made a similarly strong impact on tracksuits and dresses. Her other project here was rethinking the suit, which has been an icon of the brand from the beginning. She did that via deconstruction; a double-breasted black jacket was transformed into a strapless, form-fitting tunic worn over a multi-slit skirt. And she did it by using unexpected materials, as was the case with an off-the-shoulder jacket and slouchy pants cut from raw indigo denim with high-contrast white stitching. More conventional pieces like vests and trousers had an appealing fluidity and elongated proportions.  Slip dresses were another key component of her first collection postSaint Martins nigh on 20 years ago. Theres never been a bigger moment for boudoir dressing than Spring 2016, but McCartney more or less avoided the subject. A missed opportunity? Not really. In acid hues, her swirling eyelet dresses will stand out at stores next spring.$$The first thing Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty wanted to talk about backstage at this mornings Suno show was the shoes. After umpteen seasons collaborating with Nicholas Kirkwood, Suno has launched its own line of Italian-made footwear. Beatty said the goal was to create shoes that looked distinctive, but that were easy to wear: Not too precious, she explained, but also not, you know, too fierce. Not too precious/not too fierce also served as a good summation of the clothes on Sunos runway. Inspired by a visit to the recent exhibition When the Curtain Never Comes Down at the American Folk Art Museum, the designers riffed on the practice of outsider artists who channeled compulsive mental states into their work. Their focus was on the ways that these artists would use geometry to create a sense of orderhence the collections repeating square patterns and numerous looks belted (Beatty used the apt word restricted) at the waist. One of the nice ways that Beatty and Osterweis got at their theme was by introducing little grace notes of off-ness, such as the seemingly random placement of gathers on items like the opening dress in gingham. They also made reference to the origin of their inspiration by using folksy techniques and fabricsthat gingham, for instance, but also eyelet, peasant blousestyle ruching, and denim. A calf-length denim skirt, shown with a matching belted minidress, was the best look in the show.$$Im not your seductress. That was designer Suzanne Raes mantra for Spring, a manifesto for women who dress for themselves, not the gaze of others; in short, her customers. Rae makes quietly arty staples that place an emphasis on construction and fit. Here she struck a balance between concealing and revealing: boxy, unisex shapes like kimonos in Japanese denim, and clingier bias-cut dresses. Trousers and tops in a sheeny cotton nylon were standouts, and gave way to other novel fabrications like a white Italian jacquard splashed all over with burnout blooms. That print felt like a rarebut welcomeextravagance among so many garments that receded, down to their clear buttons. One development for Rae that was anything but retiring? A group of two-tone ribbed knits in juicy, jolie-laide color combos; there was a certain seductiveness to themthe kind that will pit cool girls against their wallets.$$When asked backstage about the through line for his Spring 2016 collection, Tadashi Shoji summed it up in one word: Japan. The designer has been feeling nostalgic of late. Maybe, he suggested, because Im old. For Resort he mined his childhood spent in Japan, and this season he continued the theme with an homage to his native country in the springtime.  Shoji drew from the obvious: The peonies, irises, and cherry blossoms that explode all over the country in spring were clearly the inspiration behind a number of looksperhaps too much so. A frothy pink cupcake of a gown with fluffy floral appliqus, for instance, unmistakably recalled the sakura in bloom. It was far from groundbreaking, to be sure, but for Shojis customer thats not necessarily a problem. The designer seemed to save up all his daring for a handful of sheer gowns with strategically placed floral embroidery to conceal the good bitsnot unlike the headline-making gown Beyonc wore to the Met Gala this year. Everybody is doing sheerRihanna and all those people are doing it, and revealing a lot [on the red carpet], said Shoji backstage. But I dont like that. So, I very nicely hid everything and it still looks beautiful. Shojis clients will no doubt appreciate the modesty.$$By Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhofs estimation, they have done about 800 variations of their ruched stretch dress, whose svelte effect has endeared the brand to legions of political wives, red carpet regulars, and other women with busy social lives back home in Germany and elsewhere. Thanks to that little number, Talbot Runhof has quietly built a small empire and, last spring, the house unveiled a new flagship in a Baroque-style manse in Munich.  Theres always a lot going on at Talbot Runhof. For Spring, the story was very much about a palatial lifestyle. In the same spirit as last seasons homage to Mona Bismarck, a copy of the lavish Marella Agnelli: The Last Swan, picked up at Rizzoli in New York City, became the springboard for exploring what the duo terms sleek maximalism. In other words, they remained true to their love of intricacy but toned down the volume just a tad, sticking to noble fabrics and a neutral palette jazzed up with the occasional splash of blue. The result was a succession of loose, elongated silhouettes in crisp sun-pleated chiffon, satin, and crepe, sometimes paired with an embroidered shell in layered taffeta trimmed with silk tassels, at other times with ecru trousers, and always worn with palazzo slippers in candy-color satin.  Obviously, this woman is not headed to an office anytime soon. But if the clothes were intended to feel like a perpetual vacation, the collection also nodded to the empire that made the Agnelli lifestyle possible. The iconic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy, for example, was the concept behind the modernist Lingotto print that cropped up on a silk top, caftan, and long cotton skirt. Likewise, an Art Decoinflected cogs-and-gears print emerged on a chiffon pantsuit and under a veneer of transparent sequins on an evening gown. Elsewhere, the pair threw it into high gear to express movement, in rows of fringe in guipure lace and laser-cut hologram foil on a sleeveless tweed jacket. The one-off white parka with tufts of fil coupe was a bit of a wild ride, the designers allowed. Wisely, they stopped there. And anyway, it was aperitivo time.$$Tamara Mellon, the cofounder and former CEO of Jimmy Choo, is a businesswoman with a flourishing eponymous line and the empire-touting uniform to match. It makes sense that she has a knack for translating that knuckle-under look into her collections. Her latest was a riff on the I am woman, hear me roar soundtrack of the 70s translated into body-skimming frocks, long and lean jumpsuits, and plenty of look-at-me shine. So what does the wardrobe of the fearless woman who has it all include? There were Amazonian Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman references; a hot pink maxi dress spliced in the midsection with a studded leather eyelet for a sliver of skin; and a thick bodice wrapped around the waist of a light dress for a cinched hourglass look. There was also a dash of Studio 54, with nods to other retro heroines of the night, like a slinky silver Lurex jumpsuit which could have been worn by Bianca Jagger. As for Mellons bold signature punch of animal prints, there was a bare-shoulder leopard-print frock complete with a thigh-skimming slit. Perhaps thinking of the woman on the go, Mellon referenced the optic white jumpsuits she designed for the crew of Blade, a helicopter service that flies passengers to the Hamptons. This time, she made them in dark denim, complete with a thick collar and a front zippera piece which ought to make the wearer feel like shes in the pilots seat.$$Tanya Taylora longtime proponent of color and cheerstood in all white at the end of a rainbow-filled room at the presentation of her Spring 2016 collection. The designer had enlisted the Minneapolis street artist Hot Tea (n Eric Rieger) to dangle thousands of pieces of colored yarn from the ceiling of the Swiss Institute, in Soho, for her show (he is the artist who yarn-bombed the Williamsburg Bridge in 2013, bedecking the pedestrian overpass into a Crayola-hued canopy). It was just the most beautiful thing, said Taylor, I wanted to bring it here.. Color ricocheted throughout the gallery spacethough, really, it would have anyway. Taylors designs reveled in hand-painted floral prints, checks, stripes, oversize knits woven through with braided Swarovski beading, boldly striped sundresses, and subtle safari detailing like that on a plaid seersucker pleated sundress that laced up the bodice. A first foray into denim was as light and feminine as the rest of the showing, boasting a Swiss dot effect across a military-esque anorak and lace laser-cut edges at the hems of cropped trousers. A swingy bell-sleeved frock was garden-party ready with green pleated cuffs and skirt, the sort of thing that one pops on and is immediately coaxed to twirl. Sure, texture was especially important this season for Taylor (who spent part of the summer in Kenya with the Clinton Foundation and came away from her Maasai cultural experience with an increased interest in beading), but the message of the collection was one of pretty, above all else. And you know what? There are far worse things to be for spring.$$Telfar ranks among that rarefied group of mens labels on the utilitarian unisex front, where the question of gender hangs in the air but doesnt actually come into question. In fact, said designer Telfar Clemens before the show, and without a moments hesitation, I kind of started the whole thing. Which is to say, that particular shade of ambiguity is, at this point, beside the point. Its old hat, by now blurred, subverted, transcended. Plus, this is the labels 25th season, making it more of a seasoned grown-up than a scrappy young thing hell-bent on provocation. Born out of a streetwise functionality, Telfar aspires to exactly that. Subliminal branding, the designer asserted, nothing frivolous. Of course frivolity is in the eye of the beholder, and it remains to be seen what the beholder makes of off-the-shoulder tanks, dress shirts with missing sides, and halter tops whose spaghetti straps stretch over a mans articulated shoulders to a comical, cheeky effect. That and a pair of white daisy dukes practically shrink-wrapped over bulging thighs were among the only suggestions of old-school drag. Shoes straddled the fence between ballet flats and standard-issue Vans-style sneakers. As for branding, the name Telfar brazenly scrawled down the front of shirts in a lacy mesh and a TC logo stitched into every other piece werent exactly subliminal, but droll insider references to logomania never go unappreciated.  Clemens also indulged in a fussy obsession with the numbers six and eight, wherein detailsparticularly cargo pocketsappeared no fewer than six or eight times on a given sleeve, belt loop, tag, and so on. Bizarre, to be sure, but it added to the collections curious, enigmatic allure. To say nothing of the backdrop, a trippy animation of the designer as avatar, mixed with allusions to the sponsor, White Castle. Product placement was never like this.$$According to the Temperley London show notes laid out on attendees seats, the theme of Alice Temperleys latest collection was Havana. This was one of those occasions where, after the final dfil, you glanced again at those notes, considered what youd just seen on the runway, and thought, Nah. Its not that Temperley didnt reference Havana, or her private fantasy of Havana, in these clothes; its just that the Cuban motifs ran a distant second in importance to the shows real theme, which was embroidery. The heart of this collection was Temperleys heavily embroidered sundresses, and likewise embellished sundress-esque ensembles. Backed in crisp white or navy cotton, these pieces came in a variety of relaxed silhouettes and played host to a virtual fireworks display of floral and abstract embroidered patterns. Theyll be catnip on the sales floorindeed, women who dont usually gravitate to Temperley may find themselves tempted by the sundress looks. The designer deployed similar styles of embroidery on more formal, tulle-backed dresses and separates, as well. The look of the decorative embroidery was repeated on non-embroidered garments, too. Notably, Temperleys signature intarsia knits echoed the effect, as did some of the pieces in printed silk. The collection as a whole had a winning sense of easeeven the tailored looks shared in its languorous, tropical vacation tone, which was amplified by the romance of Temperleys occasional ruffles and flounces. The one quibble, really, was with the full-on evening looks: The combination of mirror sequins and tassel embroidery came off a touch de trop. Temperley did better with her more casual takes on the category, in particular the silk kimono gown in a tropical bird print. Here, at least, the show notes rang true: The dress was embroidery-free, and the Havana theme came through.$$At her presentation this afternoon, Tess Giberson admitted that her latest collection was really just an extension of the one shed designed for Resort. No complaints thereGibersons Resort collection was a rich yet concise interpretation of her experience visiting Walter Gropius's house in Massachusetts, and given that she had more to say about Gropiuss home, it was nice to find her revisiting the theme. As Giberson put it, her focus this time was on moments within the house, rather than its overarching aesthetic impact. With that in mind, she dilated on details such as the lacing on chairs or the fringes of a pillow, and expanded them into recurring motifs. The fringe came off particularly wellclean and un-hippieishwhile the lacing, used widely, made for some of the sexiest looks Giberson has ever produced, notably the double-slit skirt with a front panel of upholstery-like jacquard. Another winning extrapolation from chez Gropius was the deep blue watercolor striped silk, taken from a duvet, which Giberson made into a fantastic pieced-together slip dress. It looked like just the thing to wear on a hot and humid summer daya day, you might say, a lot like this one. Pieces in bone-white mesh were just as suited to swampy weather, while micro-pleated trousers, detailed with a canny ankle slit, or ribbed knit dresses with architectural cabling about the neckline, had a more trans-seasonal durability. As a whole, this collection continued the roll that Giberson has been onif she needs to continue making pilgrimages to the homes of great architects to keep it going, so be it.$$For his Spring 2016 collection, Thakoon Panichgul filled his front row with It-girl artists (Langley Fox Hemingway, Phoebe Collings-James) and a smattering of actresses who like to align themselves with a certain artistic sensibility (Bella Heathcote, Christina Ricci, Jessica Alba), and really, who better than the very fetching and creatively inclined to celebrate what the designer called a vision of the New Bohemia?  For Thakoon, that New Bohemia will be tie-dyed: From the bleached, lightweight denim to the slim silk slip dresses printed with a grunge grid to the crinkled chiffon, evidence of the hippie-favored coloring technique was everywhere on his runway. And what, the designer proposed, do bohemians love more than tie-dye? Wearing their pajamas, of course. Out came all manner of elegant attire for sleep enthusiasts: seemingly Julian Schnabelinspired chambray robe coats and scoop-hemmed micro-shorts (longer in the center, mimicking the hem of a sleep shirt) in pale shades of robins-egg blue with trim crimson piping or pure white terry cloth, all worn with immediately covetable, comely flat sandals that were halfway between a huarache and a gladiator. As for wearing your pajamas out on the town, when youre busy being creative, who has time for clothes? Well, actresses do, of course, and the most winning takeaways came in the sleekly crisp, bicolored broderie anglaise dressesjust the thing for a Cannes photo call. (Theres plenty of time to divulge your artistic leanings at the press conference straight after.)$$Whats new in Greg Chaits hyper-luxe world of knits? Plenty. The Elder Statesman has amped up its offerings over the past couple of seasons, and for Spring there was a lot to love. For one thing, Chait worked with middle-weight yarn for the first time, turning out strong pieces like a pink cold-shoulder dress, and a gauzy, milk-white jumper. Elsewhere, sweatpants and a hoodie (as you might imagine, a far, decadent cry from the Champion of your adolescence) came printed all over in the softest of gradient rainbows. And what kind of comfort-hating monster could argue with propositions like black-and-white striped pull-on cashmere shorts, or a pastel hand-tie-dyed polo maxi dress in silk cashmere? Most importantly, Chaits clothes dont just feel goodthey look good. Take a woven Kenyan cotton with an irregular hand in a gorgeous mottled cream color, smashing in a pair of button-front trousers, or the plushest Italian cashmere as woven on a traditional backstrap loom in Central America. The latter came whipped into a dreamy top with softly fraying edges and a crocheted neckline, and the effect was as quietly polished as many a piece youd find at the high-end stores where The Elder Statesman is carried. And despite a laid-back brand image, that polish continues to distinguish the label. As Chait himself tells it: Theres a free-spiritedness, but were not hippies. Doubtful? Look no further than this seasons hero graphic tee, which read, simply: Hippies are ruining the world.$$It may not always look like it from the pictures, but the traditional order and format of shows has been thrown up in the air over the past year. At the luxury level, innumerable houses have decided to break the system and show when, where, and how they choose in order to reach the women they most want to engage, which has sent guests off on many a globe-trotting trip in pursuit of the fashion experience. Now The Row has done the same, not showing in its hometown, New York, but shifting to Paris, where, as Mary-Kate Olsen explained, many of our customers are, who we want to support. As you will see, tomorrow we are having a show in a chteau, 45 minutes outside Paris. Now, 45 minutes outside Paris, tantalizing as that sounds, does not fit the schedules of journalists who are doing the rounds of the shows every hour on the hour. So yesterday Mary-Kate and sister Ashley gave them a preview of what a more exclusive crowd will be seeing today. Its interesting to speculate how this collection will go down among a mixed European audience. In one way, The Row comes straight out of the American tradition of simplicity and pure lines, which goes back to the minimalism of the 80s and, even further, to principles of usefulness that have roots in the pioneering spirit. Though the Olsens showed a couple of draped chiffon minidresses and a sheer pleated two-piece here, their natural design instinct is to stay far away from the body and keep any sense of sexual display under wraps (there was, literally, a linen blanket coat) and feet grounded in slides. In a way, they are passive resisters to the idea of trends and fashiontheirs is work that comes under the heading of lifestyle, and a luxuriously serene one, too. Thats the point at which the philosophy is likely to connect most easily with a certain French tradition that also fundamentally rejects nouveau display. The Row isnt Herms, but maybe the Olsens can persuade their Euro audience that they share the same kind of sensibilities.$$Back in the mid-90s, when Lisa Kulson was designing the first pairs of Theory pants, she mightve rolled her eyes at the high-water trousers that are the look of the moment now. We all probably would have. But fashion changes, and in its latest incarnation, Theory is in the business of responding to those shifts. I want women to think of us as a lifestyle brand, Kulson said under a cloudless sunset on the rooftop of the companys Meatpacking District headquarters. Were not the brand that made your first interview suit anymore.  There were culottes and slouchy track pants and walking shorts. Polka dots and stripes featured in the mix. A suede tunic and coat nodded slightly at the 70s. And the off-the-shoulder silhouette thats suddenly everywhere turned up on both a top and a belted dress. But it was a navy pair of those high-water trousersschoolboy pants, is how Kulson described themthat got editors jazzed tonight. Throw in the matching navy blazer with brass buttons, and the whole suit would cost less than the pants alone at the fancy French house that did them first. Smart.$$Its hard to know what to say about a collection like the one Thom Browne showed today. Not because theres nothing to write aboutindeed, theres so, so muchbut because Browne telegraphs his messages so overtly, theres not much room for interpretation. Browne is kind of a control freak, as designers go. You can see that in the fastidiousness of his collectionstheir silhouettes, their fabrications, their embellishments, their presentation. This is not a bad thing! But one of the things he wants to control is the meaning of his clothes. Which means his collections are about what theyre aboutno less, and (heres the rub) no more. In lieu of interpretation, theres description. And as usual, Brownes outing today was a feast for the eyes. He offered the audience a red herring in the set: It seemed, thanks to the feet sticking out from under the bare-bones house hed installed at the center of his runway, that there was a Wizard of Oz theme afoot. You might have validated that guess in the way the collection shifted, at one point, from all-grayscale looks to ones in color. But no. The real clues were in the desks inside the house the models sat at after concluding their deliberate dfil, and in their little jackets and pleated skirts, and in the Japonerie motifs inscribed on those tailored pieces, in elaborate and nearly trompe loeil ways. Browne was riffing on the aesthetic, and the mien, of Japanese schoolgirls. Cest tout. The decoration of Brownes looks was awe-inspiring, at the levels of both inventiveness and craft. The reiterated jackets and pleated skirts were collaged together or embroidered in ways to evoke Mount Fuji landscapes or patterns of cherry blossom or koi or Edo-style illustrations of geishas. Certain looks expanded the canvas of the clothes to include intarsia minks. Others, like the jaw-dropping ribbon-embroidered pastel sack jacket, gave a more abstract, watercolor effect. The techniques and the silhouettes varied, but a sense of uniformity prevaileda sense Browne imparted purposefully, of course. Theres undoubtedly a pair of trousers languishing in the sales collection associated with the one Browne showed on the catwalk, but the story Browne was telling at his show was emphatically one of jackets, pleated skirts, coordinated long button-downs worn as layering pieces, and frequently, a coat. The individual garments betrayed Brownes idiomatic sense of whimsy and wit, but as a whole, they towed a party line. The only exception was in the finale look, a radiantly iridescent confection of floor-length layered pleats. This was the schoolmarm, and by the time she emerged from backstage, Browne had more than made his point. Its a credit to his artistry that it was a pleasure to see it underlined.$$Thomas Taits show this afternoon was one of those odd outings that dont seem at first to be up to much, but then accrue in force as the looks accumulate. The impact of Taits latest collection generated from the ways the clothes forced your engagement, whether via the play of light on assertive, multicolor crystal embellishment, or the sound made by the jewelry that dangled off of certain pieces, jangling like cat bells. The most intriguing of Taits stratagems to command your attention were the porthole-like openings that decorated all manner of his garmentsthey were like little windows for Peeping Toms to peer through, and the more Tait reiterated the motif, the more you keyed into the collections compelling voyeuristic tone. Tait intended that reaction: As he explained backstage after the show, he wanted these clothes to create a sense of awkward intimacy. Job done. Others of Taits engaging effects were more subtle. He was playing quite a lot with texture here, notably in his ribbed knits and his terrific jeans, with their patches of super-shiny black patent leather; other looks pulled you in with their wabi-sabi appeal, like the frayed quilted jacket and coat, or a leather A-line skirt made from antique calfskin. Tait also used the skin in his strangest look, a heavy jumpsuit featuring a monumental pattern and exaggerated perforation down the sides. The piece was interesting on its own, but something of an outlier in the context of the rest of the show, which emphasized rather accessible silhouettes. Taits stovepipe skinny knit flares, for instance, ought to excite widespread demand. Ditto his ribbed knits, and the cuffed jeans and denim jacket. If Taits goal was to create intimacy, he nailed it in those most straightforward looks: The best way to be intimate with clothes, after all, is by wearing them.$$Celebrating their 10th anniversary as a trio (Gabi Asfour, Angela Donhauser, and Adi Gil), minus one from an earlier incarnation, Threeasfours designers feel as tightly bound as ever, finishing each others sentences and moving about in lockstep. This year the brand is also celebrating the win of the National Design Award for Fashion Design from Cooper Hewitt, a prestigious honor backed by the First Ladyquite a different image from its other first lady, Bjrk. This is a new dawn for Threeasfour, and the designers wanted to demonstrate the newfound serenity, purity, and wearability, noted Gabi, with a higher message of unity for Spring. Were like the United Nations of fashion and art, added Adi. Against a large-scale fractal projection by video artist Alex Czetwertynski, the opening look set the just-futuristic-enough tone with its spirals of 3-D-printed digital lace and what the designers call topographic sandals. A series of finely cut and layered organza and voile pieces followedthe curvilinear, no-corners look thats become the label's signatureas well as a foray into mens with lapel-less jackets and coats. As always, textures were an integral part of the story; they ranged from waxed cotton and neoprene to milky latex and clear vinyl. Those fractals returned as prints as the palette of crisp white and shiny champagne gave way to deep earthy reds. In spite of its seasoned new maturity, Threeasfour can still deliver a drop-jaw moment, which here came as clusters of mica mineral sheets adorning the front of a dress and, in another look, chunks of various agate crystals linked together to form a bodice. The message was clear: Threeasfour is rock solid.$$Designers often refer to a new collection as their baby, but at her presentation in her Chelsea town house today, Tia Cibani had the real thing sleeping upstairs. Five days ago, Cibani gave birth to a baby boy, the second of her two children. While the timing wasnt exactly convenient, Cibani made the most of it, graciously showing guests around her spacious, modern home and sneaking upstairs when she could. Plus, since Cibani was pregnant throughout the design process, there was a tidy logic to showing the collectionher other babyso close to giving birth. Cibani was inspired by lush and exotic landscapes in Brazil, and the dichotomy between the countrys vibrant, festive Samba culturewhich inspired the colorful brushstroke printand the serene beauty of Bahia, which influenced the monochromatic looks made from lightweight linen blends. Cibani had a lot of fun with texture this seasonfor example, mixing hand-embroidered tufted fabrics with raw silks and bouclwhich made the head-to-toe black and white looks the strongest. A collaboration with Mt. Washington Pottery that yielded long ceramic necklaces, like mini sculptures, emphasized the earthiness of the collection.  Exotic locales aside, it was Cibanis pregnancy that helped inform the loose silhouettes and practical versatility of each piece: Standouts included a jumpsuit that came in black-and-white sueded cupro and had an adjustable wraparound tie, and a billowy ecru coat that was finished with white tape. Each look was styled with slip-on Birkenstock flats.  Its like yoga clothes, but elevated, said Cibani, who, not inconsequentially, did a lot of prenatal yoga while pregnant. Overall, the feeling of the collection is more relaxed.$$Kind of chilled out. Thats how designer Amy Smilovic described her latest outing, which was all about easesomething well no doubt be grateful for when the sticky days of summer (or, as in todays case, early fall) start rolling in again. As a rule, silhouettes were long and loose and mostly came in silk or cotton. Smilovic said she was inspired by recent trips to Miami and Malibu, which put her on a restorative kick and got her thinking about individuality. I think with the whole normcore thing people fall too much into uniforms, she said. I know Im craving to mix it up. For Smilovic that meant getting out of her comfort zone, working with elements that are almost tacky, and making them more refined. The once-loathed Bermuda short, which came in a variety of colors and materials including a surprising iridescent silk taffeta, were a mainstay of the collection. Color combinations, like forest green offset by a muted turquoise or sapphire paired with slate blue, were delightfully off-kilter. Smilovic is not a sequin person, but in the spirit of trying something new, she coated dresses, skirts, tops, and shorts in the shiny stufftweaking silhouettes and palette to ensure it stayed on the right side of tacky. For instance, on a pair of sequin shorts, the crotch and hem were dropped and the silhouette kept loose, to turn on its ear what you would imagine, when you think of a Miami woman in a sequin short.  The sequins were employed to surprisingly sophisticated and beautiful effect on an ankle-grazing dress, which came in black and pale pink and interspersed strips of the sparkly material with sheer fabric in the same hue. But the dress that every fashion girl will want to wear come spring was the slinky slip dress in nude or oxblood, updated with a round neckline and thick straps. Smilovic often styles her own shows but this season she worked with Vanessa Traina Snow, and the stylists knack for minimalism can be seen in these unadorned slip dresses, which were worn without jewelry. Expect to see those and the billowy off-the-shoulder tops on the street next season.$$As seems to be de rigueur at the moment (see Raf Simons), Belgian designer Tim Coppens delved into the mist of his own adolescent psyche for Spring. Quite logically, the womens collectionshown in an empty storefront, where the lookbook was being shot, around the corner from his Soho studiois practically a mirror image of his menswear. After all, mens was his first calling, for which he won a CFDA Fashion Award last year, establishing the upstart among New York's fashion firmament. For 30-something Belgians, plunging into 90s-era adolescence necessarily means a revisit of clubland. Indeed, Coppens said he went to raves every weekend for five years. He translated that time definitely not wasted into melting mushroom prints on bowling-league jackets and sweatshirts, an amoeba print taken from his teenage notebook, and a fantastic Prince of Wales blue seersucker evocative of ballpoint doodles. Bomberssome cropped, others keeping their original mens proportionswere another highlight; they came baggy yet richly detailed with pockets, padding, and raw edges. Thick-rib tanks and Japanese denim skirts in darker shades lent another dose of not-too-retro appeal. Despite the rave-girl roots, traces of grown-up tailoring ran throughout in silky evening jackets and a floor-length diaphanous black tunic. Meanwhile, the sponsors of that CFDA Fashion Award, Swarovski, have clearly taken a shine to Coppens, supplying him with loads of beadspearly ones, not flashy rhinestones, in keeping with his minimalist tendencies.$$First and foremost, Timo Weilands clothes are meant to be wearable. Add flattering and comfortable to the list, too. Weiland and his codesigners, Donna Kang and Alan Eckstein, are very much a part of the New York fashion scene, but they arent about to endorse completely sheer dresses or high-concept frippery. That doesnt mean the clothes are boring, though; it seems the goal of every contemporary label is to master easy to-wear pieces that still feel special. Over the past few seasons, the three have gotten closer to that target by sharpening their focus and embracing a new, richer vision. For their Spring collection, they were inspired by the sweet, heady feeling of a new relationship. Its when you want to feel really pretty, but also comfortable, Kang explained. For example, their flowing skirts and dresses had to pass the cross-legged test, so you wouldnt think twice about sprawling out on the grass with your special someone. Little cutouts and bow-tie details also managed to be feminine but not cloying; the same was true of the ballet pink, navy, white, and olive color palette. Elsewhere, the trio relied on soft textures to inject a sense of romance: see the cable-knit sweater paired with a fraying tweed skirt, or a crisp, strapless poplin tunic layered over silk pants. Either of those looks would make an ideal starting point for girls hoping to embrace the seasons breezier, less structured sensibilities without going too far outside their comfort zone.$$For her Spring 2016 collection, Alessandra Facchinetti decided to start a band. And not just any band, but the Traveling Wilburys of comely young creative talents: Fifteen strong personalities who dont follow the rules because they make their own, which is why they have such a following, said the show notes, and among them were Langley Fox, Chelsea Tyler, Quentin Jones, and Elizabeth Jagger, some of whom walked in the show, some of whom sat front row. (All, however, were present in portrait form via a series of Sonia Sieffshot images, which proudly hung in the entryway.) Beyond the rules, cried the show notes, and to that end, the proceedings began with a rockabilly strain: cropped trousers with paper-bag waists under Cry-Baby quiffs and paper-thin T-shirts that slipped off the shoulder, or leather jackets personalized with guitar-themed patchwork. Collared shirts had leather detailing, and long silk dresses were printed with vinyl records, or were not actually silk at all, rather delicately perforated pale shades of leather. The accessories had attitude, too: the sinuous wave bag (in an array of sizes, with the guitar straps slung over the shoulder or carried in hand), the iconic Gommino loafer, here boasting celestial silver adornments, safety pins, or bedazzled accents. A soft sneaker came, on occasion, fastened with saddlery detail, while a standout striped flat in an extended slipper style will prove just the thing for a spot of Im with the band cool when sported with jeans come spring. Bag closures and a glossy, perfect loafer sported a subtle, graphic new logoa pair of gilded Ts with overlapping stems, all pure form and linewhich, when considering a motif to demonstrate where the house has been and where its going, hit just the right note.$$A clay-hued backdrop, replete with a trio of eerily lit trees, set the naturalistic tone at Togas London Fashion Week runway debut. Under the banner of Petals, Minerals, Squiggles, designer Yasuko Furuta explored her complex woman with varying degrees of success. In line with the chaotic weather patterns of her adopted city of London (and back home in Tokyo), Furuta showed the kind of trans-seasonal daywear that is trending right now. Okay, so the heavy mesh white coat appliqud with a cascading nude ruffle wouldnt provide much cover in a downpour, but it was so pretty. Furuta has lost none of her inventive eye for detailing: bronze panels of fish-scale sequins and calcified fabrics had a distinct, mossy look. But occasionally things veered towards the chaoticwith one too many layers or colors on some of the pleated skirts that have become her signature. Still, there was much to lust after. An opulent take on suiting was sublimely inventivewith riding check, heavy satin, and tailored skirt-fronted tops with a ruffle-edgeworn over tapered trousers. These flourishes were Furutas subtle allusion to her theme, their shapes borrowed from the blue and yellow blooms in the on-set trees. The flowery feel was echoed in the bags toomost memorably on a drawstring mesh number with a petal-shaped red lacquered top. A bag for all seasons then, made with that complex woman in mind.$$Tomas Maier spends part of the year in Miamiits where he opened his first store back in 2004. He knows sunglasses, and it shows in the new line of shades hes launching for Spring 2016. Stripped of excesses and more classic than trendy, the metal frame and acetate styles are a good metaphor for his brand, which stands for elegance and simplicity and prices that dont make your eyes roll back into your head. Theres enough of that elsewhere, no? His aviators and navigators are thin, their lenses flush with the frame, and very lightweight; they look more expensive than their under-$300 tag. Maier knows his way around a sundress, too. Hes got a trio of them in washed linen for Spring, their bright pink and red hues slightly faded in parts, like souvenirs from a summer holiday. Another dress in cotton with a zigzagging tie-dye motif is sure to have you dreaming about your next warm-weather getaway. As much as he likes palm trees (theyre printed on a denim dress, and flocked in velvet on the hem of a wrap skirt) and the chill, laid-back vibes they connote, its not all about the seaside at TM. Theres a softly tailored suit in poppy red silk this season and knit cardigans in shrunken proportions that city dwellers will snap up. And heres something youll be seeing a lot of on the streets next spring: the oversize, slightly Yves Saint Laurentin-the-seventies proportions of Maiers peasant blouses tucked into full wrap skirts.$$Ramon Martin and Ryan Lobo have had some pretty impressive women pinned to Tomes mood board in seasons past, including Louise Bourgeois, Sylvia Plath, and Dorothy Parker to name a few. For Spring, though, their muse, the pioneering Australian visual artist Fiona Hall, fell a lot closer to home. Ryan and I discovered her before we knew each other, when we were both in high school, said Martin who, like his design partner, grew up Down Under. We saw her latest project at the Venice Biennale recently, and immersed ourselves in her work all over again. That powerful energy was reflected in the shows casting today: The lineup featured unexpected faces, such as veteran 90s models Claudia Mason and Esther de Jong. More familiar themes came through in the clothes themselves: Menswear stripes, deconstructed trenchcoats, and shirting are fast becoming Tome signatures. With Halls thought-provoking sardine can art as a starting point, the palette was somewhat subdued for a Spring collection. Painterly flourishes did appear in the form of a palm frond print on a lightweight coat with billowing sleeves, a leitmotif that was created by an artist friend in the labels Chelsea studio. There was an artisanal touch to the fish scale lace panels of one blush pink jacket too, and a white lace evening dress came peppered with crystals. Overall, the voluminous silhouette recalled the exuberance of a particular set of late-70s muses, and you could imagine Marie Helvin, Jerry Hall, or Pat Cleveland swirling on the dance floor of famed Parisian nightclub Le Sept in any of the ruffled peasant skirts and halter tops, even if the more layered, paper-bag belted looks would be tricky for mere mortals to pull off. Still, many of the piecesthose charming asymmetrical ruffled blouses in particularwill hold their own in a modern working wardrobe come the spring.$$Palm trees, sun-soaked beaches, rum punch . . . island life presents what is arguably the most alluring of chill situations. Tommy Hilfiger, who has been a regular visitor to the isle of Mustique for the past 30 years, would know. And today he took the fashion world on a mini tropical escape with his Spring 2016 show, where the runway was a boardwalk circumscribing a lagoon, complete with its own beach-bar shack.  Of course its impossible to envision the Caribbean without thinking of its biggest cultural icon: Bob Marley. Beyond his musical legacy, his influence on fashion continues to reverberate. If the number of times his face has been printed on a T-shirt were counted in music sale units, his image would have gone platinum a thousand times over.  There were no Bob shirts on the runway today. Instead, all the coolest things in his wardrobe were taken apart and redone in a youthful, playful way: knitted bucket hats in sunny colors, mesh vests done as floor-length cover-ups, and his signature soccer tracksuit rendered in burgundy suede and finished with crochet insets. And speaking of crochet, the boho textile was all over the collection, including the neckline of patchwork and billowing chiffon dresses. The crochet bathing suit, that linchpin of a 70s bohemian wardrobe, was re-created in several ways, too, and it was refreshing to see Gigi Hadid, a model whose gorgeous womanly body recalls the first wave of free-spirited travelers that came to Jamaica in the late 60s, striding down the runway in a string bikini. Reason enough to want to run off to a tropical island, or at least dress the part until you can.$$The front row at Topshop Unique never fails to attract a gaggle of spirited British It girls, and today was no different, with the likes of Alexa Chung, Suki Waterhouse, and Poppy Delevingne all in attendance. And although the show notes described the muse of the season, in vague terms, as a beautiful British rebel who is first past the post at any social engagement, collectively the pretty young things in the audience embodied that spirit in spades. The collection started off with looks that borrowed from the classics of an English gents wardrobeperhaps because certain high-profile tomboys do abide by the motto Theres nothing sexier than a woman in a mans clothing. Its why cricket vests were peppered with holes that alluded to the skin, cinched with skinny patent leather belts and then layered over jumbo polka-dot skirts or ankle-nipping cigarette pants. The oversize pin-striped blazer, a city boy favorite, was redone as a minidress and worn with huge mismatched earrings, while traditional white button-down shirts were toughened up with leather. The most convincing pieces in the collection had a gentler sway about them, though, one that spoke to the soft, feminine mood thats in the air overall this season. The array of chiffon dressesone of which was covered in a charming strawberry patternhad an innocent garden-party feeling that was anything but fusty. With printed lingerie to match the motif of each diaphanous frock, the look presented a fresh answer to the naked dress conundrum, namely: What on earth do you wear underneath it? For party girls who just want to have fun, what solution could be more appealing than that?$$For her Spring 2016 show, Tory Burch picked the bright and airy promenade of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as the location, citing beauty found in unexpected places . . . enhanced through time and nature as her inspiration. Her point was underlined by the large oxidized bronze structure that loomed at the rear of the runway. Yes, Burch seemed to say, even in the era of the new and now, some things really do get better with age. (Even fashion!)  And to that end, out came some need-it-now spins on the trends of this summer and next: Blocky striped knit tops worn with a wide-leg, high-waisted trouser embroidered with a design that lay somewhere between an Aztec and a botanical diagram, brightly accented narrow guipure lace separates in periwinkle and saffron, fringed-tweed wrap skirts, tassel-hemmed linen trapeze tops, and embroidered folk blouses of Mexican and Romanian origin rendered in pale blue striped cotton shirting. All were done in the most utterly Tory way, which is to say both pretty and entirely prep-friendly, without any of the resulting bloodlessness. They were primed for sultry season promenades from Amagansett to the Amalfi Coast, paired with pumps and pearls or whatever next must-have sneaker the future has in store. (And for the latter, remember, here comes Tory Sport.) The closing section of caftans and skirts in gray perforated leather and iridescent fil coupe organza didnt seem to follow the same trackits hard to imagine them fitting in at East Coast havens like the Siasconset Casino or Maidstone Club. But the mod-inspired narrow tunics sported over flowing trousers and shorts (the version in khaki linen burlap edged in crystal embroidery provoking a mild sense of euphoria among showgoers planning future summer party outfits) would be equally successful on a woman of 16 or 60falling fully on the right side of history.$$Tracy Reese has been associated with bright, retro-tinged floral prints; nipped-waist skirts; and sparkle for nearly 20 years. Shes the kind of designer who wears a tea-length taffeta dress with platform sandals and vintage earrings on a Tuesday afternoon. For Spring, her clothes were as glam and girly as ever, but there was a new, deconstructed ease. I always love shape, but I wanted to find a way to do that without so much structure, Reese explained backstage. One way she added dimension without hard lines was with layered textures: rough-cut swaths of lace over a shimmering slip; paper-thin PVC thrown over a brocade shift; a nubby linen trench dotted with crystals. Shine was a big message this season, and the light-catching, dance floorready pieces were easily the most exciting. Even a boxy sequin T-shirt had more attitude than the boldest, most eye-popping print. It felt effortless, like you could throw it on and get to the party within five minutes flat. Prints are Reeses signature, but it would be refreshing to see her explore texture and that undone quality a bit further; its more in line with what girls want to wear, too.$$Its a good moment for Pookie Burch and Louisa Burchs Trademark. With Alessandro Micheles Gucci the current benchmark of cool, the sisters oddball quirk and slightly retro sensibility should find a whole new audience. Until now, Trademarks Soho outpost has operated as something of an insiders secret, the place editors and stylists go for a pair of high-rise floods or a vintage-look sweater. We expect the Spring collection, with its crinkle patent jacket and skirt, its tomato intarsia crewneck, and its slightly daffy see-through trench, will lure in fans of fashions new nerd-chic look. Those of you whove been watching Trademark since its late-2013 launch, however, will clock a distinct maturity to this lineup. Alongside some of the showier pieces, there were trim linen shirts, an easy-to-wear poplin dress with a micro-pleated sash, and smart trousers with subtle slits above the ankles. The Burches did cashmere for the first time this season, and their tube-trim, oversize V necks have a luxe hand. They also gave eveningwear a go; a taffeta dress with pliss shoulders and a wrap detail at the waist retained the casual polish of their more familiar daywear. Speaking of polished, the Trademark logo tape on the inside of shirt cuffs was a delicious little detail, as were the mini pom-poms tracing the sleeve seams on a pair of boatneck sweaters.$$For Spring 2016, Trina Turk left her beloved native Californiaa place that has consistently provided her with inspirational fodderfor a fresh locale across the pond. Ive been to Capri a few times over the years, said Turk, and we realized wed never done a Mediterranean-inspired collection. The season begins on the Cte dAzurSaint-Tropezs iconic striped umbrellas inspired a handful of nautical items, while Cannes and Cap Ferrat informed some of the more city-appropriate looksbefore traveling down the coast to Italian vacation destinations like Positano and Capri. The influence of those seaside spots was apparent in the vibrant color palette and party frocks and beach cover-upsdone up in packable matte jersey and crochetthat had a little dolce vita to them. Pants continue to be big for the brand: Lace flares, silky culottes, and printed wide-leg versions provided ample two-legged alternatives for cocktail hour. The kick flare has been a huge hit for the label, and for Spring it comes in a crop, tooa style that was actually part of some of Turks earlier collections and that shes happy to see circle back. But the silhouette the designer is most excited about is a twist on the classic caftan dress: roomy and scarf-like but with spaghetti straps. With the 20th anniversary of the brand behind her, Turk is feeling even more confident in the labels core sensibility. This season, we thought: Lets just be more Trina Turk than ever, she said. That played out in bold floral patterns that mostly wound up on the right side of sixties and seventies kitsch. But despite the retro vibe, Turk is definitely a woman of the present: One print was sourced from contemporary illustrator Lisa Congdon, who Turk foundwhere else?on Instagram.$$Gaia Trussardi was already deep into her research for this collection when she caught a National Geographic documentary about Australian writer Robyn Davidson. During the late 70s Davidson spent nine months traversing Western Australia accompanied only by four camels and a dog (who didnt make it); her ensuing account of the adventure, Tracks, was a hitthink Wild, without the relationship problems. It represented the moods and characteristics of a woman I was thinking about, said Trussardi. The need for a contact with nature. How nature can fill you up. The result was a collection intended to appear sandblasted, wind-whipped, and faded by the sun. Long-skirted jackets and pleated full pants in neutral striped herringbone linen were left unfinished and tattered at the edges. The ribboned bib on a blue shirt was ruffled as if by force. Shirtsmore like caftanswere delivered ankle-length, split to the hip, and worn as layers under jackets or as a piece of outerwear. The beaded prints were created from blown-up images of religious tribal masks and the models all wore Virgin Mary necklaces. The palette swerved from neutral to pastel with debatable success; these rough-hewn, heavy-textured loose pieces rather disagreed with the prissiness of soft pink and apricot. Trussardi has complained that when it comes to using leather in her collections, she is damned if she does (so obvious!) and if she doesnt (why didnt she?!). Today she went with wrap split skirts and a fine raspberry duster jacket in double-layered suede and yellow jerkin-like calfskin crop tops, as well as a long gown with a half-moon panel that was cut too narrow to walk easily in. The oversize stitching detail on her penultimate look, a black suit, was a nod to Trussardis glove-making DNA. Overall, this collection was neither a triumph nor a catastrophe; that blue look was pretty good, the tailoring fine (cummerbunds apart), and there was plenty to catch the eye of liberal-leaning acai eaters in search of clothes that signal urbane rusticity and luxurious roughness.$$At first glance it was hard to believe Tina Lutzs new collection for TSE was inspired by Rastafarians. The label is known for golf courseappropriate twin sets, after all. But Lutz used to frequent Jamaica with her husband, where they hung out in the mountains, made friends with locals, and bonded over jerk chicken and curried goat. Its just so different from anything you know, she explained. Dont expect the typical red, green, and yellow color palette, though. Lutzs mood board was covered in photos from Beth Lessers 2008 book Dancehall: The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture, which documented Rastafarian style in the early 80s. Their look was heavy on crisp whites and pastels, but it was really all in the details: pointelle stitching, skinny stripes, and clever seam details took sweaters and polos to a much more eccentric place. Lutz merged those retro vibes with TSEs complex knit techniques, like a pointelle cashmere sweater printed over the top with a custom digital pattern and shot through with feeder stripes. Considering TSE is first and foremost a cashmere brand, her challenge was to make those knits superlight so you could actually wear them on the beach. She also mixed in billowy voile pants, crisp shirting, and a standout raffia jacket for good measure. The jacket felt intentionally raw and unfinished, but the hazy stripes were actually sprayed on with an ink jet. It summed up TSEs current vision quite succinctly: On one hand, the brand is artisanal and low-tech with a rich history, but it's also completely up to date with modern technology.$$For the first time, instead of a runway show, Tsumori Chisato opted to stage a presentation. The cozier format forced her to self-edit, and the final cut totaled roughly half what she normally shows. This couldnt have been easy for the persistently playful Japanese designer, who dives deep into her themes and doesnt resurface until she has exhausted every visual metaphor. The underwater world offers no shortage of source material, all conducive to Tsumorphing: Highlights included an orange neoprene flipper handbag, metallic seaweed floating along an organza blouse, a blue tent dress bubbling with broderie anglaise, and an airy ivory number covered in delicate frond-like forms (bookmark this one if youre planning an offbeat beach wedding). As usual, she represented herself in the collection; suited up in scuba gear, her alter ego paused at the edge of fraying hot pants and swam around the base of a wavy striped maxi dress. The oddest depiction showed her delivering a golden eye to a submerged sleeping giant. Indeed, soaking up these details would have been difficult on the runway; either youd focus on the drawings and unique finishings, or try to determine whether the clothes were wearablewhich they were. Invariably, Chisato sticks to simple dress silhouettes, easy outerwear, and basic shapes that allow the body to breathe (one exception: a Grecian-style gown with an unusual drop-waist drawstring). The models paused long enough for the eye to drift downward, discovering pearls trapped in clear platforms, like Air Max soles embedded with treasures. Chisato made sure to point them out to Kenzo Takada, who took in the 28 looks by her side. He listened intently the entire time, smiling as she spun her stories.$$Ulla Johnson is the rare contemporary designer whose clothes tell a vivid story but also resonate with real-life customers. Her biggest stockist is Barneys New York, but the brand is expanding rapidly into top luxury boutiquesplus its all over Instagram, which means new shoppers are discovering it every day. That commercial success has made it possible for Johnson to really delve into her aesthetic, which she describes as a tapestry of cultures. That means theres everything from Peruvian ikat prints to Indian embroidery and touches of Western fringe, but its all elevated for city-dwelling women like Johnson herself. The designer frequently travels to Peru to develop her luxe knitwear, but a recent trip to Japan actually made her see the beauty in being home. I really just fell in love with America again, she explained. Theres a huge Japanese market for vintage Levis and bandanas, but Johnson opted for a mix of her own nostalgic references: macram and crochet details inspired by Santa Fe; a color palette of faded rose, taupe, and marigold sourced from Richard Diebenkorn paintings; icy-blue denim seen on wide-leg jeans and a ruffled dress; and a pristine white Victorian lace gown. Perhaps the collection hung together so well because the clothes felt genuine and familiarweve all owned a peasant dress or chunky cardigan at some point. The idea of revisiting those classic piecesupdated with rich textures and more flattering silhouettesfeels just as fresh as trying whatever the brand-new trend is.$$Jun Takahashis Undercover collections usually have a message, but you dont have to get his deeper meanings to appreciate what he does. After his show at the Cirque dHiver today, Takahashi talked about righteous aggression. The people need to be strong, he said. His backstage sentiments jibed with a soundtrack that featured a live version of the Rolling Stoness song for the have-nots, Salt of the Earth. Takahashi came at his insurrectionary message both subtly and less so. To start, he mashed up jackets and coats with backpacks to give his tailoring a ready-for-battle attitude. There were zip-up pockets front and back and on the hips; some jackets were so transformed that their fronts were mere straps covering bare breasts. It couldve been a silly exercise, but Takahashi is a clever tailor, with a wicked sense of humor. In another sign hes down with the people, he co-opted low-culture concert T-shirts for high-fashion purposes. The Stoness young faces stared out from inside the four suits of a card deck on a miniskirt and at the hems of pants. For every have-not, theres a have. Takahashi turned playing-card royals into a print on blazers with the kings and queens eyes blacked out like the donts on a dos-and-donts list.  Royalty is a motif Takahashi has used before to equally witty effect, but the vibe was slightly more incendiary this time around. Oversize floral prints couldve been exploding bombs. Perhaps not. Either way, his tweaked and twisted sportswear is easy to get behind.$$Russian designer Valentin Yudashkin wanted to take a break from black, a decision that could have been motivated by any number of influences outside the fashion realm, but probably just boiled down to newness. Thing is, he does black very well and was finding his groove from a balance of precise tailoring and sexy sportswear. Surely some more recently arrived clients might soon be wishing he indulged his darker side a bit longer before pivoting sharply back to color. But for all the early-80s evocations, Yudashkins focus remained forward: He used neoprene and technical mesh inserts to update suiting, day dresses, and a versatile motorcycle jacket, and ornamented eveningwear with acrylic, geometric embellishments. Yudashkin mentioned being inspired by contemporary art this season and singled out painter Piotr Uklanski as the strongest influence. Indeed, the drip print that seeped down a jumpsuit or splashed forth in sequins on a hot, disco-worthy number nodded directly to the Polish artist. However, the designer was at his most original when he showed a weightless pastel dress topped with a bouncy neon green blouson; this felt fresh and not overworked. On the few occasions when he did seem to overwork a designthe final gowns that swirled wildly in a riot of magenta and red taffeta and tullehe did so with the conviction that this represents glamour today. If you do it from the heart, the customers will follow, he said backstage, of his vibrant collection. He sounded too sincere to object.$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking deeply about Africa when they were designing for Spring, and not on a whim. For more than a year, tens of thousands of refugees from Senegal, Nigeria, Eritrea, Mali, Gambia, and elsewhere have been making the harrowing journey across the Mediterranean to southern Italy. Packed into unseaworthy vessels, many are dying in appalling circumstances before they reach shore, a humanitarian crisis Italy has been dealing with by patrolling the seas, saving survivors, and giving them sanctuary. As in Germany, which has been receiving hundreds of thousands fleeing from the war in Syria, there has been a backlash against the new arrivals from some quarters. And this is what the Valentino designers want to counteract. We probably feel that the greatest privilege in doing our work is that fashion can give a message, said Chiuri. We think every person coming here is an individual, and we can show that we can improve ourselves by understanding other cultures. The message, added Piccioli, is tolerance. And the beauty that comes out of cross-cultural expression. On appearances, you would not necessarily guess at the very real and fraught situation running in the background of this serene and heartfelt Valentino collection, but the research, and the lengths the designers had gone to to educate themselves, resulted in some gorgeous fusions between Italian and African traditions. They met in the textiles and the way the Roman influences Chiuri and Piccioli had used in their couture show segued into tribal treatmentsthe strips of leather that began as a gladiator reference became studded; the Roman sandals gained carved ebony heels; the pagan necklaces of their former show now appeared in white ceramic, suggesting abstracted teeth or shells; and the house expertise in embroidery produced tiny beaded Masai-derived patterns and bold peacock feather trims. Both designers pointed out that their respectful borrowings are hardly new; they are part of a history of Western assimilation that goes back to Picasso and Braques embrace of African art in the 1920s, which, Chiuri said, was the birth of modernism in art. It came over as most modern in this show when it was at its most subtle, as in the black dress embellished with multiple layers of suede fringing, or in the manipulation of tie-dye patterns used as a camouflage-like material for summer utility jackets and cargo pants. In the end, though, while customers may not even notice the roots of the simple, breezy cotton printed Valentino dresses they are buying, the important thing is that the designers have used this opportunity to spell out where they stand on an issue very close to home. It will definitely be heard in Italy. Fashion is a frivolous and joyful thing, but that doesnt prevent some of the people who are making it from having inquiring minds and a public conscience.$$Vanessa Brunos flagship store had been propped with sleek, modular planter boxes and bowls piled with lemons and pomegranates to create a lush ambiance for her South Americaninfluenced collection. Never mind the fact that pomegranates originated in the Middle East, this outing was less about geographical accuracy than an exploration of artisanal techniques. Bruno, in fact, said she began the season by thinking about a wardrobe for a hot weather getaway and ended up refining the idea so that the clothes would be easily packable without sacrificing style. She doubled down on crochet, inflecting it with Parisian flair, not just in form (a graphic striped bra top) but also in application (paired with crisp gauchos). Dresses eschewed volume for eye-catching finesse, from grosgrain detailing to sunset hues. Indeed, when Bruno pointed to a dress featuring a laced crochet bodice and loosely pleated skirt as being most emblematic of the season, one could envision unpacking it, along with the raffia sandals and turquoise-accented jewelry, and instantly entering into vacation mode. As for concerns about the visibly creased cotton, which might give the impression of being stuffed carelessly into a suitcase, it actually contained a barely visible metal thread that acts as a memory to maintain shape. It reinforced how Bruno was going for soign, not starched.$$Vanessa Seward opened her store on the Rue dAlger last month, and from the looks of the crowd at her show today, its been a busy place. Amid other sightings, two high-profile Parisians turned up in the same tweed blazer from her first collection for Fall in identical white jeans and almost identical cashmere sweaters. Its puzzling why so few designers put pieces on the runway that could step right off it onto the street. Thats why what Sewards doing with her new line is a hit. The fantasy is the reality.  This afternoons show started with a clever voice-over created by her husband, music producer Bertrand Burgalat, in which Sewards impressions of French women got the Auto-Tune treatment: They have this whole effortless thing that I really admire, she says over the electronic music. Backstage she added, Its my homage to the charm of French women. Seward is no slouch in the personal style department, of course. She had a cosmopolitan upbringing, moving first to London and then to Paris from her native Argentina, and she imbued her new collection with some of that international flavor, cinching Argentine gaucho belts over a couple of dresses and adding a few nods to YSL in Marrakech into the mix. The silvery lam was more about time travel, back to the glam 70s. It looked great on a maxi dress. But she didnt shy away from doing smart basics  la A.P.C., with whom shes partnered on the label, either. Seward makes a great trench, and there was new denim in the form of an A-line button-front skirt that she paired with a T-shirt that read Vanessas Way. Has a nice ring to it, doesnt it?$$I love the mix between schoolteacher andshowgirl, Vera Wang said backstage. Theres real life, then theres fantasy life. Thats potent material; theres a reason that Luis BuuelsBelle de Jour,which was a loose reference point here, became the classic it did. Indeed, dichotomy has long defined Wangs ready-to-wear. Masculine and feminine, tailoring and flou. Shes fashions punk ballerina, a world-famous bridal designer who wears only black. Duality was again the order of the day for her new Spring collection, but the results were somewhat mixed. Tailored coats topped only the barest of bandeaux and high-waisted briefs. More quizzical was a structured vest that turned to reveal it was a dickey of sorts, completely bare in back. And the practical applications of a loose V-neck tank cropped below the bust in black mink were hard to discern. Wang knows her way around a mash-up, but there was a disconnect between her fancy evening dresses and the athletic mesh bras underneath that she never quite resolved. Piece by piece she did beautiful work. Black ostrich plumes added romance to a sleeveless blazer in nude techno gazar, chrome and gold pailletteembroidered dresses were eye-catching, and Wang, the wedding dress queen, cuts a smart pair of high-waisted cropped trousers. Reality, not fantasy, came out on top.$$New York Fashion Week is drawing to a close, and while weve still got the rest of the month to see collections in London, Milan, and Paris, New York City is where the trends take shape for contemporary labels. One major theme for the mid-range set was a simpler, more relaxed approach to getting dressed. Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard are best known for layering, particularly with their sharply tailored jackets and removable dickeys, which create the illusion of wearing a cable-knit turtleneck or Perfecto jacket underneath. But Spring presented a new focus that goes way beyond blazers. Miami was the Beards starting point, and models with wet, slicked-back hair stood in front of giant palm fronds wearing crisp white separates, soft suits, and breezy dresses. Its supposed to feel like they just jumped out of the pool and threw these clothes on, Swanson Beard explained. That translated to a looser, less rigid approach to tailoring: Even the sharpest pin-striped jacket was done in a soft piqu, and clingy silk dresses were unstructured, save for a drawstring waist or a row of ruched buttons on the side.  Of course, real-life wearability is a big factor when youre stocked in department stores, and while a few looks felt a bit formulaic, like a red off-the-shoulder dress, others appeared more womanly than what some of the designers peers are doing. And for girls looking to upgrade their dickey collection, there was a brand-new style to try here: lapel dickeys, which were slimmer and added just a little extra dimension.$$At Veronique Branquinhos Spring 2016 show today at the Htel dvreux, models wore long, flowing pleated dresses in muted tones of cream, black, and rainbow pastels (for a Victorian-meetsBurning Man effect), gauzy blindfolds, and occasionally trailed macram fringe, which extended from the neckline down to the ankle. It would not have been a stretch to imagine them with candlesticks in hand, too, a series of nightgown-clad Lady Macbeths coursing through the halls of the castle with some mind-warping affairs underway. There was a fair bit of deconstruction at hand, if not actual Shakespearean madness: well-tailored jackets and vests with the stitching picked out; tasseled, sheer layers with visible corsetry underneath; an array of utterly bewildering transparently backed trousers, exposing long, white Elizabethan-style undershorts worn underneath. Sheer tulle blouses possessed vaguely modesty-protecting ruffles on the breast, while suit trousers occasionally boasted a thick, white elastic waistband printed with the designers name  la 80s Calvin Klein. A medieval-looking print of flora and fauna was pleated on some frocks to expose the bounty when the dress was in movement, but most successful were the shoes: chunkily heeled brogues and smoking slippers with gently sloping toes in black and shagreen, red lizard, and creamy white patent.$$If Vronique Leroys program notes told one storyan intellectual young woman defining sexy on her own termsthe designer told another backstage after the show. For Spring, she tried to test the point at which seemingly mismatched outfits gain new allure. She did this primarily by pushing and pulling colors, proportions, and materials just enough that the outcome remained a tad shy of awry. Look 13 is a prime example: the crinkly white and sky blue striped silk blouson and wrap skirt paired with a black camisole and saffron belt strikes as simultaneously fresh and odd. The final passage made the same impact, as if the rounded sleeves, wide pants, and mix of check, knit mesh, and lace delivered the sartorial equivalent of a jolie laide. One imagines that Leroy spent much time calibrating the elements, whether at an early design stage or the very end in styling. But the coquettish black dress that repeated the same mix of mesh and lace was the opposite of overthought. A long-sleeved version in white and navy turned the trusty marinire into something to lust after. For all the possible traps, Leroy really only slipped up with the accessories (wide, asymmetric belts; oversize, droopy hoops; openwork booties), which werent problematic in design as much as overusedalthough maybe this was part of the exercise. And by the end, it became clear that the low-key professional women who have supported her for decades would not need to opt into this mismatched business to find their key looks. But if they feel compelled to venture slightly outside their comfort zone, Leroy has them covered.$$Just when you're feeling down, and a little bit battered and numbed by fashion in general, and perhaps thinking you've lost sight of the point of it all, along comes Donatella Versace to put it to rights. Before we start talking about the way her collection grabbed so many women in parts of themselves they never imagined Versace could reacheven those who like a boyish pant suit and flatswe should refer you to her soundtrack. It was not just an added-on musical theme, but the massively inclusive, confidence-generating Transition by Violet and friends. You'll have to listen to it, but long story short: It's a call to all women to stop listening to our inner demons and outer detractors, and just get rid of everything which stops us from doing what we really want. It was made for International Women's Day, said Donatella Versace, backstage. And when I heard it, I was so sure of myself. I wanted to challenge myself, to do something strong.  Which is surely the main reason she came up with the image of combat which marched through her showa reflection of the all-too-many wars which are raging now, maybe, but also of the resolution of her battle with herself to throw away self-imposed restraints, and just get on with making Versace relevant.  Relevant? We must now move toward thinking about what that oft-repeated, never-defined, and rather terrifying word means. Perhaps relevance is emotionally felt in fashion when its clear that its not just for one type of very thin, very young white girl; when it also represents on behalf of color, booty, and admirable women who are just a weensy bit more experienced than eighteen. And apart from that? When it comes to design, relevance in fashion also relates to where on earth the clothes are actually supposed to be worn. Can many people find things to put on daily? Or are we all going to continue to believe in the fiction that living in today's world is one long cocktail reception? Donatella Versace addressed all that by showing a collection which never ditched the beloved character of her family's house, but concentrated mostly on varying shades of daywear, shown on an inclusive cast of characters. The opening looks, all legs, with khaki tailored jackets cinched with webbing belts over micro shorts, above vertiginous platforms, were no surprise. What came next was: The Versace house print gone wild in punchy green camouflage tailored suits with slouchy boy-cut pants, collaged into knits and sweatshirts and swinging along in the form of backpacksall (amaze!) walking out on clogs and sporty slides.  It would not be Versace without an injection of sexinessa quality which has been so out of fashion recently that many designers appear terrified of it. This time, Donatella Versace did show some of the requisite chiffon, fluttery, spilt-to-the-thigh gowns, but the little, curvy, slashed and knotted dresses which came before them were far more interesting, shown as they were on girls striding out on what amounted to decorated clogs. It was a triumph which turned boredom into excitement and alienation into a visceral desire to shop. Whatever forces Donatella Versace was fighting to reach this new point of clarity, she won.$$As of now, Versus Versace as you see it here is already on sale onlineeven as the after-party, with the models and invited kids from far and wide, is still going on in a basement venue in London. With Anthony Vaccarello at the helm as creative director, Donatella Versace has turned Versus into a show-now, buy-now, wear-tomorrow collection, a shortcut to fashion availability which no one else in the designer world has yet quite fully pulled off.  But what will people be clicking on to purchase when they wake up tomorrow? Interesting to speculate; Vacarello is a fluent new-generation-channeler of the pulse of Versace. He gets the house codesthe lion-head medallions, the legginess, the body-conscious cutout-and-drape shapes, the tailoring. One thing he has not yet delved into is the color of Versacehes a confirmed fan of black in his own collection, and that hue dominated the Versus runway too. However, for the first time there were prints, botanical florals, and fruit patterns, plus such things as printed denim bomber jackets and jeans. It made for an impressively wide range for people all over the world to pick from, and plenty of opportunity for stocking up ahead of year-end parties. Still, in fashion, the eye always tends to go toward the outliers. In this case, that would be the simplest daywear look: a black leather shirt over tailored, hip-riding masculine pants. Maybe thats about as far from a stereotypical Versace look as can be imaginedand it stood out, in a good way. Meanwhile, who should be wearing something very similar backstage? Why, Donatella herself, in a narrow pair of black boy-pants and a black T-shirt. Surprise!$$The entity that goes under the name Vetements has caused quite a quake through fashionbottom-up, from nowhere. Just whenby looking at mainstream corporate luxury-goods normsit seemed that cool was dead and buried and nothing alternative could ever again survive, along came a couple of brothers, Demna and Guram Gvasalia, and their collective of friends, to prove skeptics wrong. Theres no faking the concrete truth of that. The visible evidence of their breakout is in the number of Vetements oversized blazers and giant MA-1 jackets, recycled firefighter sweaters, Antwerpen slogan shirts, and, especially, the flower-printed tea dresses with sweatshirting inserts that are being worn around the shows. Nobody seems to have consulted each other on this: They just went to shops, women and men alike; tried on the Vetements stuff; loved the way it made them look and feel; and impulsively paid up. Thats why those impulsive ones, plus a large contingent of the professionally curious, enthusiastically headed to Belleville today, to what turned out to be a large Chinese restaurant, to see the Vetements follow-up for Spring. The audience was not to be disappointed. The buzz and energy in that cheap and cheerful establishment, the freakishly beautiful club of the young and the strong who modeled, and the wildly impressive clothes they were wearing had all the makings of an unforgettable fashion landmark. At top speed,Demna Gvasalia and his co-conspirators confirmed everything their following likes about their off-kilter, elegant, giant-jacketed tailoring and clunky romantic dresses, and then bettered it all. There were argyle knits under sober menswear suits, sexy sawn-off skirts with Vetements-labeled thigh boots under coats, brilliant flashes of neon yellow and toxic green, striped mens shirts with superlong trailing cuffs, and corset T-shirts. Then came the dresses, in a stunning number of new, colorful, and punchy-sophisticated ideas. There were loose versions of prairie-flower prints with matching trailing coats, a green Lurex yoked smock, a navy polka-dot dress anchored on a black satin slip, and one outstanding mauve velvet dress cut to cling and slither across the body. And that was far from all. After most of the crowd had filtered out into the streets, Demna Gvasalia explained, Theres something in the collection which means a lot to everyone whos worked on itlike those rose-printed plastic tablecloths we made into aprons and dresses were an ode to my grandmother. Weve worked really hard on developing more jeans, too, and leather. The point is that the Vetements collective has a lot of pooled talent and experience to call upon. Idealistic as they are, they havent started as naive lambs to the slaughter of the industry. One core ally is the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova Adam, who walked last in the show. Other people have worked silently with them, moonlighting from jobs elsewhere. Demna Gvasalia himself learned the ropes at Maison Martin Margiela, before setting up Vetements and getting on with proving that there can be a different way of doing things. Apart from their stylistic insights into what people really want to wear, it feels like the beginning of something else, tooperhaps something like the power of niceness and friendship in an industry that could do with a lot more of that.$$Perhaps more than ever, tonights VFiles show pushed fashion decency to its very limit, then went further. In front of an adoring, rambunctious crowd of colorfully attired demimonde-dwellers bobbing to dubstep, courtesy of DJ A-Trak, not to mention all who watched on Periscope and tweeted furiously, five young designers or collectives took the runway with abandon. They were the chosen ones, as selected online by an international voting public. Were breaking stereotypes, said founder Julie-Anne Quay backstage. These brave kids, who are 22 and under, represent the next generation of tastemakers, the new youth culture. The most compelling of the bunch, conceptually speaking, was Feng Chen Wang. Born in Beijing and fresh out of fashion college in Britain, she described the very somber basis for her collection, learning of her fathers cancer diagnosis last year and taking a deep interest in the process of recovery, even observing the surgery firsthand in the operating room. As bleak as it sounds, and rather contrary to her chirpy demeanor, she made the most of the bad situation, crafting clothes bursting with outsized organ shapes and zippers evoking incisions. Some models wore blood bags that dripped a black liquid (not blood) into plastic tubes spelling out the words Love and Life. David Ferreira, based in London, brought together his favorite film, Orlando, and Empress Dowager Cixi of nineteenth-century China. As it happened, some of the pieces ended up looking remarkably similar to Rihannas yellow stunner, by Guo Pei, at this years Met Gala. (Incidentally, Rihanna has sported previous VFiles designers to various events.) Ferreira said he combined elements of European couture with historical Chinese dress. He mentioned foot-binding, but it was surely only coincidence that one model tumbled twice, ripping off her shoes each time and continuing barefoot to thunderous applause.  Design duo Namilia (Nan Li and Emilia Pfohl) sent out elaborate inflatables spanning the entire width of the runway and covered in naughty words and symbolsall highly unwearable, to be sure, but also very entertaining and well received. Backstage they cited the power of Instagram and the rebellious spirit of todays pop stars. The New York trio Moses Gauntlett Cheng was the most trans-centric of the group, mixing and matching assorted genders and identities that, along with a self-assured sashay, recalled the 80s drag balls from the film Paris Is Burning. Japanese designerand graduate of both Central Saint Martins and ParsonsKozaburo Akasaka also sought inspiration from an earlier decade, but his was conjured from the other side of the planet, Tokyo. His pieces were hand-stitched and patched together from scraps of denim, leather, and other assorted tatters, complete with cowboy boots. One imagines his post-apocalyptic, Wild West vision was all the rage in his hometown at the end of the last millennium. When the grand finale took placea parade of all the models in all the looksthe effect was nothing short of Fellini-esque. And get this: Most of it either already is or will soon be available to buy online. It really is a new day.$$However I touch things, they always look very polished. I just cant help it. So noted comeback kid Victor Alfaro after his show today, and indeed, the collection he presented proved his point. The greatest part of the appeal of these clothes was their immaculateness, discovered in the perfect body-skimming fit of a bias-cut silk gown or the piping detail on a white cotton jumpsuit or, of course, in any of Alfaros signature knits. Of the latter, the most eye-catching pieces were the dressy sweaters embellished with ribbon embroidery or dangling bugle beads, or patchworked together with lace; the items that stuck with you, however, were the ones that summoned a more monumental effect. Alfaro has a talent for the statuesque, which he deployed here in (seemingly) simple silk gowns with graphic windowpane insets, terrific long-line jumpsuits and likewise lean cashmere gilets, and various voluminous pants. Tee-shaped dresses and quilted cargo pants introduced a sportier tone, but they still had a certain Georgia OKeeffe-wandering-the-New-Mexico-desert vibe, one that was ramified by garments such as a floor-length knit cape. (Ellsworth Kelly, meanwhile, provided the punch of yellow and orange in the collections palette.) The aura of self-possession in Alfaros clothes will, alongside his knits, remake his name in timethis 90s wunderkind seems to be taking the long view and making clothes not so much for this, or any particular, moment, but ones built to last.$$Im a sponge. That might seem a very odd, existential quote to come from the mouth of the distinctly un-blob-like Victoria Beckham, but she was using it as a figure of speech to account for the design ideas she put into her Spring collectionfeelings she says she just picked up in passing on her nonstop travels with work and family. Ive lived in L.A., we have the show here in New York, and now obviously were back in London, she said backstage, so I guess Ive figured it out from that. There are subliminal things in here, like the surf prints, but this collection is more about attitude and just making things fresh and carefree. Perhaps the best way to judge Beckhams fluid, just-above-the-ankle midi lengths, swing dresses, and flats is to compare them to what she was producing at the very beginning of her career as a designer, i.e., fitted hourglass silhouettes, tiny short dresses, and eveningwear, all with towering heels. That is now firmly a thing of the past. There was nothing on the runway that looked even remotely cocktail or red carpet in the old sense, but times have changed. Where there once might have been sculpted, corseted bustiers, now there is crinkled duchesse satin suspended from gathered necklines, and where once there had been stiletto platforms, here were backless loafers. The distance traveled can definitely be measured in a much more grown-up idea of what sophisticated fashion is to the kind of women who inhabit, or would like to move into, Victoria Beckhams world. The clothes read as expensive, with a luxurious, creamy heft and swish about them, exuding a wealthy confidence that says, I have achieved the perfect life, but I dont need to try too hard to show that off to you.$$With her second flagship store set to open its doors in Hong Kong, Victoria Beckham finds herself at the helm of a brand thats an increasingly global proposition. Still, after hosting a dinner for London Fashion Week (and a quick call to check in on her kids) she found time to walk through the Spring 2016 offerings from her little sister line, Victoria, Victoria Beckham. It started when we were in Marrakech for Davids birthday, she said of the springboard for this season. We visited the Jardin Majorelle, and I was really inspired by all the tiles and the color. This theme was most pronounced in the signature Majorelle Blue bloom prints that had the edifying effect of Matisses cutouts. These folksy florals were reworked more delicately in off-white lace on a simple crepe shift and a neat macram sweater. A laser-cut dress in intense orange delivered a kaleidoscopic kick, with a level of detailing that had a mainline finish. The silhouette was largely loose and relaxed, with voluminous-backed cape dresses that chimed with the brands playful, modern tone. Ive been wearing this huge gray dress all around New York, said Beckham of the starting point for these billowing shapes. It felt so summery and light. It made me realize that wearing volume really can be flattering. Merging VVB with her denim line last season has apparently brought out Beckhams experimental side. Weve pushed the denim with more techniques, cuts, and washes, she said, pointing to a pair of eyelet-flecked white tapered jeans. Among these new shapes were some frayed-hem culottes, complete with a belt, that are sure to be on summer wish lists. Happily, there was still space in the collection for her best-selling flares and skinnys.  The real draw here for VVBs younger customer is in the expanded presence of entry-level pieces. A delicious series of T-shirts, some contenders for eveningwear, echoed the primary palette with leather or fuzzy-felt finish flowers. Im excited about the T-shirts, said the designer, eyeing a white tee with contrast black collar in an oversize pop print. Theyre a chance to reach out to people of varying budgets. I want all women to be able to experience the brand.$$A collection starring crochet and pleated slacks might intimidate all but the most intrepid fashion enthusiast (retailers included). But leave it to Russian designer Vika Gazinskaya to turn challenging ideas into charming clothes. She did this by stripping away the corresponding clichs: Her Spring outing was neither stuck in the 80s nor weighed down with craft. Rather, she relied on brushed cotton and crisp silk as her two blank slates from which to experiment with volume, color, and the placement of colorful appliqus, some backed with functioning pockets. Its just too bad that the collection is handicapped by photos that flatten the dimension of her ample silhouettes and fail to capture the humble appeal of the crochet (the flower placket and two-tone scalloped hem among the standouts). Photos also dont do justice to the rigor of Gazinskayas constructionthose sculpturally fronted tops and feminine trenches do not assume their shapes by accident. Fortunately, she has a sixth styling sense, aware that pairing the trousers with an embellished T-shirt or silk camisole is as important at entry level (price and aesthetic) as the crochet bib over the folksy dress is at the advanced. Gazinskaya remains her own most convincing muse, so it will be interesting to see how soon she wears Look 6, with its odd color pairing of chocolate and peanut butter. In the meantime, toward the end of the walk-through, she lifted up a full skirt to expose a crinoline. Also under there: her enduring joie de vivre.$$Adventuress is a deliciously double-edged title that was used in 19th- and early-20th-century England to describe invariably hot women who were outside the bounds of society and apparently set on their insertion into it. From the niggles, titters, and whispers that Goga Ashkenazithe commodities-pumped proprietor of Vionnetsometimes attracts, one suspects that a century ago she would have been labeled an adventuress. Today, though, it seems like what it is: snobbery, pure and simple.  Ashkenazis project at Vionnet is sincere if sometimes touched by naivety. Today, fueled by the insertion of Hussein Chalayan into her team, she presented a collection that convincingly tipped its hat to Madame Vionnet herselfcheck Pinterest, yallplus incorporated Vionnets own classical source code. Beneath the breathy wind of mood-board romanticismspanning from Peter Doigs canoe paintings to Byrons She Walks in Beautythis collection was at its essence a group of bias-cut shades-of-nude column dresses with flanks of pliss and sometimes iffy paneling, jazzed up with odd handmaiden flying buttresses, weighed down by sewn-in stones. There were unfortunate diversions: A sheer paneled black dress featured a crisscross of relief cutely taken from an upskirt photograph of the Eiffel Tower, but it was still a too-sheer black dress. But the sublimations of Doric relief and go-to nymph adornment onto half-caped trouser suits with sneaker-meets-gladiator sandals represented the whisper of a Platonically touched ideal spanning then and now. Titter ye not: Vionnet is okay.$$Its always a head-spinning experience to go through a new Visvim collection with its designer, Hiroki Nakamura. Not only are his collections sprawling, encompassing mens as well as a newer womens line (WMV), but most pieces have unusual and distinct origins that beg to be told and heard. And Nakamura, a gifted raconteur, is more than happy to share their stories. Essentially, Visvim begins and ends with vintage fabric. But heres the thing: Nothing is actually vintage. Rather, each piece is created anew in the spirit of vintage, usually the result of a long and international chain of artisanal workmanship. Nakamura described how, for example, one sweater began as organic Italian cotton, which was then hand-knitted in Peru before being finished in France. There were also mens shoes woven out of bits of raffia in Morocco, but which, because the craftsmen there werent experienced with a particular shade of blue, required a team of Japanese dye specialists to assist. Dyeing is otherwise done in Japan, as a rule, as in a series of lightweight cotton dresses with an all-over checkerboard pattern made by brushing dye over rice resin in a technique called katazome. That innocuous-looking plaid suit jacket? Its made entirely out of paper pulp, for extra breathability. Aside from his obsession with vintage fabrics, Nakamura is also a collector of found objects or flea-market finds, things he picks up on his travels and packs into the five or six suitcases he says he takes with him on every trip. He assembled a display of these items for the showing today: a jar of shells he found on a beach in Montauk that he drew as a shell print for the collection; a parasol from Alsace that inspired him to make an indigo-dyed umbrella; a jewelry box from the 1900s that he liked for its brass studs; Geta slippers whose once-bright velvet faded long ago. On the topic of shoesupon which the company was founded and which still whip up enormous cult-like zealsome important news: first, a new sneaker style called the Roland Jogger is launching, and second, the famed FBT moccasin that started it all now comes with a protective leather overlay, by popular demand.$$Vivienne Tam built her business on lavish evening gowns that fuse her Chinese heritage with modern technology, but todays show threw a wrench in that formula. Spring was all about casual, streetwise clothes for both girls and guys; it was Tams first time casting male models in her show. Traveling between New York, Hong Kong, and Paris, I noticed people on the streets were very androgynous, Tam explained before the show. Girls were wearing mens clothes, and men were wearing more feminine things. Sure, you could chalk it up to the impact Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic, and (most famously) Caitlyn Jenner have had on pop culture this year. But transgender isnt a trend, and Tam included lots of additional context, too, like the oft-referenced Chinese Art Deco period, which saw women playing with masculine style for the first time.  The show opened with a relaxed, strapless gray striped ensemble that captured Tams new laid-back approach. It was closely followed by a few different takes on shirting, like a flouncy wrap dress and a mens charcoal jumpsuit with a ruffle down the front. A lot of the best pieces, however, were the ones that could pass for unisex, like the satin souvenir jacketsalready a big trend for falland tech-mesh bombers. For the red carpet, Tam showed playful mahjong-inspired dresses that were undeniably fun; the game was introduced in the U.S. during the Art Deco period. Intricate dresses with embroidered rows of tiles felt whimsical, but still a lot more restrained than the gilded, heavily embellished dresses Tam showed in the past.$$Can you reasonably rage against the machine when you are a highly profitable cog in it? This is an obvious paradox inherent in Dame Vivienne Westwoods policy of using her shows as a podium from which to preach about the iniquities of mass consumerism and fossil fuel dependence. Her valiant pitch at squaring that circle is the exhortation to buy less things that are better made and last longer, a sentiment that, while impossible to disagree with, doesnt quite carry when delivered in the backstage hubbub immediately before a show of seasonal fashion. Nonetheless, this evenings Vivienne Westwood Red Label carnival was a corker. Held in a basement space grippingly advertised outside as an Alien Sex Club, the runway was overlooked by a balcony on which gathered a band of paper-crowned model/protestors holding banners hostile to politicians and shale gas extraction. The soundtrack was, quite frankly, hellisha cacophony of sirens and garble through which occasionally stirring dialogue could be heard, including the weary line: Fashion is ridiculous, a pathetic parody of what it used to be. After the last look walked, the protesters descended behind Westwood. Everyone in the room dutifully took pictures, then realized they had no signal. The most piquant contradiction in this show was how incompatible the collection seemed with the rhetoric around it. Because while the styling was absolutely maverickall smeared robber-mask eyes and sleep-in-a-tree hairthere is no other way to describe the clothes than with the C-word: conservative. Prettily ruched frocksfrocks!in lace came layered with sweet scarlet florals. Knee-length tea dresses were delicately cut and spattered with Marimekko-touched patterns. Layered embroideries in manor-house interior reliefs were layered around their wearers like professionally piped icing. Yes, there was the odd proselytizing button or T-shirt emblazoned with a meaningful carbon footprint, but subtract theseand perhaps alter some of the more laissez-bare necklinesand you could imagine the Duchess of Cambridge or Samantha Cameron appropriately shaking hands with the CEO of Shell in a great many of these looks. It was as if the Sex Pistols were covering Maroon 5and it was good.$$Vivienne Westwood has made a habit of using her fashion shows as a platform for activism. This season, she was championing two related causes. In a note left for attendees at their seats, she invited them to join her at the Peoples March for Climate, Justice and Jobs in London on November 29, just ahead of the start of the Paris climate talks. On the runway, meanwhile, she paid homage to Venice, a city that, perhaps due to climate change, is sinking even faster than it was before. Venice is a good theme for Westwoodher shows tend to have a certain carnival atmosphere in their mix of the decadent and the louche. Youd have expected a Vivienne Westwood Save Venice! collection to feature quite a few of her signature evening dresses, with their bouffant skirts and baroque swirls of sculptural draping. But Westwood took another tack. Instead of cocktail looks, she emphasized rather plainspoken daywear silhouettes, shown on male as well as female models, in a gesture that read less political than as an homage to the Venetian tradition of the masque. The cross-dressing theme was echoed as well in the array of tailored items, in particular suits that looked oversize and mannish, with trousers cut to appear as though theyd been cinched up spontaneously to fit a womans smaller frame. That was one of Westwoods dramatic flourishes; others included poufed sleeves and hardware and crystal embellishment sewn onto jackets. As far as theatrics went, however, Westwood saved her fire for a few spectacular pieces, such as the extra-long coats worn high overhead, which created a spookily huge silhouette, and a bodysuit of sequin-dripping net that conjured a very fancy birdcage. Needless to say, those looks had quite an impact on the runway. But the strongest ones at todays show were much more straightforwardWestwood still drapes a mean dress, and her fluid silk frocks, bunched artfully in the front, made for a fine addition to her substantial oeuvre. They were dressy, those dresses, but had such a casual mien that you could imagine wearing one to march alongside the designer in London next month.$$Are you a good witch or a bad witch? And furthermore, who cares about that old adage when Wendy Nichol keeps making clothes that so neatly and lushly encompass both? For Spring, the accessories-maven-cum-cult-ready-to-wear-favorite has struck on her most winning balance since debuting her clothes back in 2011. If threads of Victoriana once were a chief characteristic of her offerings, then recent seasons have seen the scales tip toward a more general, more languid sort of loveliness. Even the pieces marked most starkly by a sense of drama were easy to envision as appealing to many different types of bewitching women. Nichols floor-grazing collarless duster, for example, is beloved by everyone from Beyonc to Saudi princesses, and here came in a lustrous, shadow-striped ivory silk, with a leather tasseled belt. Elsewhere, a showstopping Solstiss lace gown and generously fringed bustier in buttery black leather looked like you might just run the world in them. Still, not all of us clock in as royalty of one sort or another on the day-to-day, so Nichol has savvily begun rounding out her offerings with more traditionally wearable separates. See a pair of wide-leg pants, complete with a wafting overlay of chiffon, or a cropped tank top and tee. The designers impeccable fabrications, all whipped up in her New York studio, lend even those simplest of styles (including her utterly louche bias-cut skinny scarves) a feeling thats markedly special. Best was a softly pleated circle skirt in pieced-togethernot printedblack and white stripes. All inky at first glance, but take a step back and it flashed a snowy-white undersidea bit naughty, and very, very nice.$$Wes Gordon is one of a handful of young designers who have found themselves in a tricky position vis--vis their clientele. Gordon serves what once was known as an uptown customerexcept that those women are just as likely, these days, to be found downtown, or evenheavens to Betsyin Brooklyn, and their shifting sense of style reflects the change in geography. They want clothes that are luxurious and polished and feminine, and that will serve at the formal occasions they are called upon to attend, but they also want clothes that are functional and unfussy, with a dont-mess-with-me attitude and perhaps a hint of the offbeat. This is a difficult brief. Gordon, for his part, fulfilled it capably last season, finding ways to elevate a grungy vibe without losing track of its essential brooding spirit.   This time out, Gordon took a similar tack. The silhouettes were girlier and the palette less moody and imposingthis was a Spring collection, after allbut the grunge inflection remained firmly in place. Gordon noted that he had photos of ultimate slacker girl-crush Winona Ryder posted up all over his studio as he prepped this collectionand at moments, in looks like the silk or plaid cotton dresses with stripes of cobwebby lace sewn on in seemingly amateurish fashion, he did summon Ryders characteristic demure dishevelment. Elsewhere, the message was more muddled. There were great seam-detailed looks done in matter-of-fact charcoal linen, and need-it-now marled knits, which, when paired with the buttery calfskin pieces, provided the collection with much of its warmth. There were other nice touches, too, like the tunics with cutout shoulders, or the flourishes of iridescent chiffon. Overall, though, Gordons effort this season to fuse upscale and edge led him down too many byways, and the collection never really came into focus. It could have used fewer stories, better told.$$Colors and prints tend to have a short lifespan in the fashion cycle, so when they happen to be your signatures, keeping them fresh is key. One way Whit designer Whitney Pozgay manages to do that each season is by enlisting artists to collaborate on her prints, from New York artist Adam Handler to her own husband, Parker Argote, who has painted many of her signature motifs over the years. The final results are crafty and eclectic, not trendy or loud (read: no digital prints here). For Spring, Pozgay wanted to illustrate the contrast of hot air balloons over the African savannahan image packed with opposites like hard and soft, artificial and natural, old and new. Striking shades of poppy and lemon popped against ivory, sand, and black on straight midi skirts, boxy shift dresses, and off-the-shoulder blouses, many of which were stamped with a series of tribal prints. Each one was handmade, like the blocky, geometric print that was initially laid out with sport tape, or the sweet, slightly retro African lily print. We wanted to reappropriate the tribal theme in a more artful way, Pozgay explained. She tapped Handlerwho recently showed his work at the Fred Torres Galleryto paint a giraffe across the entire front of a crisp shirtdress.  Elsewhere, the idea of tribal clothing was subtler and, in some ways, already engrained in the Whit vernacular: Mixed prints, wrap details, and voluminous shapes are hallmarks of traditional African style, but theyre also the elements Pozgay always goes back to. Its all the things we love mashed together, she said. Its crisp and wearable, and there are plays on proportion, like bell sleeves with a skinny skirt, but its still forward and fun.$$Ruffian designers Brian Wolk and Claude Morais packed up the car for Los Angeles a year and a half ago, part of the wave of westward-leaning New Yorkers. Last night, they presented their second collection for their new eponymous label, Wolk Morais, in West Hollywood, and the show was a testament to how quickly theyve taken to their adopted home and put down roots. Elizabeth Stewart, who dresses Cate Blanchett, Amanda Seyfried, Julia Roberts, and other celebs, styled the show, and her teenaged kids and their friends not only modeled in it, but also inspired the clothes.  Back in New York City, Wolk and Morais used to be known for ladylike flounces and frills, and couture-level fabrications. Theyve rejiggered the formula at their new label, with raw denim, utility jumpsuits, and sweatshirts, and an occasional pair of tights for the guys who walked the show. This is the right move for them. Fashion is headed in a looser, less-fancy direction at the moment, for one, and for another, the raw denim looked really good, especially a jumper-dress worn over a silk blouse. Elsewhere, Wolk and Morais had fun with print, creating a digitized floral that turned up small and large on everything from those hoodie sweatshirts to cocktail numbers and event dresses. They didnt leave their dressy instincts entirely behind when they left New York. That makes sense, too. There are too many starlets and red carpets to count in their new hometown. With Stewart for a fairy godmother, as they call her, some of those up-and-coming actresses, and perhaps some very-well-established ones, too, could find their way into Wolk Moraiss frocks. From there, its not far into stores.$$The idea of the outsider looking in has always fascinated Yang Li, a designer whose rise to the upper echelons of Paris fashion came via Beijing; Perth, Australia; London; and Antwerp. Its surprising, then, to note that his Spring heroine isnt concerned with the divide of East versus West but rather a more fictive trip down memory lanethat of a punk in exile returning to her bourgeois past, prompted to scour her grandmothers closet and piece together a new identity. That romantic metamorphosis unfolded from the get-go, as Look 1 was comprised of a delicate jacquard bra top and an organza-trained cream trenchcoat that topped mannish pants and monk-strap derbies. It immediately engaged a sensual rub of mid-century prettiness with Lis codes of postpunk music, sharp tailoring, and tough, unfinished eveningwear. What followed was a repetitive expansion of that framework, as the designer riffed on generous pant volumes, fluid-sliced camisoles and polo tops, and the jarring grunge effect of silk gingham layered with leather coats or ball skirts cut in crimson inkblot florals. Though a trio of patchwork tailored coats recalled Lis time under Raf Simons in Antwerp, he twisted their familiarity with an artisanal touch, as bold lyrics by the neo-folk group Swans were traced in hand-stitched gothic calligraphy. Like an intuitive balancing act, their demure counterparts followed suitsack-back, bracelet-sleeved opera coats in duchesse satin or taffetacouture-like creations that held their own among the complexity of viscose trenchcoats or tailored boucl jackets peeling open with sinuous zips. Sprinkled throughout, the belts of those trenches were worn as fetishist buckle scarvesclasped at the neck with silver brooches picked out in studs and sprays of flora. They were the totems of youth and establishment, cast side by side with arresting, irreverent beauty.$$Kanye West only confirmed he was putting on a show last Saturday when his invitations went out, but save for his friend Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy presentation, Yeezy was the event of the week. Outside beforehand, camera phonewielding fans swarmed the VIP door, angling for a picture of Drake, Lorde, and Jaden Smith. Just as many people were trying to scoot past security without a ticket at the main entrance. Once inside, the setting was comparatively serene, but only until those celebrities and the designers familyKim, North, Khlo, Kourtney, and Kendallstarted to take their front row seats; from then on, it was pretty much pandemonium.  West worked with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft for the second season going. Like last time, street-cast models mixed with professional ones, and Kylie Jenner, the designers sister-in-law, put in a cameo. Unlike last time, West and Beecroft made the military metaphor literal, enlisting real drill sergeants who called out formations. Platinum-blond, fair-skinned models came first and marched to the end of the runway to pose for pictures. As the show progressed, the clothes shaded from beiges and taupes to browns and blacks, and the models hair and skin tone got darker, with the darkest models and clothing coming last. At the finale they arrayed themselves front to back, white to black. In a year in which racial injustice has occupied the headlines, it was a potent tableau, seemingly loaded with meaning. But if West was making a statement about inequality in America, he chose not to address it with this reporter. When asked about the casting, he said, Its just a painting, just using clothing as a canvas of proportion and color.   Were not sure if we buy that, but if West wants to put the focus on his fashion, not his politics, then well play along. The Yeezy vibe is a consistent one. Sweatshirts, leggings, outerwear, and boots remain the backbone of the collection. Its still monochrome head-to-toe, and its still essentially unisex. Spring does feel less shaggy than its predecessor, but its just as streetwise. If West makes good on his promise at the VMAs last month and does indeed run for President in 2020, hes going to have to get his campaign trail suits somewhere else.$$Math isnt one of the things you hear fashion editors talk about while they wait for runway shows to start. (Were right-brained people!) But Yeohlee Teng likes to think about numbers and geometry when she designs her clothes. At first glance, Tengs Spring collection was as simple as it getsall button-down shirts, scoop-neck T-shirt dresses, and pencil skirtsbut most pieces were designed with equations in mind. Pockets were placed in perfect 6-by-6-inch squares, and a spongy, bonded wool coat was cut from a giant circle. The models even stood on a 36-by-36-by-12-inch platform in the middle of her tucked-away 29th Street store.  Teng also considered how clothes fill up the negative space around the bodysee the rounded ecru coat with pouf sleeves, which concealed the models every curve, or the sheer filigree shirts, which seemed to take up no space at all. Of course, the average shopper likely wont consider those factors when she grabs a Yeohlee parka off the rack, but the emphasis on numbers and form did lend a sense of order to the designers sometimes vague aesthetic.$$Its about going from step to step, said Yigal Azroul of Spring, and showing that progression. What came of this transient mind-set was a collection that started with light (a transparent silk-twill dress with printed brushstrokes) and bowed with dramasee the all-black finale knockout with jabot lacing, neck to navel. Yet, despite the range, Azroul managed to keep his trademark cool by making sure his silhouettes never veered too far afield; these clothes all have appeal, and widespread at that. The best piece here was a motorcycle jacket that fell somewhere in the middle of Azrouls evolutionary story, its body rendered in thick, architectural leather, and its sleeves spun of misty chiffon embroidered with sprigs and ferns. Smart and effortless, with a spin. Later, Azroul tried colorful floral appliqus over jet lace, but he was strongest when keeping the concept simpler: A black-and-white guipure turtleneck turned heads, and any number of PYTs might find wardrobe bliss in a little dove-gray jacket and steely filigree dress. The teal and black dresses were also eye-catchingAzroul mentioned he could see Gwyneth Paltrow wearing one. (Agreed.) With a clean, matte beauty look (slicked-backed ponies and the faintest breath of blush), this was a pleasant evolution, indeed.$$To witness a Yohji Yamamoto creation make its way down the runway is to wonder whether he arrived at it by accident or by deliberate design. Likewise the show itself, which today took place in the gloriously gilded gallery at City Hall, where the acoustics amplified the silence between what may or may not have been a live music performance. Turns out, Yamamoto supplied the recording, a one-man-jam that consisted of him singing Come into the shadows.  Backstage, he confirmed that the improvisational styling of the wrapped, knotted, and displaced looks that set the shows tone was very much on purpose. Each time you wear, its different, he explained. The clothes were also different in that he wasnt suffocating the models with an impenetrable concept. Gradually, however, he switched into a higher, historical gear; hoop skirts seemed like theyd survived a tornado, and excess fabric spilled out from the tops of corsets. The denim tubes assembled into a skirt were Yamamotos interpretation of an 18th century crinoline that he found in a rare book on European lingerie. Only someone capable of reading Yamamotos mind would have connected the dots between these exquisitely tattered looks, the makeshift parasols and the all-terrain Adidas sneaker boots to arrive at his stance on climate change. Earth is angry, the summer is too hot and the rain becomes a storm. And in hot times, we need underwear in the streets, he said. Environmental message aside, the cumulative effect was a collection that skewed cool. This, Yamamoto declared, was also intentional: My brand needs young customers. At midnight, he will turn 72 years young, which likely explains the invitation boasting a photo of his aging hands. The girl who closed the show wearing a stiffly ruffled, roughed-up dress in fire engine red was equipped with a camera as part of a documentary being made about the designer. Yamamoto bearing all seems unimaginable: he communicates via rogue corset boning, randomly painted pantaloons and shapeless shrouds. But then this momenta genuine resurgencewont last forever.$$Its been a big week for Zac Posen. First came his diffusion line presentation, which featured an LED dress he made in partnership with Google. After that, his debut collection for Brooks Brothers. Tonight, in front of Amy Schumer, Christina Hendricks, Jennifer Hudson, and Bella Thorne, he took over Grand Centrals Vanderbilt Hall with a signature collection that was surprisingly free of many of his signatures. Beforehand, Posen said, Its important for us to keep it exciting. Weve had so much red carpet, it got to the point that I wanted to give a proposition for my friends and customers during the day. Enter a black cotton sundress that, paired with Christian Louboutin skimmers and a top-handle bag, conjured St.-Tropez in the 60s. It was positively breezy, and while the clothes didnt remain quite that low-key, when he inevitably turned his eye to evening, Posen approached it in a new way. Without any of the engineered, hourglass seaming hes famous for, his long dresses had a more relaxed sensibility. For surface interest, he tacked floating seams with bugle beads. One hundred percent harder than sewing a normal seam, he said, fingering a tuxedo that featured the couture technique.  A guipure lace dress with a stiff yoke that extended a couple of inches above the models shoulders failed to evoke the ease Posen was after, and at the other end of the spectrum, a hand-crocheted top and skirt looked too crafty. But missteps aside, Posen did a commendable job here of extrapolating on his strengths and growing his repertoire. A special shout-out for a staple seam camisole and matching pants. It may not be fancy enough for the Emmys, but one of those ladies should snap up the outfit for an after-party.$$Zac Posen, like so many, has Cali on the brain. The states beachy joie de vivre and the active lifestyle its residents are known for were the designers jumping-off points this season for his little sister brand ZAC Zac Posen. Those notions came through in pieces like sportif dresses with aerodynamic-looking cutouts or a black shorts set, which was kitted out with a peplum in honeycomb mesh. Mismatched leopard-and-palm suiting had a whiff of the Venice boardwalk about it (albeit through the designers urbane lens), while he pointed to a maxi with a frond print as being particularly Coachella-ready. It was, in an elevated way, and this reference seemed telling in a collection that was both a little sweeter and a little younger than some of Posens recent offerings. Case in point: separates in candy-colored stripes and a bubble-hem raincoat. Elsewhere, there was a standout seventies-inspired swingy pink top trimmed in marabou felt ready-made for flouncing onto chaise longues or swanning about poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Posen wouldnt have been wrong if he had injected a bit of that same drama into some of his other daywear, but the evening options here were breezier than ever. A pink satin trapeze gown and another in pale aqua with tie-neck detailing were both easy and elegant. With results like these, wed say some California dreaming suits Posen just fine.$$For Spring, Zadig & Voltaires creative director, Cecilia Bnstrm, did not attempt to do new, just to do better. Its the type of corporate soul-searching approach that a brand is wise to consider after dabbling in various directions, unsure which one will stick. There was a laundry list of familiar Zadig & Voltaire items on view in the subterranean showroom today: fringed suede, breezy white cotton dresses, alt-cowboy motifs, embroidered denim, and a crocheted sweater shrug in alpaca. Masculine and feminine codes seesawed within single items (biker boots with lace laces), and lingerie pieces crossed over from night to day without constraint.  Without a doubt, the hero piece this season was the return of the leather dungarees, an early brand best seller. This latest iteration is being offered as a supple lambskin skirt, and the internal team should be prepared to run production on this every season. For now, though, Bnstrm indicated how the girl who ties an army shirt around the waist of her gold-flecked handkerchief dress embodied the brands unwavering homage to rock chicks, whether in Paris or halfway around the world. The candy-color suitcall it Haribo Tagada pinkmay have been the outlier among a largely neutral offering. Then again, the logo T-shirts consisted of three inspirational words: Happy, Peace, and Love. And for the time being, though not indefinitely, that would be inspiration enough.$$How to make it new again. That, to make a long story short, is the designers conundrum. Maria Cornejo was feeling it particularly acutely this season, with a whole new team in her studio. But rather than stick to old formulasthatd be the easy thing to doshe opted to shake them up. Backstage she reported that all of the fabrics were developed in house. Its all exclusive, but its a lot of work, she said. Work that paid off.  In recent years, Cornejo has leaned heavily on prints. They havent failed her yet, but this season she had only one, an oversize brushstroke motif that brightened up a trio of dresses and a pajama set. Here, more often that not, she was experimenting with rich texture, from the cubic weave (looks just like it sounds) of a white sundress with wide grosgrain straps, to the fringy fil coup of a tunic worn over pants, to the pliss leather of an off-the-shoulder top and matching skirt. Pleats: Huge in 2016.  Cornejos research into material culminated in a dress and coat in black-on-white cubist embroidery, the graphic, gridded precision of which was atypical of the designer, who tends to favor curves over hard edges. It wasnt just her fabrics that got a rethink, either. The long, almost to-the-ankles silhouette was new for her too. Shes particularly keen on the swagger of below-the-knee coats and coat vests. Once more, Cornejo worked with Bolivian artisans on hand-knits. A white sweater that slouched sexily off the shoulders looked like a bona fide hit.$$Down Under, theres a book, published in 1894, called Seven Little Australians. Its about a family of seven children, and all of the rebelling that ensues. They wreaked havoc on [their father] . . . back then, everything was very stitched up, says Nicky Zimmermann (an Aussie herself, who codesigns with sister Simone). Such bad behaviorespecially in an era of strictnesscaptured her attention for Zimmermanns Spring lineup. Very mischievous, the designer said. I love the idea of an underlying naughtiness with these classic fabrications. The 1800s came through in elements like high collars and lace sleeves, but the sly insouciance was what captured interest: Somehow, these frilly things, like a dusty pink bib-flounce top with an ivory lattice skirt or a tiered cobalt dress with noir pearling, felt plausible for a weekend outing in modern-day Sydney. Call it Victoriana for the Bondi Beach set. And if at times it felt like a lot, in terms of texture and ornateness, one look at the crowd confirmed that with this brand, more is more, and, in fact, eminently wearablethere were plenty of Zimmermann flounces and filigrees throughout the room. To that, this brand retains two steadfast strengths: One, the clothes are always well made. But two, those clothes are often chameleonic between formal and easyand the theme this season synced nicely with this equation. So why not wear bell sleeves to the Bondi Icebergs? Be one of those naughty Australians.$$Water, water, everywhere, / nor any drop to drink. Those lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner sprang instantly to mind upon encountering Zo Jordans new ocean-theme collection. She hit her water concept hard, evoking the sea in everything from the fishermans knots on the sleeves of cashmere-blend sweaters to wave-printed neoprene to tailored pieces as glittery as ocean phosphorescence. All of which could have read as a bit on the nose, except that Jordan put together a nicely varied wardrobe herethere was a good range to her easy-to-wear silhouettes. The easy-to-wear thing is important: The designer has a knack for making un-precious clothes, whether a pair of slouchy cropped trousers or an anorak in tonal camouflage jacquard, and shes canny about using her materials to give those utilitarian shapes a sense of elevation. What she hasnt quite managed to do yet is stamp her label with a strong identitythough the women who will be snapping up Jordans terrific, well-priced knits wont likely feel the need to complain about that. She seems to be narrowing in on a signature look. This season, though, the Zo Jordanness of Zo Jordan remained slightly out of focus.$$From a new Paris showroom, Zuhair Murad came across as particularly buoyant. He showed off pictures of his delicate, lacy designs for the New York City Ballet dancers and revealed that he will be designing J.Los wardrobe for her gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, his starting point for Spring was sailor sensuality, which, despite the campy coupling, offered a sea of opportunity to expand on his strengths. Daywear largely consisted of nautical elements, from marinire dresses in mixed-gauge knits to wide-leg sailor pants. Sensitive to his clients lifestyles, he steered the theme away from fisherman and toward yacht-level luxestandouts included the crisp, white double-breasted captains suit and chic separates resembling naval pennants in satiny scuba material. If the plunging-V, shorter-than-short jumpsuit in striped sequins went overboard on cheek, its exactly the type of piece that could prompt a celeb stylist tug-of-war. But the cheek continued with lipstick lips planted in jacquard, embroidery, and more sequins. In each port, the women are leaving kisses, mused Murad, who pointed out that even the monochromatic knits featured lip motifs embedded into the mesh. A coral-floral patterning reverted back to his predictable mix of sheer and sparkle. Yet the look that outshone all the others was not the least bit glitz; instead, the satin scuba had been transformed into a solid red gown, its elongated top trussed with thick grosgrain. Lets call it five-alarm siren.$$Fashion and Instagram are such (often saccharine) bedfellows because they are both platforms whose participants are preset for positive affirmation. Yet even the most cynical London showgoers are stirred by the sense that Paula Gerbases 1205 is potentially something rather special. To truly understand her womens clothes you need to briefly to think about menswear. For several years Gerbase was head designer at Kilgour (the Savile Row tailoring house), which is headed up by Carlo Brandelli, a compellingly intense chap whose preoccupation is the reduction of the classic masculine suit into its sublimated, sculptural essence. This is the touchstone upon which the super-serious Gerbase has sparked her own trajectory.  Todays collection, she said, was partially informed by a holiday trek through the Atlas Mountains, but thatpah!was just spiel. Really what she was doing was whittling down shapes and concepts into a pragmatic-ish conceptual skeleton. So we saw carefully slouchy nappa shirts and paneled trousers; neutral nonsymmetric knits slung like minimalists' bandoliers and jackets woven of paper with corsetry inserts. The color palette was deliciously dull. Pliss, both in nylon and silk, served as the scrunchy subtext against which Gerbases Puritan withdrawal was expressed. And all this came underlined by cultishly unsullied all-white Nike Air Max 90s. For forensic under-the-radar neutrality, in London, 1205 is the label to turn to.$$Let other New York City fashion designers toast the 10th anniversary of their brand by getting down and dirty. Phillip Lim celebrated a decade of 3.1 with plain old dirt. Mounds of the stuff were installed all around Lims catwalk this afternoon, in an arrangement designed by architect Maya Lin. As Lim revealed after the show, the dirt was in fact compost that he and his team had been making from their own food waste and storing up for months. I was thinking, he said, about where things start. They start from a seed. They start from dirt. The compost mounds on the runway, which would be de-installed post-show and delivered to local parks, thus symbolized both beginnings and rebirth. It was a fitting theme for this show, which found Lim reprising various signatures but arranging them in a way that felt new. This collection boasted a directness that some of Lims recent outings have lackedhis modus operandi here was, put simply, to take sporty and/or mannish looks and infuse them with a sense of romance. That strategy was apparent in the most instantly appealing of the looks he showed today, pinstriped pieces billowing with ruffles or collaged with floral prints. But it was evidenced, as well, in the likewise ruffled scuba tops, and the bomber jackets done in organza, satin, or silk. This show could have been a touch more concise. Lim had several strong ideas going here, like the fluid paper-bag waist trousers and the taut sweaters and dresses in burlap nylon that seemed to degrade into floral metallic jacquard, and he elevated the collection as a whole by focusing on its sense of hand, whether in the luxe green gazar used in a matching bandeau and high-slit skirt, or the delicate floral appliqu embellishing otherwise straightforward tops. But there was some clutter, too. The cargo pants and adapted biker jackets could have stayed in the showroom, for instance. Those pieces werent bad; they just diluted the poetry of the show as a whole. Lim has made it this farthere will be plenty of time to show biker jackets in the 10 years ahead.$$Flower power? Yep, the power to make a convert of avowed industry tomboy Stella Ishii. This season, the 6397 founder and her team began with flora in many a form, from their signature, supersoft pima graphic tees (one in fact read Flower Power, another was printed all over with different varietals) to a rose-pattern burnout tank. From there on out, though, it was 6397 business as usual: a strong lineup of the killer basics that have made the brand a staunch favorite of industry types. One of those staple pieces, however, went notably missing here: the mechanic suit, as seen on Bey, Heidi Klum, et al. After seasons in the range, Ishii and co. are giving the style a break, introducing instead a short-sleeved jumpsuit with patch pockets on the chest, a higher waistline, and a breezy zip front. Likewise, 6397 has proposed pajama dressing in various forms from the get-go; that trends newfound legs should make their silky black set, worn together or separately, a big hit. And hungry denimheads, take heart! After a couple of seasons of focusing on ready-to-wear, the label is back with remnant denim skirts, and not one, but two new jean shapes: the lightweight, low-slung Loose Capri, and the Tommy, a pitch-perfect wide-leg.\n"

      "Detachment was the word of the day at A Dtacher (yes like the labels name bien sr) Designer Mona Kowalska loves the high concept and one imagines that today detachment included being unconcerned with the gaze of others Kowalskas woman both as she appears on the runway and the real world dresses for herself Her intensely arty bend and taste for clothes that match it make A Dtacher a cultishly beloved brand among certain shoppers This season Kowalska presented them with a lineup of relatively playful offerings The collection opened with a pair of midi dresses in an Indonesian-inspired floral print which reemerged later imagined with allover Pop white polka dots Elsewhere came cardigans in an uncanny kind of amoxicillin pink that you imagined the A Dtacher woman wearing with tongue firmly in cheek (they had Kawakubo-esque allover holes to boot) The popcorn knits were pretty fun too The choice to use hardier materials lent dresses eccentric volumes but also led to a lineup that often felt frumpy albeit fashionably so At times the clothes lacked the excitement and want-it-now appeal of Kowalskas Spring collection a year ago Still when you looked around the room at todays show and spotted women from all walks of life wearing A Dtacher clothes from various seasons gone by you could be sure theyd find plenty to like here too$$You heard this collection coming long before you saw it a gutsy roar that grew to a crescendo as the models rode around the block from backstage into the courtyard of the Facult de Mdecine Paris Descartes They were riding pillion on a 25-strong lineup of muscle bikesHarleys and Triumphs This was because as An Vandevorst explained pre-show Its a road trip by a woman who lives in the East and has traveled to the West Hence the mirrored Indian beading of lean biker-touched separates and fabulous goth-influenced saris and the silver-shot Chinese brocade on cheongsam-biker hybrids None of these souvenir details was especially literal a studded textured and collarless burgundy jacket looked Chanel-meets-Mongolia (via Antwerp) and made a fine cupola to the elaborately tented blue pliss skirt below Vandevorst

aluminum shot through the fabrics Also starring here was a pedal-to-the-metal judo suit Crocheted face masks with sequined lips were de-sinisterized balaclavas and the footwear naturally was all biker bootsalthough sometimes it featured high heels Road signs were enlarged and broken up into the print used on one long flowing coat worn tied around the waist by its sleevesand once the show was done the bikers outside willfully ignored local traffic regulations and roared off en masse One of them broke down but that was the only glitch in this delightful little riot of a collection$$August saw the announcement of big news for ALC a long time in the works a majority investor in the form of new kid on the block InterLuxe (Jason Wu marks their only other fashion interest to date) And still despite this key development in the labels business designer Andrea Lieberman has gone and turned out one of her most intensely personal collections to date Inspired by a Berber textile she had picked up in her travels and stashed away in a box at her fathers home she let a certain nomadic romanticism guide her hand for Spring to an effect that was soulful and punk at the same time as Lieberman dubbed it A knack for winning and inventive distillations of the 70s and 90s has distinguished ALC for a while now here that came through in spades without so much as a trace of the costumey (the most literal retro indulgences were a great studded jacket in whiskey-color suede and crocheted maxi numbers) Instead Lieberman whipped up fantastic chevron knit gowns and strapless belted maxi dresses  The prints here also stood out as perhaps the labels strongest to date quietly folky-looking pink and chocolate blooms on a black background inspired by a henna-treated ceremonial veil the fantastic simple white tone-on-tone cotton jacquard influenced by a headdress and seen in a matching jacket and A-line skirt and a muted yet lush-looking take on tie-dye  In discussing the lineup Lieberman said she was particularly interested in creating a sense of restraint with these clothes That was here of course and the spare elegance of ALC continues to distinguish it from so many of its peers in the contemporary market but what really spoke most clearly in this collection was a feeling of general offhanded richness It was plenty to whet your palate for the big developments in both retail and wholesale on the horizon for the brand$$They call me the king of basics Jean Touitou said with a laugh at the APC presentation today Kingliness is one thing but the basics bit has lately proved irksome to Touitou He decided to do something about it this season starting by making a capsule offering of little black dresses Its an item whose APC time has come Past due even There are few things more essential to a French womans wardrobe than an LBD after all Touitou used black silk crepe a first for him he admitted but he insisted the silhouettes remain quite simple ensuring they stayed close to the spirit of the brand A long tube dress was cut on the bias so it glided over the body without gripping it and the excess material on a shorter one became a cape-like sash to wear loose behind the back or wrapped around the shoulders A third one cut on the grain and featuring a single leather shoulder strap was a favorite of the editors passing through the companys Rue Madame headquarters  Amidst the boy-cut denim pieces the overalls the smocks and the well-cut trench that rounded out the collection the other news was a shoulder bag made from molded vegetable-dyed leather It had a great saddlebag shape but the novelty wasnt how it looked or what it felt like it was in the fact that it will be available for sale right away not months from now Despite inroads by a few brands fashion seems stubbornly resistant to the see now/buy now concept and the missed opportunities just keep multiplying Good on Touitou and team APC for figuring this project out$$Natalia Alaverdian is a designer with a lot of ideas Good ones Her latest AWAKE collection threaded references to her spirit animal for this season the zebra through a rich variety of motifs ranging from dream-of-Africa aesthetics to ones cribbed from Vermeers Holland and 80s-era fashion from Japan not to mention a dollop of 90s grungy-ness Alaverdian hopped along from one association to another racking them up on top of each other in a way redolent of those corporate brainstorm meetings where every notion no matter how distant from the topic at hand gets added nonjudgmentally to the dry-erase board Alaverdian is at the point in her career as a designer where she should be able to refine her stew of ideas into an easily comprehensible proposition rather than continuing to serve them up brainstorm-style This collection was full of winning piecesfluid duster-length trench coats tops and jackets with sculptural pouf sleeves checked pencil dresses and skirts with muscular ruffles and bowsbut they were swamped by the surfeit of looks that featured complicated asymmetrics or vast volumes that felt nonspecific The motley print and pattern here and the way Alaverdian layered them together added to the sensory overload Its not that Alaverdian needs to trim down her ideassome looks like the A-line floral coat paired with a mid-calf seersucker skirt embellished with rosettes got at all (or at any rate most) of them with clarity and concision When she applies real rigor to her hyper-associative design process the charm of her aesthetic comes through$$Process has always been paramount to Ace & Jigs Jenna Wilson and Cary Vaughanin their own work but also as Spring tells it in that of others The pair were particularly fascinated with the German conceptual artist Wolfgang Laib who worked heavily in natural materials memorably gathering pollens of different consistencies and hue (dandelion hazelnut et al) and creating geometric shapes from them Some of Springs myriad prints nodded to those forms but there are plenty of inherent parallels to the duos process The looms in India that their cotton gauzes are woven on are traditional and time-honored a far cry from fashions heavily automated present Textiles are always the real news for Ace & Jig and Springs most winning developments included a graphic black-and-red stripe pitch-perfect as a column gown as well as nods to kente fabrics Warmth has long been a distinguishing characteristic of Wilson and Vaughans clothingthat came through here in spades Best of all was a stunning kimono with a hand-woven collar created in collaboration with Los Angeles textile studio All Roads$$A bohemian circle of muses have been in heavy rotation for the last couple of seasonsJoni Mitchell Janis Joplin and the likebut now it seems that things in fashion might be moving to a new musical beat Acne Studios creative director Jonny Johansson is certainly keen on pressing the fast-forward button and his latest collection vibrated with an energy that fell somewhere between 80s electro and 90s rave culture Electric guitars made of chrome and plexiglass which embellished the length of cropped trousers and boxy suiting were the most obvious leitmotifs here More convincing though were the eye-catching optical polka-dot prints that resembled the dilated pupils of euphoric ravers on floor-length velvet and silk dresses that were fastened in the back with guitar-like strapsa cool take on the slip dressing trend If one were to peg the collection to a stylish musical icon in particular it would likely be Grace Jones The radical 67-year-old Jamaican singer just published her memoirs and has been inspiring a new generation of fans with her risk-taking sorry-not-sorry sense of style Jones recently caused a stir at the Afropunk Festival in New York wearing one of her many elaborate costumes (it involved little more than a corset G-string body suit and a Hula-Hoop that she kept spinning around her lithe torso) The blazers-cum-minidresses that Johansson paired with short-as-you-dare hot pants and statement asymmetric shades were a look that Jones could pull off to this day though its doubtful who else could besides superstar bad gals like Rihanna perhaps who has been making headlines with her pantless ensembles all summer long In some ways it felt as if part of the grounding street smart vibrations that first propelled Acne into the spotlight were lacking today the cut and fit of their original oversized biker jackets and shearling coat is still hard to beat after all Still warm-weather dressing isn't something that Nordic fashion folk have much time to experiment with The discharge-print boy racer tees and charming checkerboard slip-on Moroccan slippers on the other hand are likely to be a hit with the first bloom of spring$$Walking into Adam Lippess Washington Square apartment presentation is a rare Fashion Week treat From the breakfast spread to his trio of standard poodles to this seasons piano player you feel instantly at home At the very least you want to move in  Against this exceedingly pleasing backdrop Lippes presented a fine new collection one that solidified his reputation for effortless chic but also found him developing new categories Lippes said an audacious floral-print suit from his Fall collection had something to do with his Spring experiments He figured its bold color and pattern would render it an outlier On the contrary its been a total sellout and its success gave him the license he needed to try a glam white jumpsuit with an outer layer in hand-macramd silk cord Its a feat of engineering and easily the sexiest thing hes done yet A strapless black silk faille gown was more demure but an equally convincing foray into high evening Still its his polished sportswear thats been helping him double his business each season so the big emphasis here was on daywear Pieces like a 16-ply cashmere sweatshirt accompanied by gold micro pliss pants as comfy as pjs a washed denim apron dress thrown over an oversize poplin tee and slouchy linen track pants teamed with a striped shirt its elongated tails hanging loose in back Lippess mo is refined but not so much so that it compromises his clothes casual factor Extra credit for the generously proportioned slip dresses in an Agnes Martininspired abstract print$$Ever the adventurer Adam Selman will gleefully chart a course where others dare not go Fall found him obsessed with Cookie Mueller an oft-overlooked bad girl in John Waterss morally bankrupt coterie This season Selman blew all the way to one of the smaller Hawaiian islands where he discovered Taylor Camp a 60s and 70s nudist colony on the oceanfront property of a witting Howard Taylor shortly after his impossibly glamorous sister Elizabeth played her baddest role yet in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf Selman is keenly aware that he has a fondness for foul-mouthed spitfires Ill always have my bad girls he chuckled backstage beaming through his signature stache Clothing isnt optional on a runway so Selman snapped out of his beach-induced high brushed off the sand and set about crafting latter-day hippiewear with a focus on what he called nonchalant exposure Joyful flower prints and appliqus on jaunty summer dresses bounded out to a cheery sing-along soundtrack They were mixed with breezy denim separates as well as white bandeaux and drawstring slacks some of which were reversed to reveal seams and pockets An erstwhile symbol of modesty gauzy crinolines were stripped of their cumbersome shells and placed front and center starting with the first exit Converse All Stars were also reworked DIY-style to become platform espadrilles However a baby tee with an illustrated image of a woman smoking a blunt was obscured by a denim jacket by the time it hit the catwalk This wasnt just a nod to pot-smoking free-loving skin-baring hippies but also an ode to an authentic craftsy look in particular the work of Todd Oldham the designer perhaps best loved for so artfully cobbling things together on MTVs House of Style with Cindy Crawford Unbeknownst to most there he was in the audience today happily yakking it up with more of Selmans bad girls Amy Sedaris and Lea DeLaria (Orange Is the New Black) Its a tribute to me asked Oldham after the show in believable disbelief He described how he and Selman had met while hanging wallpaper with Sedaris Im in awe of Adam he said Hes the real deal$$Hanako Maeda has been busy rediscovering her Japanese roots On a recent trip to Kyoto she grew particularly enamored of her native countrys architecture For Spring she focused on marrying the aesthetic heritage of Japan with the lean sophistication of New York her adopted hometown just as East met West during the Edo period Maedas clothes have never lacked in urbane appeal so it was a particular treat to see how she incorporated traditional elements and pitted structure against fluidity The past several seasons have witnessed the designer loosening up her once ladylike vernacular and there was a downright languidness to these pieces The kimono was of particular interest to Maeda who borrowed traditional prints from those garments and elements of the obi that cropped up on a flowing wrap dress or across the front of a long vest Elsewhere the knotted neckline on a gauzy maxi nodded to the process behind traditional shibori dyeing techniques and the red harness-like sash on a starry black-and-white gown (perhaps the strongest look in todays lineup) echoed the tasuki traditionally worn by Japanese drum players among others But you could hardly hope for a more fitting marriage of the modern-day and the traditional than Maedas raw indigo denim mini with a flowing underlay of shibori-printed chiffon Despite the newfound ease to her clothes Maeda remains as adroit as ever when it comes to evening Her strapless obi-inspired jacquard dress (look 29) was just the antidote to overwrought red carpet fare Between day and night these pieces added up to the labels strongest outing in recent memory If Maeda has had a tendency in the past to change her course a bit from season to season you hoped shed stay this one$$According to the folks at Adidas HQ this seasons Adidas by Stella McCartney collection was inspired by athletes Well    duh Isnt this an activewear line What McCartneys reflection on athletes and athleticism meant in practice was that this was a collection more focused on functionality than aestheticsthe updates mainly had to do with details of cut and fabrication that optimized the performance of the apparel That was witnessed in the feathery weight of the running gear and elements such as compression bands reflective strips mesh inserts and internal cooling dots placed at points on the body where the body generates the most heat McCartneys zebra-print maillots were cut with an eye toward hydrodynamismthey also looked a good deal hipper than the standard-issue racing suitand her seamless knit onesie managed to hark back to Western yoga practices boho roots and deploy new textile technology in aid of peak flexibility Women who are devotees of a particular sport will appreciate McCartneys care in seeing to their utilitarian needs those who mainly aim to compete in the sport of fashion meanwhile will glom on to pieces such as the designers floral-print anorak and ergonomic black-and-white sandal an excellent alternative come spring to the omnipresent Birk Performance was the focus here in other words but there was more than one way this collection performed$$This collection was an ode to Tiresias a bird-communicating Greek soothsayer who blabbed divine secrets and was punished by being blinded then turned into a womanas whom she was both praised as a priestess and pilloried as a prostitute (depending on who you read)before eventually gender-reverting Which is actually kind of now The clothes themselves seemed more literal articulations of the 18th century (perhaps edging the cusp of the 19th) in terms of form There were full-bodied frock coats with jauntily pointed tales corsetry an inclination toward ruffle-free yet jabot-like fullness at the neck and a sense of tailoring pared back and made primitive As an Aganovich virgin to these eyes there also seemed a soft backdrop of Ackermann Watanabe and Westwood here neither as debt nor derivation just context  The collection was an ongoing argument between the tie (masculine trope) and the color pink (feminine trope) Both tropes were warped abused remixed and blended Batik-dyed linen was the outer layer against folded-back flashes of silk organza animal print an inversion of hierarchy that saw the rougher fabric promoted to front of house with the snazzier pushed to the fringes There were moments when the fumes pumping forth from the Viper smoke machine became a little too thick to see all the orchid undulations on offer or to appreciate the twists in the muted monochrome brocades Yet there was clarity enough to appreciate this tightly packed meditation on wearable tumult$$This was a poignant presentationyet not necessarily in the way that Agnonas producers intended In the atrium a tree had been installed whose foliage was a mixture of desiccated leaves and dead butterflies From its lifeless branches hung 16 looks that were two-thirds miniaturized in cashmere voile11 from the archive and five from the new collection What they demonstrated was how rich the history of this mill specializing in rare yarns and founded by Francesco Ilorini Mo in 1953 truly is Balmain Dior Chanel Cardin Saint Laurent (when it was all about Yves)back in the day Agnona cast all of these canonical designers sketches in wool Agnona made brilliance real  Today Well its not awful Agnona is never going to be a summer house obviously Still there was a gorgeous suede wrap dress that while completely divorced from the essence of this brand was a thing of beauty and rightfully spotlighted center stage Some impressive hand-painted pliss pants were worth an ogle The brown leopard blouse was less moving the foliage-print caftans were definitely wearable but the safari jackets just served as piquant reminders of Saint Laurent Agnona is owned by Ermenegildo Zegnaa titanic fashion house whose main business is the sartorial outfitting of men The arrival of Stefano Pilati was heralded as a new dawn for the Agnona-Zegna womenswear dream team That plan changed when Pilatis focus shifted to the wonderful Zegna Couture In the meantime Agnona has been left out in the colda book without an author It deserves one$$Akriss Albert Kriemler has long looked to architecture as a reference but he made the relationship explicit for Spring teaming up with the Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto to create fabrics Fujimoto designed Londons Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in 2013 Kriemler was so moved by the matrix of white steel poles that he approached Fujimoto about working together Backstage it was hard to tell who was more excited about the collaborationKriemler or Fujimoto The architect sat in the front row it was his first fashion show Architecture is architecture and clothes are clothes Bringing them together isnt always the smoothest project Indeed there were a few proposals here that read as too literal A dress made from thin strips of cork to look like wood siding with a black mesh window at the hip for example was a little on the nose The Forest of Music is a music hall project in Budapest with a molded round roof that has openings for trees to grow The shirts and skirts it inspired were perhaps a tad eccentric for the Akris customer Where the clients are concerned the best pieces on the runway were the ones made from square slices of Perspex sealed between two layers of organza The streamlined dresses glinted subtly they wont require any backstory on the sales floor On the other hand if the Akris woman learns about Naoshima the Japanese island filled end-to-end with art museums and site-specific installations including Fujimotos faceted pavilion then this Akris collection was a job well done$$The backdrop of Alberta Ferrettis show was an aerial video of the desert sand sliding over mile upon mile of dunes nothing but sun wind and skyand just about as far away from Milans rain-soaked streets as you could get today The wide-open vistas offered clues to Ferrettis frame of mind The desert is free theres movement there are possibilities she said backstage I closed my eyes and we had many many ideas  Nature is a theme that Fausto Puglisi would take up a few hours later but where his version was rough around the edges Ferrettis this season was bohemian There was a bit of the festival girlCoachella by way of Burning Manto her pieced lace slip dresses and patchwork suede shifts in warm shades of brown and black Ferretti has made a specialty of whisper-thin dresses over the years Usually they have more of a red carpet orientation but true to her word here they came in breezy chiffons with fraying at the edges and as a decorative motif Along with the lacy white cotton numbers slightly Victorian in spirit these were among the best pieces in the show effortless and earthy perched on corded gladiator sandals where some of the more elaborately worked and printed dresses often with rough-hewn gold jewelry came off heavy and overdone  A detour through some safari-influenced daywear captured that easy vibe but they seemed rather beside the point At Alberta Ferretti the dress is always the thing$$For Spring Alessandra Rich unveiled an unabashedly feminine collection dubbed Dolores after an invented South American heroine one whose wardrobe for her romantic escapades is punctuated by expanses of lace frilled fluted hems and large poufy sleeves worn off the shoulder The story is of a girl who runs away to get married said Rich at an appointment off the Rue Saint-Honor characteristically charming and wearing one of the gold heartaccented belts that accessorized the runway looks Its probably a bad idea but she does it anyway And she does it in style An excellent waist-whittling trenchcoat in silk moir was offered in three colorways (black white and fuchsia) and proved just the ticket for a dramatic escape from disapproving parents and friends The wedding festivities would be celebrated in bow-topped tiers of fluffy white lace She is definitely a girl in love purred Rich and it shows party dresses came in pleated cutout off-the-shoulder lam or as a series of paillette-bedecked wiggle gowns with trumpet hems while a number of silk rompers were deployed for their lingerie codas (one plunging cream tie-accented dress was very Bianca Jagger) But among all of the exuberance it was the selection of seriously good denim (the use of the textile being a first for Rich) jackets body-conscious dresses and sleek jumpsuits that just might prove to outlast the honeymoon period After all as every girl knows flash can be fun but strong and steady often ends up winning the day$$And then there was light    Alexander Lewis isnt afraid of a religious reference but he wasnt riffing on Genesis in his new light-themed collection Rather on this occasion he took Richard Dawkinss tack and regarded the science of light with a near-spiritual sense of awe This season Lewis collaborated with the artist Flavie Audi who makes sculptures of metal and glass and he was fascinated by the way light plays on and within her work That inspired a study of the properties of lightits wavelike form the way it refracts through prisms how its reflection glimmers and splits across the surface of things It was a good season in other words for Lewis to have sponsorship from crystal honchos Swarovski Lewis got at his theme via a variety of means He made rubbings of Audis sculptures and developed cloud-like prints and patterned jacquards and he peered into the insides of her work and watched the alchemy of her materials then created galactic-looking prints that magnified those reactions There were also crystal-dappled sheer silks frequently found layered with other more plainspoken materials such as shirting pinstripe that recalled the reaction prints starry night sky effect Elsewhere Lewis conjured light waves via crystal strands dangling off a dress or caviar crystal pressed into the fabric of a pale blue skirt Blue was the key color here this collection also emphasized dresses and skirts more than most Lewis outings The collection was at its best oddly when Lewis interpreted his theme either extremely literally or extremely looselyhis pinstripe pieces were a highlight for instance but so was the sweater with a refracting prism intarsia-ed across the front and a cropped top with mirror cube embroidery The one quibble here really was with Lewiss insistence that all his garments express his concept either more or less directly In general his sense of focus redounds to his benefit but it would be nice to see this designer loosen up a little and permit himself to say cut a sharp pair of trousers or conjure a fluid flattering dress just because they complement the rest of his collection Lewis gets his points across just finehe should have the confidence going forward not to underline them$$The girls had pink-cheeked complexions and tousled hair flowing down their backsa bunch of young English roses who might have been caught by Julia Margaret Camerons camera lens in Victorian times What they were dressed in were the prettiest and most personal designs that have come from Sarah Burton since she took over as creative director of Alexander McQueen Gone were the face-obscuring headdresses and ironclad corsets gone the hobbling platform shoes I wanted it to be believable touchable soft said Burton backstage To an extent the beautiful dresseswith their ruffles cascading across the body and falling off shoulders the palette of pale pink the flower-strewn patterns the pristine cotton the tattered lace and the frock-coated tailoringspeak for themselves Everything about them in these times when every camera phone has a zoom lens can be examined in all their extraordinary detail down to the finest knitted stitches the flower-painted wooden clogs and the couture-level embroidery On the other hand for all that the ethereal lightness whip-smart tailoring and elaborate designs communicated a new relaxed of-the-season relevance they also carried the story of a London history that Burton wanted to make known  She explained that shed been inspired by the 17th-century silk weavers of Spitalfields members of the Huguenot Protestant faith who fled religious persecution in France and settled in Londons East End I loved the stories of how they arrived with very little bringing seeds and bulbs in their pockets to grow They were gardeners And they wove their French flowers into the patterns on their silks  Burtons choice of reference point was personalshe is a country girl with a real love of naturebut the resonances run deeper than her attraction to pretty flowers Alexander McQueen traced part of his family bloodline back to some of the estimated 50000 Huguenot refugees who were welcomed into Britain by the edict of King Charles II and became producers of high fashion silks for court finery and the great homes of England McQueen was proud of that link to the first immigrants to bring luxury fashion to London and he would surely approve of his former protge using this platform to point to the parallels with todays migrant crisis  There was one silk dress covered with sprigs of flowers that came somewhere in the middle of the collection and was a near replica of a 17th-century court dress Burton examined How funny to imagine that this delightful demure dress might have its own outing at the British court in the 21st century Kate Middleton would look wonderful in it$$Alexander Wang has always loved a bash and for his 10th anniversary collection tonight he threw himself a big one Up front a merch table sold his DoSomethingorg tees and sweats which benefit the organizations youth and social change efforts It was straight out of a rock show a feeling that was accentuated inside the venue by the crush of celebrities who sat in the front row Kanye West Nicki Minaj Lady Gaga Josh Ostrovsky (aka The Fat Jew) The Weeknd Bella Hadid Mary J Blige    the list goes on Post-show a curtain at the back of the runway opened to reveal a phalanx of pole dancers who entertained the throngs until it was time for the partys big numbers Tinashe Lil Wayne and Ludacris all performed But the nights main act was the video that played after the models took their finale spin An extended highlights reel it was a long loud chronological look back at Wangs first decade from his early bows short-haired and baby-faced at 21 all the way through last Novembers H&M collab and his Fall 15 advertising campaign  Its a critical moment for Wang In July he and Balenciaga opted not to renew their contract beyond its first three-year term Such a short tenure at such a prestigious house could tarnish a designers reputation but Wang has emerged essentially unscathed and as he seemed to be saying with tonights hoopla bigger than ever  When the split was announced Wang suggested that he wanted to turn his focus to his eponymous brand That meant expectations were elevated for this new collection If some of the surrounding festivities (ahem those pole dancers) were somewhat off-message he nailed the collection which was free of pretense No concept he said backstage summing up the straight-off-the-streets ethos of the clothes Were always asking ourselves whats modern Well whats modern is whats right in front of us Thats an idea thats gained traction in the industry over the last couple of years but it was Wangs own approach at the beginning It worked for him then and save for a couple of costumey fringed leather pieces it worked for him tonight with his deconstructed denim army surplus separates pajama silks slip dresses and one shrunken satin bomber jacket Wang intuitively gets what the downtown cool girl wants to wear Theres no disputing the New Yorkiness of his clothes but no anniversary collection is complete without a throwback moment Anybody still wondering what the AW510 insignia that turned up on an oversize hoodie and some of the mens pieces stands for Wang remember hails from Northern California 510 is the born-in-the-Bay-Area area code of his cellphone$$Few and far between are the menswear designers willing and able to transition into the womens market In fact its a genuinely rare scenario that often builds in reverse so when ex-Cloak designer Alexandre Plokhov tried his hand at a ladies line for Fall 2015 trusting devotees welcomed his evolution with open arms Now that moody almost all-black debut is hitting stores the Eve to Plokhovs Adam has hit her stride for Springforegoing the darkly draped tendency of his first outing in favor of a crisp sensuality where D-ring cinched belts snap-buttoned patch pockets and zipped lapels helped shape his utilitarian vision Having tweaked a cropped tailoring silhouette and developed a wrapped linear form to his apron dresses and boxy tunics Plokhov accented this collection with a slew of subtly worked-on fabricsturning to washed leather patchwork jersey polka dots and a shredded stripe jacquard that felt rich in hand against his flat cotton poplins The latter material was frayed and box-pleated across shirtsleeves and buttoned A-line skirts both of which appeared in a sunny shade of citrus yellow in his Paris showroom Though edited out of these images that optimistic shade joined the black navy and sand color lineup to further shake up the masculine tendencies of Plokhovs oeuvre rendering his outsider label all the more relevant in a season rife with gender ambiguity$$If you laid out the looks from Alexandre Vauthiers Fall haute couture collection alongside those he proposed for Spring ready-to-wear youd very quickly have a stack of matching pairsright down to the shoes produced by Sebastian Of course nothing would be identical for ready-to-wear Maison Lesage hand-embroidery became mechanical and the leather fringes now appeared in jersey But the gist was there Even Daria Strokus who closed Vauthiers couture show returned as his ready-to-wear leading lady (looking particularly femme fatale in the Oscar Niemeyerdesigned French Communist Party Headquarters) The temptation to declare dj vu lessens once you take the holistic view that a designer needs a top-notch testing ground to breed the best ideas (and for what its worth Raf does the same over at Dior) Plus Vauthier upholds his fixation with fitthe body-grazing blazers and body-con laced bias dresses revealed curves not compromises He took pride in showing how he turned an obscenely expensive lace-encrusted dress into a generally expensive lace-encrusted dress without a noticeable difference And the opium red leather biker dress was basically a dead ringer In fact the biggest difference with Vauthiers ready-to-wear offering was the injection of filler pieces sexy bodysuits tailored vests and an LBD that can be worn loose and poncho-style or sleekly belted Within the past two weeks Aubrey Plaza Suki Waterhouse and Vauthiers loyal patroness Carine have all furthered his red carpet visibility But while this may be prime advertising the introduction of a dressed-down linen grouping suggested its not his sole focus Each of the piecesbe it a jumpsuit or a shirtdressreceived some sort of Vauthier golden touch Maybe theyll prove the launchpad for his Spring couture$$In 2011 a food-supply scandal made the news in China when watermelon farmers who had sprayed their crops with a chemical product that promised rapid growth were dismayed to discover it served only to make their melons explode into worthless pulp Earlier this month a minority stake in Alexis Mabille was sold to a 3400-outlet Chinese fast-fashion outfit called Peacebird which plans to roll out a network of Mabille stores in China Mabille chose the watermelon as his motif for this his first post-Peacebird ready-to-wear collection There was a sequined watermelon on the front of a ruche-armed sweatshirt teamed with some jaunty shorts and a sheer half-skirt watermelon print split-to-the-hip pants watermelon bracelets watermelon necklacesyou get the drift More ambiently watermelon-touched were the dubious contra-color layered lace slip dressesin watermelon-esque tonesand satin separates This collection was at its best when sans watermelon yet explosive of silhouette The oversize biker jackets and skirts were easy and fun There was also a sweet 80s-flavor jumpsuit with volumized arms and a tonal fold at the neck Plus Mabille slices a pretty fine jacket The single vented (watermelon) red example with an interestingly projecting revere was proof of that There was an emphasis on open-at-the-back shirtingperfectly fineand an insistence on miniature backpack fanny packskind of Philipp Plein This was very much a locals show packed to its marble rafters with Parisians breathily just-about tolerating (as only Parisians can) the abundance of their fellows The new Peacebird aspect to Mabilles story lent it an edge which the clothes unfortunately rather lacked It also made you really hanker after a nice ripe slice of lovely juicy watermelon organic ideally$$I feel like baby number three sort of inspired the desert vibes said Alice + Olivia designer Stacey Bendet who is scheduled to give birth next Tuesday and still had the wherewithal to slip into a minidress and thigh-high platform boots for her presentation today This pregnancy got me really thinking about the inner goddess of the woman which led me somehow to the desert she said Of course the aforementioned bump made traveling a good deal trickier Bendet thus relied on the desert of her imagination conjuring up images of Earth Mothers and boho babes frolicking among the dunes in hand-embroidered skirts flouncy off-the-shoulder tops and gowns and sun-baked neutrals It helped too that she had a man on the ground [Contemporary artist] Francesco Clemente is a good friend of mine and he kept texting me photos of desert butterflies and flowers so that also helped to inspire the collection said Bendet Overall this was a softer more romantic outing for Alice + Olivia Bendet worked with chiffons and ruffles in pale shades of nude blush and icy blue to create what she dubbed her goddess gowns She also wanted to create dresses that could be worn during the day with flats but would still be sufficiently special for evening Bendet accomplished her goal in the patchwork lace dresses in black and faded ivory that swished delicately at the ankle Meanwhile a high-neck gown hand-embroidered with flowers was exactly the kind of thing one dreams of wearing to a Mexican wedding one day While Alice + Olivia is still strongest in the eveningwear category Bendet had plenty on offer for day too The designer introduced a line of couture denim into the collection this seasonflared jeans that had been hand-embroidered with flowers or laser-cut in a leaf pattern I really wanted to focus on the return of the pant as a statement item said Bendet who also churned out embellished wide-leg gown pants Every season the designer includes a capsule black-and-white collectionmixed in with the boho embroidery and soft hues those pieces felt a little out of place this go-round However Bendet knows her customers well and each season a portion of them unfailingly want black and white Sometimes creative vision has to bow to good old-fashioned business sense$$There are responsibilities laid before fashion designers like 32-year-old Joseph Altuzarra the chief of which is the pressure to capture the times in the form of clothes This season one of the instincts which is being thrust to the fore is escapism or at least a resistance to the troubling forces at work in the world Altuzarras answer to that was a Spring collection he described in his studio as Very serene about the beauty of materials which are close to nature like linen cotton and burlap things which are not fussy and meant to look wrinkled The search for authentic emotion led him to research the Spanish side of his identitythe heritage of his fathers upbringing in the rugged Basque region of northern Spain home to self-reliant mountain-dwelling and sea-faring people On the other hand Altuzarras own reality is very much attuned to a certain modern urban womans demands or at least his interpretation of them Its all very well yearning for the wild and free but what does that look like when walking on the streets of New York Altuzarras creative compromise could be read in the details high-heeled espadrilles (partly made by a Spanish craftsman) braided jute shoulder straps on skimpy linen camisole dresses and rope frogging on navy nautical blazers and jumpsuits He had worked hard on injecting a sense of the handmade into his textiles with lots of pleating derivedat some distancefrom folkloric costume hand-painted prints in greens blues and sunrise orange and some beautiful micro beaded embroideries on broderie anglaise at the end It made for a collection which was at its most appealing in the hand and on a rail where the minutiae and the weightlessness of the fabricsand their rare luxurious qualitiescould be felt One could also see Altuzarras pragmatic understanding of clothes that can perform in the midst of urban heat (as well as the close-up chic of such things as the tan leather saddle-stitched clip-on earrings) On the runway though the presentation somehow lacked the sense of joie de vivre women look for in summer even in baking cities and on their way to work Maybe that had to do with Altuzarras choice of uniformly ultra-slim models whose unsmiling neutrality failed to bring his stated aim of carefree believably to life Whether its summer winter or anything in between Altuzarra's work with its man-attracting slit skirts and dresses would look a whole lot sexier on a knowing womans curves Customers would see that in a changing room doubtless but it would be a healthy humanizing step forward if Altuzarra could bring himself to show it on the runway too$$Designers often use music as an inspiration This season Andre Walkers collection riffed on a single song Althea & Donnas 1977 reggae classic Uptown Top Ranking At an appointment this afternoon Walker said hed always wanted to do a thesis on that tracka really truly terrific one if youve never heard itand explained that hed dug into its lyrics to further his brainstorming Dem check sey we hipWalkers check came in linen and looked plenty hip in garments such as his short-sleeved tailored jacket with its folded-under blurred hem See me in a halter back    give you a heart attackWalkers funnel-neck halter-tops were sui generis in particular coming in a cotton print of head sculptures by his friend and frequent collaborator Sylvie Auvray He did his own versions of the songs khaki suit too albeit in dove gray Walkers (admittedly casual) research extended beyond the lyrics of Uptown Top Ranking He also asked his parents what had been going on in Kingston Jamaica around the time the track was recorded They told him that denizens of the uptown area of the city had marked off their territory as a posh one and taken to natty dressing to suit the attitude One of the charms of Walkers collection was that it got at that nattinessnote his pencil skirts cape-shouldered jacket tops and precise tailored dresses with their cutout sideswhile simultaneously summoning the chillaxed vibe of the song that had inspired him Mesh-like pointelle knits and a generous helping of fishnet provided the collection with some breeziness both literally and figuratively while skirts cut to suggest the look of shorts or slouchy trousers introduced another kind of casual mien Much of Walkers focus here was on fuzzing the hard edges of his silhouettes as witnessed in that blurred hem jacket for instance but also in standout garments like his layered gray eyelet and white fishnet pencil skirt and a cropped jacket with soft vertical pleats in the front Perhaps that instinct to soften was another tribute to Althea & Donnaafter all the most famous lyrics in their one big hit go Love is all I bring And this collection certainly felt open-hearted$$As the lights dimmed to signal the start of Andrew Gns show an omniscient accented voice gravely announced that the designer had just undergone unexpected surgery for a heart condition Despite a promising recovery he could not be present Andrew has worked on this collection until the last moment with all his passion and determination the voice continued He hopes you will like it Leaving barely a minute to process Gns life-threatening episode the pulsing music began and the show went on beginning with dynamic daywear inspired by getaways to the north of France and ending with sumptuously embellished gowns based on a Chinese imperial porcelain bowl Gn inherited from his parents  Delineating the collection into two seemingly disparate parts confirmed that Gn is creatively ambidextrous and clearly enjoys the freedom to propose sharp and soft in a single offering The latter resituated the butterflies and peonies from his family heirloom against vibrant backgrounds like a Pop Art homage to chinoiserie While the butterflies were as detailed as any of the specimens on display at Deyrolle the embroideries and multicolored stones turned pretty dresses into collector pieces Waxing rhapsodic about surface treatments feels strange given the circumstances Fashion may course through Gns veinshed sooner be inspired by the idea of a vacation than take onebut health comes before all else So Andrew we wish you a smooth and speedy recovery And rest assured we liked it$$Give Angelos Bratis the plainest piece of fabric and in no time itll be transformed into a draped wonder He is an intuitive dressmaker Hes adamant about not being called a designer No sketches or mood boards for himjust thoughtful consideration of body shape Working on this collection was a sort of therapy for me said Bratis during a walk-through held in a light-filled hypermodern space where models where standing in front of a maze of mirrors that reflected the surrounding forest of skyscrapers part of a newly built Milanese architectural landscape  Bratis retreated to his native Greek village in the mountains near Athens to put together a lineup of beautiful dresses with the help of his mother She is a great seamstressshe taught me everything he said pointing out liquid bias-cut polka-dot numbers cut from a single piece of silk with decorative smock motifs hand-sewn with contrasting thread I was thinking about the myth of Ariadne my Greek heritage comes up in the most unexpected ways through memories images dreams I love geometry arithmetic the mathematics of dance the logic game of music and rhythm But there is nothing conceptual about Bratiss creative process Hes a sensualist and his dresses reveal love and respect for the female body Their shapes had a free flow they were cut in fluid languid fabrics and built with sophisticated draping effects their asymmetric hems skimming the body and giving way to a soft undulating movement Not surprisingly Aegean blue was the color of choice an homage to Bratiss homeland that was also expressed in the melancholic melodies played by the harpist Vanja Contu clad in one of Bratiss elegant kaftans$$On heels so soaring that the average height of these looks was within a whisper of six and a half feet this Ann Demeulemeester collection trod pointedly around themes of personal expression recreational repression and commercial concession The topstitched paneled black tailoring of which the facades veered from biker to tuxedo the painstakingly ruched black leather pants and the backless black tank topsslash-waistcoats with a melee of obi-belt knotting at the navel were all no-brainer ticks on a buyers list The Demeulemeester codes factor in waft and sheerness so more ticksalthough perhaps applied a touch less firmlyat the lightly fitted transparent racer-back silk dresses sometimes metallically agleam and long jackets in softly acid blurrily animal greens and yellows Artistic director Sebastien Meunier said the collection was titled Rising and that his starting point was the angular unreality of Alberto Giacometti then added It is about the extreme elegance of women how tall how bright how mysterious they can be I pushed them in a super-elegant kinky sadomasochist form This explained the choker-topped harnesses that were sometimes effectivewho knew a white harness under black suiting complemented by white sunglasses could be an uncreepily powerful accessory arsenal Yet S&M motifs speak of subjugationalbeit consensualas well as power and so seem only queasily reconcilable with the runway The oily chartreuse feathering on sleeves and coral-like clusters of quills were here thanks to Meuniers collaboration on this collection with artist Kate MccGwire The quilled pieces were simultaneously beautiful and sad organic reductions into abstraction for the sake of it This lineup lacked the uplift that Meuniers last menswear outing seemed to augur Yet for those who enjoy pain this was not a pleasure to watchbecause it was fine$$The penultimate day of the New York show sprint and who among us isnt in need of a visit to some far-flung beachy locale Thats just what Anna Sui served up tonight albeit only a stones throw from the fracas of an assembled many awaiting another iconoclast (the lady Madge) over at Madison Square Garden Prompted by a recent getaway of her own to Tahiti and Honolulu Sui riffed on pops long-standing affair with island life from the 30s starlet Dorothy Lamour to Elviss trinity of Hawaiian movies to David Baileys shot of a bronzed sun-soaked Marie Helvin Even Jane Campions high-minded New Zealand period piece The Piano made the cut in the form of a little subtly placed Victoriana Suis tendency toward an almost magpie-like archivists eye remains one of her more defining and compelling characteristics In addition to the above references she looked at sailors valentines (the intricate seashell artworks) and even lifted a phrase from the 1941 Gary Cooper vehicle Ball of Fire killer diller the choice slang of Barbara Stanwycks lippy nightclub performer Sugarpuss OShea came embroidered across the back of a top Indeed todays Honolulu honeys embodied all the best parts of kitsch its color its humor its play Bowling shirts and souvenir jackets came to new life in Suis hands the latter enjoyed a major revival last season but even if they were downright du monde youd be hard-pressed to argue with Suis take lushly beaded with lurid-looking sunsets and pinup mermaids Elsewhere was a dreamy marabou-trimmed peignoir that seemed to have dropped straight out of a Bunny Yeager snap and onto the palm treedotted catwalk It all made for a deliciously heightened version of the tourist tat of another era And what of the prints Sui enlisted the fabled Zandra Rhodes to create a custom pattern a delightful seashell number (Gigi Hadid very memorably donned a scarlet sarong in it) One Lurex-drenched undersea chiffonwith angel fishes and allwas a real winner Sui also sent out an octopus intarsia and board shorts crafted from a heady-looking butterfly lace  Even as fashion continues to ride high on a wave of heavy minimalism (though a sea change is surely in the works) Sui is a designer who serves as a vivid testimony to the power of well-deployed profusion Todays was the kind of blissful high-energy romp to assist even the most fatigued among ussocks and sandals optional$$Upon arrival at the Anrealage show at the Palais de Tokyo this afternoon guests were greeted by waiters carrying trays of glasses In one there was water in the other sake Both clear liquids entirely alike in all properties except the important ones Really you seeits all in how you look at things Until of course it isnt Wireless headsets and elaborate instructions had been left on the seats The Springcollection one quickly gathered via the pamphlet and theEnglish robotic voice provided by the accompanying recording (think Benedict Cumberbatch meets Siri) was inspired by reflection specifically how it warps reality The clothes would only be fully visible through an iPhones camera app after being photographed with a flasha very modern take on a mirror its true but considering the plethora of devices held aloft during Fashion Week not exactly a stretch When the clothes appeared and were drowned in a flurry of handheld flashes what first appeared to be a plain light gray or black-and-white striped dress became a neon houndstooth check a glen plaid transformed into a tartan a fancy tweed a patchwork pinstripes were lace white became a kaleidoscope pattern Mt Fuji a quilt A speckled-looking frilledblack frock suddenly boasted the galaxy at warp speed courtesy of what the show notes described as an official collaboration with the filmStar Wars (which if true should provide at least one of the upcomingfilms young stars with a seriously viable red carpet ensemble for an upcoming Comic-Con) Often the garments themselves were reversed inverted rejiggered two pieces sewn together at the hemisphere to make a slightly off-kilter asymmetrical form which came out a lot more appealingly than it sounds especially in the case of the cropped bomber jackets rounded sleeve sheaths and short A-line shifts One has come to expect this level of technological trickery from designerKunihiko Morinaga who has played with the ideas of exposure light and shadow before But here his fabric innovationsdeveloped in collaboration with a company that specializes in recursive reflective paint the type used in markers and signs at construction sitescame with a smattering of actually wearable shapes a combination that promises to move beyond the purely conceptual and into actual closets (Plus it must be said What a good party trick)$$For a Spring season theres been remarkably little heat on the runway Its been one more or less sexless show after another then along comes Anthony Vaccarello  The Belgian-Italian designer as his fans and his detractors like to say never met a slit he didnt like and in typical fashion this show was full of them But there were also other things happening new things that made this outing feel like Vaccarellos most diverse to date Take for instance the T-shirt and tank dresses printed with a closeup of his friend and muse Anja Rubiks face As they approached it became clear that the dresses werent printed at all but rather embellished with gradient clusters of studs depicting photographer Collier Schorrs portrait of the unmistakable model Just think of the Instagram possibilities Also novel Tattoo prints on crisp white cotton button-downs Vaccarello has a distinct point of view and until now there hasnt been much room in it for such decorative motifs But now that hes up and running at Versus Versacehe took his first solo bow there a week and a half agohes clearly set his mind to expanding the world of AV To that end he made a big push into denim the entry-level price-point item that can really goose a brands bottom line High-waisted styles one accessorized with a denim belt that grazed the rib cage will be about as forgiving as his hip-high slits but there were loose-fitting boyfriend jeans in the mix that will appeal to a broader swath of body types  Vaccarello also put his first bags on the runway The gold detailing on a pair of cross-body styles echoed the hardware that accented this collections strong military-influenced tailoring and its drapey jersey numbers Binx Walton fashions tomboy du jour looked terrific in the one-shoulder asymmetric-skirt bathing suit dress Best in show however goes to Edie Campbells fitted officers jacket and sexy black jeans$$Antonio Berardis stated theme for Spring was distressed glamour He got at it best at his show this morning via his use of transparency and his lacing and fringe The strongest look by far was a knit dress with a leotard-like top and a full skirt in a cobweb weave it was a bit of a shame he didnt explore that idea further But there were other similar nearly as nice touches such as the pieces composed in part of a knit done out of shiny filament-fine yarn or window-paned in sheer chiffon Meanwhile the most focused part of this collection were the looks in black crepe that featured skin-winking lacing that spilled out in fringe Much of the action here was going on in the back of these looks Many of Berardis diaphanous dresses and skirts came with long trains and a number of jackets tailored through the front opened up in back in soft pleats There were also evening coats with internal crystal straps that allowed the coats to be slung off the shoulders like a backpack a design nicked from activewear That wasnt a bad idea but it was one of several in this show that didnt seem fully thought through certainly not in relation to the collection as a whole Berardis intention throughout seemed to be to mix baroque formality with undone-looking or off-kilter shapes There was an appealing collection hiding somewhere inside this busy outing but overall it suffered from a too much of muchness$$After pausing to give his wife Patrizia a fervently Italian squeeze (youd get slapped for that anywhere else) Antonio Marras contemplated his board and said I start with the simple lines and the simple shapes But in the end I think normality is too boring I prefer eccentricity As do the Marras-ophiles who flocked backstage after this well-received show You can see why Season in season out he delivers variations on a template though with Marras sameness is a virtue that reflects a depth of imagination not its absence His vision is dense delightful and particular to him The Spring 16 collection was touched by the work of the state-imprisoned Soviet-era Armenian director Sergei Parajanov The fruit left on the front row was a nod to Parajanovs 1969 film The Color of Pomegranates the broken-plate print on the first three looks reflected his work while the richly dun palette ornamented headpieces and occasionally literal swerves into a broad-belted full-skirted folk-dress silhouette nodded to the culture Parajanov was persecuted for propagating As was a carpet-backed set of 14 Styrofoam boulders twined to the ceiling two of which were mysteriously elevated for a rush-to-the-cameras finale of models in refashioned vintage white shirts and dresses studded with stones and layered with embroidery The mass of the collection was Marrass signature dervish concatenation of tiered apron dresses full skirts wide pants and frock-coats splattered with broderie anglaise embroidered patchwork printed panels beading tweed and sequined appliqus There was a lovely fil coupe stamped with plated-print circles of tarnished gold silver and bronze The shoes ran a gamut from fabulous wood-soled platform sandals to bullet-toed embellished sneakers With very few exceptions this was a collection that looked easy to wear but was hard not to stare at As Marras put it I like a lot of things together$$Anya Hindmarch likes to pack her shows full of very English fun and games She has been known to build magic teacup rides into her runways and once bussed in a full chorus of male choir singers dressed as road workers for her traffic-themed presentation Hindmarchs fondness for all things British led her to the high street this season and she incorporated the branding of some of the UKs best-loved stores into her tongue-in-cheek designs If you grew up in London in the 80s you might have recognized the saying emblazoned across a tote bag that read Never Knowingly Undersold as the tagline for the famed department store John Lewis A pair of leather knee-highs was cleverly stamped with the logo for Boots Englands answer to Duane Reade Hindmarch showed that those cultural witticisms could be used in subtler ways too and the letters WHS (short for WHSmith the popular British newsagent and stationery store) were repeated in a cool graphic pattern which made for an unexpected take on logomania  The humor in those everyday references will likely be lost on Anya Hindmarch fans outside of British borders though Still the designer didnt lose the smiley faces from her handbags altogether The bite-sized additions to the collection like mini soda-can key ring purses will surely tickle the fancy of accessories fanatics the world over$$When Apiece Apart launched in 2008 its organizing principle was modularity Designers Laura Cramer and Starr Hout wanted all their clothes to mix and match togethernot just within collections but between seasons and over the years What those modular clothes lacked in romance they more than made up for in durability Longtime Apiece Apart fans will attest that they still wear looks from the earliest collections Modularity is no longer the organizing principle of the label Cramer and Hout have loosened the reins on their concept over the years making clothes that are versatile and un-faddish but that impart some emotional resonance They hit a sweet spot this season drawing on Luis Barragns emotional architecture for inspiration Cramer and Hout have long hewed to the look of Mexico and the Southwest and the elements of those aesthetics that they drew on here fit organically into the established Apiece Apart vernacular The tonal embroidery and hand-crochet in this collection was new for the brand but it didnt feel that way The designers also worked in proven silhouettes giving them just a touch of an updatethe easy dresses that could be cinched or worn loose continued an idea they debuted for Resort while the ruffled crop tops made for a flirty reiteration of one of their most popular shapes The real development was in the knits Alongside the excellent fine-cotton ribsanother continuation from Resortwere sweaters with lacelike texture and engineered knit pieces emblazoned with graphic stripes The engineered knit tube skirt and matching ruffled bandeau was a look with terrific pop and it made for a nice counterpoint to the gauziness of the collection overall Even the punchiest items still read as staples that would wear well over the yearsyou could even see them paired with pieces from the Apiece Apart debut$$With the exception of committing factual error to publication the hollowest feeling a fashion critic can experience is the sensation of tacking against the wind of consensus For at its essence fashion is a tautly wrought tumbleweed of aesthetic agreement So if everyone says A when you feel B about C does that make you a Z And like OMG This AquilanoRimondi collection prompted a mild shiver of that unlovely sensation Good luck with that said one powerful tastemaker as we bundled toward the door after this show Last-chance saloon summated another as we bundled preshow toward it Yet the most damning thing these eyes observed about this collection was the odd flash of meh The idea of wearing paillette miniskirts as oomphed-up belts over long-yolked menswear shirts wasnt deeply flatteringthe tip of the yolk dangled unfortunately The shirts themselves though were excellent especially an endearing short-sleeved one with proper dress shirt cuffs There were some interesting takes on the nightie/sleep slip as outwear ARs versions were scalpel sliced and when there came ruffle it was applied with a more censoriously resistant eye to abandon than most designers have succumbed to this season minimal romantic The transliteration of Warhol florals to paillette reliefs was efficiently OK And the X-ray white organza jacket that revealed the skeleton of its tailoring was strong yet even better when fully opaque and black AR seems to be languishing under a reputational cloud but this collectionwhile no life changersignaled shafts of sunlight$$It may be the labels first season with a slot on the New York Fashion Week show roster but Area sure knows how to make an entrance The brainchild of Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk today the brand took over an airy room at The Standard and set their vision to life with an uncanny 70s beauty ad writ large Makeup was in fact Springs prcis as seen through the lens of some kind of gauzy disco daydream Doe-eyed faintly dazed-looking models milled around vanity tables silk dresses came encrusted with smudges of silvery glitter and glossy nude foundation smears and baroque slippers with Perspex heels were    just plainly beautiful Glitter or no chromes got to shine too so the designers whipped up the blush tire-rim print seen on a textured cream trench Elsewhere they proposed plunging wrap-front minis and lithe maxi dresses befitting Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface one of the iridescent mesh gowns would look great on the red carpet The spare clothes that Fogg and Panszczyk (alums of Calvin Klein Collection and Emanuel Ungaro respectively) create and the Braille-like embossing that has been their signature since the brands 2013 inception resulted in a generally sporty lean aesthetic But this outing was one that showed a new dimension Opening Ceremony was an early retail coup for the brand After today other tastemakers are sure to follow suit$$Its been a big week for Arthur Arbesser one of Milans new generation of designers Last Friday he presented his first collection for the Italian sportswear company Iceberg and today an hour before his longtime former employer Giorgio Armani put on his own show Arbesser took his young eponymous brand to the runway for the first time There was already a sense of occasion It was a fact Arbesser opted to accentuate by recruiting his friend the composer and musician Jordan Hunt to play live music and by installing in the middle of the room a giant Balthus cat and a young woman who played the artists model on a low velvet chair Balthuss favorite subjects were adolescent girls and Arbesser used the famous painters oeuvre as a framework The models hair was scraped carelessly to the side with bobby pins and they wore white anklets with both their patent slingbacks and their Nikes The pubescent edge-of-innocence thing can go dreadfully wrong Its a tribute to Arbessers sensitive spirit and that of his collaborators that it didnt At 33 hes fairly youthful himself he gets how young women want to dress A paper-thin technical nylon coat and matching pants brought a sleek athletic edge to the collection that felt genuine But the stars were illustrator Agathe Singers lovely prints If the naive cat motif on a pair of overalls and a raincoat wont be for everyone the lively floral that appeared on a flirty little dress a pantsuit and a long-sleeved T-shirt gown will find admirers well past their teenage years This writer can attest to that$$The pile of sequins scattered haphazardly atop a bench caught Ashish Guptas eye as he and his team were in the studio doing research I thought they just looked beautiful the designer said So he thought why try and impose order when disorder looks so great Thus this Ashish collection memorably preambled with a group of girls who skated the runway variously wearing DIY-touched tracksuits a slip skirt a frayed and washed denim T-shirt and lairy-fairy dresses wreathed in tulle Like nigh on every look in his Spring 2016 theirs were speckled and heaped with Ashishs random-on-purpose drifts of candy-tone sparkle They also emanated a pleasing Larry Clarkish truculenceattitude basically Then the show-run started in earnest with another ka-boom On the left was Larry B the London DJ on the right was Jay Boogie the man in Look 2 is Maximillian The crowd whooped even harder When they got to the end of the runway they initiated what became another walk-the-floor flourish that ran through the show by tossing handfuls of sequins at the crowd Later Larry came out again in a spaghetti-strap slip illustrated with some pertinent details Ashish explained I always want my shows to be a celebration of subcultures And I felt that Larrys dress was an important statement in the context of Caitlyn Jenner but also racial issues too This was a show in which the overwhelming message was its rejection of categories through inclusion Because were all just little sparkles jumbled together There were some striking outfits in here toothe one-piece hybrids of sari and jeans most lovablybut that message was the thing$$Its all well and good to talk about the 70s 80s and 90s but theres a generation of young designers who were raised on Y2K values The trashy moody bad girls of the turn of the millennium loomed large in Ashley Williamss imagination for Spring a motley crew of fictional and real-life characters that started with Emily the Strange and ended with Avril Lavigne  The 27-year-old designer has a soft spot for a skaters wardrobeher boyfriend Palace Skateboards founder Lev Tanju sat in the front rowalthough this season the vibe was more Camden Market goth does Black Swan and PVC trenchcoats came emblazoned with a tag that read Ashley Williams Ballet School and were worn with black tutus demented tiaras and fishnet tights That unapologetically brazen attitude also speaks to the aesthetic of a certain stylish bad gal of our times and you can imagine Rihanna strutting her stuff in one of Williamss No Code of Conduct tees or in her slip dress printed with flies and laced up in neon straps After an age of buttoned-up minimalism its an exuberant and cheeky sexiness that cool young girls can relate to right now The striped and pointy elf hats though are perhaps a tad too bad to be good$$Greg Armas usually has a self-described meta backstory when it comes to his collections This time he focused on bringing back the wardrobes of disappeared heroines I started finding that a lot of interesting academic psychic explorer and adventurous avatar-type of individuals seem to disappear said Armas The classic examples were Amelia Earhart and Maria Orsic A hefty narrative which of course raises the question What would the mysteriously vanished duo wear Their closets were surprisingly pared back Armas reimagined Earharts look the day she disappeared as a slouchy white jumpsuit and a trenchcoat with an oversize collar More utilitarian and aviator influences were referenced in loose cotton trousers and a paisley bomber jacket As for Orsic a stunning German medium who performed sances during World War II and eventually disappeared in 1945 her hypnotic staples included a romantic crepe twist top with naval-skimming dcolletage and cascading shorts as well as a slinky red silk maxi dress When it came to Armass use of denim the personal styles of the two women merged more closely Think indigo denim overalls for Earhart and a set of optic white wide-leg denim trousers for Orsic a loose chambray shirtdress meanwhile could have been worn by either muse There was also a pair of jeans patchworked with vintage squares of varying washes each hailing from a different decadea piece that could work for any woman with a modern-day-daredevil sartorial flair$$For Tony Melillo it all goes back to the T-shirt He started his line ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo just under four years ago with a tightly edited range of tees tanks and sweats in neutral shades of white and black While his business has since grown to reach every corner of the modern girls wardrobe from leather joggers to work-ready suits the concept of the perfect T-shirt is still the heart of the brand Shoppers who discover ATM at department stores like Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue collect the drapey Modal tees by the armful and this season Melillo introduced the Schoolboy tee a boxy slightly androgynous cut that lends itself perfectly to high-rise jeans But even Melillos more high-concept pieces are designed with the T-shirt in mind A shimmering charcoal parka in his Spring lineup was actually made of coated jersey so the slick high-shine exterior had a soft familiar interior Similarly ATMs sharp suits were constructed from textured woven fabrics instead of stiff wool and they were paired withwhat elseT-shirts not blouses Relaxed elegance is how Melillo described his point of view It was easy for us to go into all these categories [after starting with T-shirts] as crazy as it may seem We just stayed true to the brand identity  As such Melillos collections are more about luxurious wearable clothes than specific references But Spring was loosely based on the art of travel People always say ATM is perfect for traveling so I was thinking about what a chic traveler would wear he said That isnt to suggest you should hit the airport in heels rather Melillos ribbed-knit sweatpants would look sleek not sloppy with white sneakers and say one of his neoprene blazers which would bounce back after being stuffed into your carry-on Of course his supersoft tees which are manufactured in Peru are perfect not only for planes trains and automobiles but for every aspect of your daily life too which is certainly a sweet spot to be in$$It was extra-unfortunate that the branding of Dashthe Italian detergent that Au Jour Le Jour signed a deal with to sponsor this show and whose logos were incorporated into the collectionwas so deeply reminiscent of Fresh the new fragrance launched at Moschino on Thursday Moschino has long been the don of ironic Pop Art appropriation of mass-branding into high fashion and although the AJLJ efforts to service its sponsors (logoed boots a finely produced knit miniskirt and shirt and some spangly slip dresses) were cute the advertorial nature of the exercise undermined it The point of Moschino for house founder Franco and current designer Jeremy Scott presumably was and is designing clothes to say something not just get paid Still the collection was lively The schtick consistent with the sponsor (Dash) was stains So sequined jeans vests and black suede boots appeared splattered by scarlet ketchup An opening section of sixties-eque mock croc color-blocked tartan suits and shifts worn over organza shirts were prettily polluted by more sequin stains of coffee and blood Splodges were turned into camouflage oozing contra-colored gloop ran down in panels on more colored faux croc and enamel stains were dripped onto paillette minis As street style fare this was good fun but the biggest stain in a collection full of them was that overly articulated commercial transaction$$Audra Danielle Noyes is a young designer having made her way nearly straight from her studies at Savannah College of Art and Design to Paris where she cut her teeth at Lanvin and John Galliano And so her Spring prcis was one no doubt informed by her own experiences which delved deeply into the metamorphosis of a young woman That idea came to life specifically in the notion of searching for freedom within control An airy striped cotton silk jacquard she explained at a preview nodded to the strings of a marionette a peplumed top with a cutout toyed with the idea of vulnerability At times that reference felt slightly labored you didnt need multilayered conceits to appreciate Noyess winning marriage of American sportswear and demi-couture sensibilities To wit a delicate trench in nude and blush with a full skirt or a grouping made up of panels of various shapes shades and opacity The latter were some of the collections loveliest pieces  With their generous volumes and polished brand of eccentricity Noyess clothes are sure to find fans among women who arent afraid of a flounce or a bold sleeve But that sensibility also gave way to plenty of versatile styles to round out the collection The designer has a real talent for feminine riffs on suiting Look no further than her windowpane cropped flares and slouchy blazer for evidence of that Shirting likewise was an emphasis tailored poplin pieces served as a counterpart to Noyess balloon-sleeved shifts and sculptural skirts There was a certain innocence heresome of it intentional and some you imagined a by-product of the newness of the line that made you keen to see whats next for Audra$$Bali or bust Awaveawakes Spring 16 collection served as a lush testament to time spent on the Indonesian island Designer Jaclyn Hodes didnt lose sight of her mo of organically luxe styles or allow the trip to set her adrift on a sea of the tangential Instead like last seasons Jaipur-hued outing it served as a lens through which to subtly reinterpret all the things that have earned her label its following the languid bias-cut slip dresses and the tops and skirts made for layering (informed by Hodess work as a stylist) There was plenty of lightness to be had here The substantial-feeling lushness of washed silk charmeuse has long been a hallmark of Awaveawake but in the interest of retail in the warmer months Hodes diffused her signature material with styles in easy-to-wear easy-to-care-for cotton Elsewhere Falls hardy cowl-neck sweatshirt came to feminine new life in a floral lace The designers clothes have an undeniably earthy even holistic quality to them but with sophistication to spare To wit Springs apron dress with its lithe body-skimming shape and plunging back With pieces like that shell make a sensualist out of every one of us yet$$On a flight not long ago Babyghost designers Joshua Hupper and Qiaoran Huang seated separately both watched Ultrasuede The Halston documentary set their minds to the idea of making a Spring collection in homage to the great man Still Hupper says the two were fully aware of their potential to get overzealous so rather than going full-throttle Studio 54 this season they asked themselves What if we were trying to do this Halston collection for the Gap That idea didnt necessarily come through so much in the final product (Babyghosts clothes have plainly too much of a point of view and too much idiosyncrasy to channel Gap in any palpable way) but it seemed to serve them well Despite the season this was a deliciously Goth-y lineup light in feel if not in reference The duo was inspired by Death Clarence E Flynns poem personifying the Big Sleep as a friendly force (Why do you fear me it begins I am your friend) So much so in fact that it came stitched in its entirety along with an elegiac-looking depiction of Death on sheer tops and frocks Most beautiful of all was on the transparent front panel of a twill skirt the undersides of its seams came dappled with gold lam spots in a nod to Halston The designers resisted other direct 70s references in favor of that and the transparent confetti-filled (thats Studio 54 natch) buttons on a printed shirt All those were nice feats unto themselves but still Babyghosts most commendable move this season was one of self-awareness Hupper We want to make clothing [girls] want not clothing we want them to wear That meant wisely continuing to pare back the disparate graphic elements that have characterized Babyghost in seasons past in favor of bewitching more basic pieces The pair also debuted a lower-priced range dubbed Stashhouse (muse stylist and Babyghost international playgirl Xiao Wen Ju was wearing one of the bombers at last nights presentation) It was the kind of strong effort that left you if not undaunted by the reaper keen to see what next season will bring$$Buenos Aires of the 50s Mark Badgley and James Mischka may have never made it there themselves having been born several years too late but the red carpet stalwarts imagined that milieu through a romantics lens as the basis of their Spring lineup From the suntanned skin that the designers said informed a blush-heavy palette to the butterflies and flora here was a depiction of BA straight out of some dreamy tourist brochure Idealized but never kitsch the pair embraced their prcis wholeheartedly integrating it into the labels classic silhouettes beautifully tailored by day and very sensual and elegant by night as Mischka put it backstage pre-show The tailoring came to life with a swingy warm-weather tweed shorts suit the nighttime mood in a hothouse-looking floral lace gown and a metallic brushstroke jacquard Backstage the designers offered that while their autumnal fabrics skew toward the more heavily encrusted here was a relatively breezy profusion of frothy lightweight tulles chiffons and georgettes Gold foil butterflies on a blush tulle gown had a certain heady charm to them Still generally Badgley and Mischkas simplest propositions spoke the loudest to wit the plunging ivory top and gold beaded trousers or a little caped black cocktail dress with a waterfall of bugle bead strands that cascaded down the back Though if youre looking for an everyday shift for the office well    look elsewhere Our day starts at 5 pm Mischka laughed backstage while Helen Mirren sitting front row called out an unapologetically glam strapless gown in white and metallic gold floral jacquard as her most coveted look$$There was a buzz at todays Baja East show Common Miguel and Mariska Hargitay were seated front row and while the brands shows have historically been well attended since its inception (just two years ago) there was a noticeably higher showing of the industrys top faces For Spring designers Scott Studenberg and John Targon reimagined their signature urban nomad through the lens of rave down to the polished take on kandi seen at models wrists and necks Where the past has seen the Baja East palette go sun-bleached and spare todays was a veritable riot of parrotlike shades red chiefly but saturated blues and greens too Those all came to life in a punchy tie-dye print (weve seen a rash of the stuff at the shows already but none so graphic as this take) spotted on silk caftans That print was mirrored in the many many multicolored bingo granny bling Swarovski crystals covering white sweatshirts and tees There was also a terrific multihued crochet dappled with iridescent sequins Backstage pre-show Studenberg said that ambisexual brand or not roughly 90 percent of Bajas business is womens As such starting with Resort the designers have been increasing their focus on proper womens clothesthat is to say less loungy pieces to complement those cashmere ponchos Here that yielded a tuxedo-style ivory dress with a knotted belt that came scattered in more Swarovski There was even soft tailoring in the form of a scarlet blazer with a slim shawl collar Bajas fortunes look promising Theyre CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists in key doors globally and a growing name within the industry Now Studenberg and Targon are in the market for a key investor The heightened commercial appeal of todays outing was a step toward that and from the looks of it the designers feel good about their odds Both they and their models took a post-show victory lap dancing all the way$$Alexander Wangs three-year stint at Balenciaga is over He went out dancing snapping selfies and twirling down the runway His swan song was the freest of any of the collections he did for the house and the most tender All in shades of ivory All paraded softly out on lace slippers All in soft natural fabrics like linen cotton and voile with gentle furling edges It looked effortless where the ones that preceded it felt effortful  Work began on this collection after the announcement was made that Wang and Balenciagas parent company Kering would not be renewing his contract At the time Wang said hed be refocusing his attentions on his signature label Maybe that awareness loosened him up Maybe he really hunkered down determined to go out on a high note Whichever its no small irony that his last and best collection for the brand was the one that was truest to his own bred-in-California sensibilities A remix of The Notorious BIGs iconic Going Back to Cali played on the soundtrack Bella Heathcote Riley Keough Zo Kravitz and other Hollywood friends of his with normal-sized not overly thin bodies grounded the show in reality Loungewear was at its soul with boxer shorts peeking above waistlines and bra tops exposed under quilted jackets  As relaxed as its vibes were a good deal of work went into the collections smocking ruching and ladder stitching and yet it remained light When you know its your last anything you say Lets take a risk what do you have to lose Wang said backstage At a house thats known for innovation I thought Lets think about it the opposite way lets think about fabrics and shapes that feel supple and simple but approach them in an artisanal couture way  Following Nicolas Ghesquire the innovator Wang was referring to had to be one of the toughest jobs in fashion As Wang sped back down the runway tonight he nearly tripped over one of the shows reflecting pools before catching himself and continuing backstage It was a pointed image His own show was bigger than ever and one of the highlights of the New York calendar The question isnt how Wang will fare now but how Balenciaga will pick up the momentum again$$There was a glint of genius in Pablo Coppolas context-setting question for this collection which ran What will the bourgeois woman in 20 years time want to wear Why genius Well the bourgeois woman of today is wearing a 90s-touched but 70s-heavy constellation of signifiers upgraded by the appropriation of post-sportswear streetwear So it follows that a woman 20 years on will wear something heavily touched by whatever hindsight dictates is nowright nowin 2015/16 shot through with a lot from the 90s and made relevant by technology and trends

retrospection and push on into Where We Really Are The essence of Now So did he  It would of course be impossible to be truly sure but this didnt look like a bad bet A double-breasted shirtdress full length in heavy silk crepe bore the six-buttoned imprint of functions pastabout as useful as an appendix yet reassuring somehowin a fundamentally minimal garment The cream suiting had a flecked rustication to its finishCoppola said the intention had been to ape the raggedness of a toile but made ready-to-wear Not in the lookbook but well worth a look were silk-mix bombers in olive and blush pink with cutely pop-openable backs to flash the spine that ideally genderless post fourth-wave feminism erogenous zone There were foulard prints and hand-finished fringing and suspiciously perfect

entrance to his Hotel Intercontinental venue today Without Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West in the front row the scene inside was much more subdued than last season Rousteings own social media fame may not be at the level of the Kardashian clan but when it comes to designers few can touch him Only Jeremy Scott and Riccardo Tisci come close  His online following made him an ideal candidate for the H&M collaboration going on sale next month a point Rousteing made explicit in his notes While this 15-minute presentation is designed to create strong impressions and reactions its during the upcoming six months when the designs will make their mark Social medias embrace of Balmain will provide us with daily reminders of the excitement of those who have found a new way to bypass traditional gatekeepers Implicit in that statement was a riposte to his fashion-world detractors of which there will likely be many after todays show  Rousteing toned down the color this season to focus on shades of nude but there was no equivalent dialing-back of the embellishments that have weighed down his recent collections The macram was as full-on as ever and often in crystals or beads and the tiered ruffles were even more flamboyant than last seasons silk pliss Those ruffles notwithstanding the silhouette was super clingy loaded with cutouts and sheer paneling and cinched with waist trainersize belts Joan Smalls slithered down the runway in short stretchy green suede the shows best look but the restrictive tight-fitting tube skirts gave other models problems As excessive as it all came off at todays show these clothes look great in pictures Rousteings macram really resonates on a tiny iPhone screen the proof is in the Spring 16 outfits Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid wore last night on the town in Paris #BalmainBooties and #BalmainBeauties temporarily replaced #BalmainArmy as Rousteings hashtag du jour Who needs gatekeepers The guys going to sell millions at H&M$$Creative director Marissa Webb is pushing Banana Republic in a new direction meaning revamped patterns and new textures for both womenswear and menswear In another important switch-up for the label this collection also represented BRs first partnership with the CFDA via a collaboration with New York designer Timo Weiland and partners Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang All the changes were noticeable For womenswear Webb refreshingly shook up her pattern palette with a polished cream jumpsuit which came in a blotted watercolor floral print A pair of wide-leg trousers striped in white and aqua offered a subdued cool There was also a look in biting pink scale hues that caught the eyea striped salmon topper thrown over a lavender pleated frock But it was Webbs focus on suiting that packed an understated and chic punch without a deliberate changed-up feel An off-white slouchy jacket and trouser set as well as a jacket that was rendered into a vest were both casual enough to be worn as separates with jeanssomething that Webb was also aiming for  Likewise suiting received a makeover when it came to menswear A manicured downtown approach was seen in a dandy-style shorts suit with a fitted double-breasted jacket that included a pocket square For a more relaxed look there was also a suede jacket paired with knee-skimming shorts   One of the most refreshing additions came with Weilands work There was an uptown elevation and a glossy take on prep that could translate for BR consumers outside of Weilands metropolitan home base His riff on cocktail wear was great a high-waisted wide-pleated salmon skirt paired with a cropped tank and a sharp chambray shift dress It was a good way for BR to infuse a dose of authentic city-side cool while also introducing new talent to the traditional customer$$There is that rock n roll side and a sexy suita little bit boyish you know Its what I love to do gushed Barbara Bui air-kissing German photographer Ellen von Unwerth backstage at her Spring show today And if its what Barbara loves to do then its what Ellen loves to photographsexy uncomplicated clothes that do double-time as a flamboyant urban wardrobe for the jet set or perhaps those aspiring to join it Underscored as a love letter to Bianca Jagger Buis Spring collection traced a racy through line going from urban tailored separates (safari-tinged shirtdresses and city shorts or their romper equivalents) to wrapped bra tops and leggings all cut in supple leather Her material of choice channeled a retro lan when patchworked as a harlequin snakeskin suit or an 80s shock in hot pink napa It would take little imagination to picture a young Jagger poolside in the former option or one of the seasons silk slipdresses trapped by sculpted corset belts at the waist their plunging necklines revealing bikinis beneath Later Bui took a gaucho trip involving fringed ponchos in tan or aubergine suede for a South American theme that evolved into silk fringed eveningwear the designer called night owl embroidery (a suit and gown were positively festooned with the stuff) Those pieces swung past begging for serious dance-floor real estate but its probably the no-fuss sex appeal of Buis daywear that will lure her ladies in Hell for leather if you will$$Strong Absolutely Serene No diggity But can minimalism ever be sexy While thats a pretty subjective questioneverythings something to someoneon the whole youd think nope Minimalisms (putatively) intellectual commitment to distillation of form and austerity of delivery is just too cold to be hot Yet today sometimes that was sort of what Barbara Casasola was pitching for in this collection And impressively she sometimes sort of succeeded My woman is very sensual she said post-show and thats what I do is about Her baseline daywear proposition starred loosely languid tailoring (smashing jackets) finely rendered silk bowling shirts and some comely high-waisted silk pants that had the puckered texture of paper splashed with water and left to dry again The hot stuff was a more ambitious series of fitted dresses and jumpsuits cast in polyester-spiked pliss taffeta and textured knit silk Although mostly either monochrome or day-spa dark rusty-neutral in tone Casasola variously oomphed them up with Bardot necklines grids of tiny incisions cutaways at the abdomen or lines of larger welts in the material that ran down the side of her outfits from shoulder to hem to achieve what the press notes coyly termed a fragile reveal Casasola rather short-circuited this interplay between inhibition and abandon with a section that beachily whispered of her Brazilianness most notably in a roughly woven full-length green skirt partnered with an (unreliable) bandeau and gleaming gold totem jewelry This designer spent a few years at Roberto Cavalli and although she correctly observed that his and her aesthetics are very differentoh yesshe learned enough from the old devil to make this an at-times-effective exercise in date-night minimalism$$An eight-day trip to England proved fertile ground for Barbara Tfank who based her Spring 2016 collection called My Journey on the various sites she visited on her travels Tfank and her husband were invited to lunch by a deputy speaker of the House of Lords and the designer had a chance to visit the storied hall at the Palace of Westminster I was so taken by the decor and these perfectly maintained 19th-century roomsthe ornateness of the wall treatments the moldings and the fabrics said Tfank That lent itself organically to Tfanks textile-centric design sensibility There were plenty of brocades tinged with metallic embroidery that would have looked just spiffy in an 1800s-era sitting room Of course thats not always an ideal thing Theres a reason the palace is considered a historical site and some of Tfanks creations came off a tad antiquated an impression not helped by the upswept retro hairstyle Her inspiration translated best on a pink-and-green brocade column gown with a back panel a dress that reminded one of the kind of chintz curtains of the era and yet still somehow managed to feel fresh Also fresh a handful of evening separates including a full brocade skirt with contrasting leather waistband styled with a crop top that might entice some younger customers$$Every season we pick a destination but this time its Southern California Los Angeleswere staying right here Lubov Azria in gray post-summer NYC thusly granted a final blissfully warm day with her BCBG Max Azria lineup Surf skate musicthe ways California changed the world but a new proposal  First things first More than a few front-rowers were Snapchatting (though with limited cell service inside Moynihan Station) the patchwork bucket hats Yes Azria has made the bucket hat cool again Below the toppers it was all layers like embroidered vests lightweight knits tie-dyed T-shirts and floor-dusting pants some in twilight-hued blocked gradients Ventura with polish and smart styling  At points there was even a hint of Burning Man among all the Coachella such as in the case of a metallic gold jacquard jacket That may have been inspired by the Pacifics bronze glow on one of Azrias marathon training runs through Toluca Lake With platform cutout-toe boots cozy bits like knit leg warmers and a few great beach dresses it felt good to soak up the sun one last time$$When there are two designers who run a labellet alone two siblingsyou cant help but wonder how often they clash behind the scenes For Beaufilles Parris Gordon and Chlo Gordon sisterly disagreements are inevitable but their unique lifelong bond also makes them ideal collaborators Chlo whose background is in textiles knows which knits or tech fabrics will work best with Parriss hardware and jewelry (Parris studied metalsmithing) and vice versa From there the collection sort of unfolds organically and Spring was particularly harmonious In the past we would think of really specific inspirations and start there but now we kind of work backward Parris explained Were working more intuitively Of Spring 16s sharp lines silver ring cutouts and high-tech materials she said We immediately thought it looked retro-futuristictheres a Star Warsin-the-70s quality That mood came through best in a mid-length ivory slip dress with D-rings and trailing ribbons at the shoulders Slips are a huge trend for Spring but theyve been a Beaufille best-seller for a few seasons now Elsewhere the ring details became more prominent creating pockets of air on a sleeveless jacket or dotting the curved edge of a dress Cropped flares with chunky zippers also stood out both the rust suede and black jersey varieties would give your favorite jeans a run for their money In addition to that minimal sculptural theme there was an emphasis on more artisanal details like a one-shoulder top that looked like it was made of tangled threads Chlo handmade it by throwing bundles of yarn into water-soluble bags pinning the strings together and embroidering them over and over for hours at a time Then she dunked the mass in a bathtub and watched the bags dissolve so all that was left was the manipulated fabric Consider it a modern take on lace or crochetwith just a touch of high tech$$How better to purge any lingering associational residue of Belstaffs first luxury womenswear iterationwhich was just too hard uptight and uptown to be consistent with this free-wheeling biker brands identitythan with a vigorous salt wash Delphine Ninous dappled this collection with a seascape print that featured on jacquard turtlenecks reversible double-layer organza and shiny nylon bombers and the opening asymmetrical silk dress She had been thinking of the ocean and the elements and so forth she said This set the tone for a concerted exercise in softening through gentle erosion Field jackets bore the utilitarian hoo-ha of military taping and poachers pockets but on treated linen or a silky featherlight technical material worn over an earthy oatmeal Guernsey The biker was recast in jersey-bonded stretch suede a really impressive fabrication with shoulder guards and small-of-the-back corrugations in lightly crackled leather Matching pants too There was a sleeveless hybrid of dress and coat decorated with the neckline quilting hardware and leather strapping of Ninouss materialswhich made for quite a muster of references The designer confessed that a significant part of her role is to investigate this amazing archive of DNA from Belstaff and think Okay how can I tweak it but she is also empowered sometimes to roam off-road After all there was nothing biker in her wide lace-paneled white cotton pants or in the fine entwined peep-toe sandals orstrapping apartin the loose linen striped overcoats And thats all for the good Incorporating house codes makes a fine starting point but from there on its time to take off$$Bernhard Willhelms latest collection was totally bananas Literally Bananas were Willhelms inspiration this season and his clothings key motif There were embroidered banana designs elaborated with loops of fringe a print of a man eating a banana three-dimensional banana appliqus and more The bananas were ludicrousnot to mention suggestivewhich was precisely Willhelms point The designer was celebrating randomness in this ostentatiously cheerful outing which featured lots of sliced and distressed square-cut clothes and zero instances of the color black  Willhelm was being playful but his is serious play To engage with his clothes means engaging with the idea that people could dress in a way far removed from what we see on the street today The naivet of his methodsthe knotting and slashing and seemingly improvisational drapingas well as his touches of applied damage like dip-dye or shredded hems all together suggested a uniform worked out spontaneously by a lost tribe of club kids who had decided to make a society of their own from scratch In said society gender is a nonissueyou wear what you likeand it just so happens that one of the members of this new utopia is a master maker of intarsia knits with access to hand-embroiderers in India and placement printers in Japan Which is a roundabout way of noting that Willhelms clothes may look bananas but the designer himself is not Theres both method and sophistication to his madness$$The Betsey Johnson show is always an over-the-top extravaganza an unhinged get-together and a wild culmination of many inspirations Today there was another raging party backstagea clamor of models in sky-high heels and bass-thunking raps by Azealia Banks But though Johnson was in her vivacious element she still paid attention to some serious themes the 73-year-old designer pulled out a tank top with an American flag on it that she designed in 2001 Its for 9/11 Ive saved it all these years she said Im going to wear it for the fireman After all Johnson has seen a lot in her time as a designerand today was also a celebration of her 50 years in the fashion industry On top of that there was a point person she had to thank as well Two hours before the show Johnson arranged a car to pick up her 94-year-old dance instructor Ann Pimm to attend the show Ive dedicated the show to her said Johnson I studied with her forever and she brought me to New York to study With dance as the theme as well as her five decades of experience in the industry Johnson squeezed half a century onto the runway The first looks were set in the present with Nicki Minajesque pieces like a bubblegum corseted tutu dress on top of a neon blue net shirt As for the 90s Johnson gave grunge a playful riff with rose-patterned tutu dresses fastened with blue corsets paired with cherry print tights There was also the rock attitude of the 80s which included jumpsuits with punchy pinstripes and a very cool plastic jacket outfitted with zippers on the sleeves  But it was the 60s that introduced the most wearable looks There was a strong Twiggy influence in a mod-style Mandarin-collar striped pantsuit as well as a polka-dotted minidress with an oversize collar and sleeves Baring some skin there was a slinky violet dress with the naval-skimming dcolletage opening bound by mini bows The last looks which hailed from the 50s were the most sentimental Johnson designed the pieces based on her original dance costumes as a child There were charming nude leotards adorned with mini frills at the waist and striped with sequins as well as a bedazzled red crop top and a pleated miniskirt For the grand finale before Johnson did her traditional cartwheel she handed Pimm a bouquet of flowers Then she was followed by models in leotards printed with American flags proving that the designer always remembers the important things$$Im a very emotional designer Bibhu Mohapatra said before his Spring 2016 show Whether its a fabric or a material or an artisan story I hold on to them until it feels right As a counterpoint to last season when Mohapatra was mourning the loss of his father the designer wanted this collection to be much more spirited and celebratory He chose as his muse Annemarie Schwarzenbach a woman who has long held his fascination and whom the designer felt embodied the joie de vivre of the collection Schwarzenbach was a trailblazera glamorous and itinerant journalist and photographer who was known for her singular androgynous style in 30s Europe But she also died young at the age of 34 She had a short but very impactful life and thats something to be celebrated said Mohapatra Instead of riffing on Schwarzenbachs menswear-influenced personal stylewhich would have strayed too far from the brands core aestheticMohapatra instead opted to infuse his feminine and sophisticated silhouettes with elements of Bauhaus the school of art that Schwarzenbach subscribed to Mohapatra beautifully captured that modernist and geometric style in his prints many of which were inspired by discarded Bauhaus drawings Highlights included a warped circle print that repeated itself on tops and dresses and an overblown multicolored design iridescent with sequins that appeared on dresses and pants Elsewhere Mohapatra incorporated elements of the schools architectural aesthetic Thigh-high slits were effectively updated by squaring off the opening at the topa nice graphic touch Dresses and tops had structure and often were sliced to reveal surprising panels of tulle and silk organza Mohapatra is also emotionally invested in the fabrics he uses and the artisans he works with The designer could barely suppress his excitement backstage when showing a jacket constructed from thin strips of leather and silk that was hand-woven in Laos Surprisingly delicate and fascinating to look at up close the fabrication was certainly worth the fuss$$In the wake of founder Johan Lindebergs departure back in May BLK DNM has opted to move forward without appointing a successor instead leaving design duties up to the studio team Lindebergs vision for the brand has left them a concrete aesthetic vernacular to be built upon Spring 16 marks his last season a collection handled in part by him and in part by the in-house talents Here Lindebergs chief preoccupationsfreewheeling 60s and 70s rock n roll sensibilities quintessentially embodied by everyone from Keith Richards and Gram Parsons to Patti Smithcame to life in wearable 21st-century ways  There was plenty of common ground between this and the seasons menswear offering and why not Chances are the BLK DNM girls beau dresses as well as (if not better than) she does Consider a whiskey-color jacket decked out in yards of fabulous shuddering fringe that same fabrication came to life as a sweet Jane Birkinesque shift too Quiet touches like pony beads spotted dangling off the zips of a leather jacket were proof that the devil is in the detailsand that those details add appeal that goes a long way in setting BLK DNMs takes on well-trod iconic pieces apart from the pack Likewise tailoring has always been a strong suit of the lines and the revival of an old silhouettethe terrific shawl-collar Blazer 32could scarcely be more timely Not long before the launch of this collection Kendall Jenner was spotted out and about in a vintage iteration of the style$$A house fondness for bloom-bordered sheerness makes Blumarine a show thats relished by the bawdy band of runway photographersits their Friday morning double espresso Outside the pit however that emphasis on garlanded nudity can feel unsettlingly anachronistic Yet to be understood Blumarine needs first to be examined in terms of its anthropology Anna Molinaris line reflects an Italian sensibility a Chi magazine (Italy's answer to Us Weekly) reader's raunch-touched interpretation of ethereal romance that Blumarine fueled by its original success in knitwear manufacturing gave rise to  And the audience at todays show was ample evidence that this constituency is still in fine fettle Thus the screen-print stemmed-rose-silhouette tulle skirts shirts and gowns sometimes monochrome sometimes in a reduced-rainbow palette accented with stripes A jacket of pastel-sequined camouflagedesigned to help you blend out of the backgroundwas worn over a flower-appliqud silk smock in violet beach stripe and some superwide cut-at-the-side pink Bengal-stripe pants Those pants pointed to the unexpected element in this lineup Just as Rodolfo Paglialunga did for his debut Jil Sander collectionSpring 201512 months ago team Blumarine turned to the completely fabulous androgynous-dressing progenitor Swiss photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach for its thematic inspiration Schwarzenbach very much is a now-appropriate cipher and the interpretation of her here was expressed in high-cut loosely pocketed hardware-shorn field jacketbiker hybridsand those pants This was Blumarines nod to gender fluidity and along with the masculine accent of that Bengal stripe it reflected a sincere effort to flavor the house cocktail with a fresh dose In chambray especially and black satin up to a point it kind of convinced Although the photographers were disappointed$$Julianne Moore wore a Le Smokingstyle jumpsuit by Bosss Jason Wu at the Toronto International Film Festival last weekend She looked fantastic The strapless black jumpsuit reappeared on the runway this afternoon but its formality meant it was an outlier in Wus new collection for the German brand Now in his fourth runway season hes focused on growing the Boss universe To do so he focused mostly on daywear of the decidedly breezy variety for Spring  To start he gave the Boss suit a makeover elongating the jacket hacking off the sleeves and adding fringe to the lapels full trousers were cropped above the ankle The tailoring felt airier than his previous work here and freer even when the jackets had full sleeves The same goes for his dresses Who knows why but Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have emerged as a significant New York trend not only on the runways but also on the street Wu used them to winning effect cutting delicate sleeveless dresses in bright shades of flame red cobalt and lemon yellow organza Their split skirts and handkerchief hems swirled weightlessly as they came down the runway Until now Wu has avoided prints at Boss Giving them a go today he experimented with an etched gray-tone floral It felt a bit anemic side by side with the Bauhaus colors of the pleated dresses A pair of sheaths in a two-tone woven tweed with frayed edges were bolder All in all an assured outing$$The great outdoors was calling this morning at Bottega Veneta Its Indian summer here in Milan and everyone working in the city is trying to hold on to that serene vacation mood while the sunshine lasts So is Tomas Maier it seems as he showed a collection inspired by big country open air trekking and sailing The farther he can get from an urban environment he says the better it gets With the exception of teenagers most everybody can relate to that impulse and Bottega Veneta has never been for the underage anyway Maiers self-appointed task is to get inside the desires of women with money to spend and for Spring he is persuading them to crave more casual clothes He opened with looks evolved from tracksuits with zippered jackets and cropped pants throughout his daywear he wove a brownish-green camouflage theme patched in with leopard print On the feet flat loafers thong sandals and clogs Still theres no avoiding the fact that Bottega Venetas customers must eventually face the city and its various social occasions So for the urban jungle there was a tailored pantsuit and blouse printed in Maiers abstract camo patternnot exactly designed for merging into the background but rather for standing out from the herd as a bold fashion-adopter (printed pantsuits have been head-turners at Gucci Versace and Roberto Cavalli too) There was one intricately pieced red leather and python coat and several patchworked shift dresses that radiated the kind of highly crafted exclusiveness Bottega Veneta fans love What do you do when you want to bring a sense of the big outdoors to party dresses though Maiers solution frocks in techno-cottons ingeniously wrapped and grommeted with slim guy-ropes as shoulder straps They werent exactly tents but some of them had that feeling about them Maybe for a woman whod secretly rather spend her summer nights under the stars$$Tatiana Maslany the Canadian star of Orphan Black wore an ivory Le Smoking by Bouchra Jarrar to the Emmys last month Admittedly there wasnt much in the way of competition but she was easily among the chicest women at the ceremony elegant where other actresses looked try-hard or just plain wrong Its nice to see Hollywood waking up to Jarrars red carpet potential shes putting a new emphasis on dress-up clothes at her couture shows For ready-to-wear presented in her premier arrondissement atelier which is becoming increasingly crowded as the seasons progress shes focused on a more everyday kind of elegance  In a first for Jarrar there was a tailored pantsuit in a dark-rinse denim the softness of which defied expectations Softness was truly the order of the day be it a caramel-color shrunken leather blouson and matching skirt with an arching slit or a navy viscose trench with a high storm flap and epaulets But Jarrar was equally concerned with the collections graphic punch juxtaposing the high-contrast animal print of an elongated gilet with the black lace of a long-sleeved top or piecing together a sexy asymmetrical tank top with patent shoulder straps from diagonal slices of tech fabric and leather We cant help circling back around to her smoking jackets though Does anyone anywhere cut one better$$For a first-time designer Brandon Maxwell knows what hes doing With the uptown location of Mr Chow as his show venue and a guest list so edited every name read as a Who's Who of the fashion world Maxwell had the odds stacked in his favor at his premiere New York Fashion Week presentation That says nothing of the fact that he joins the design community as Lady Gagas longtime stylist who has covered magazines arm in arm with the singer and who calls Gaga's frequent collaborators Steven Klein Alexander Wang and Inez and Vinoodh his friends Then there was Gaga herself perched front row in one of his designs cheering on models as they walked by and breaking into tears of joy as the finale gowns brushed passed her In a season where designers are striving for intimate personal settings Maxwell truly nailed it  But what of the clothes With power women as his starting point Maxwell sent out sharply tailored separates in black ivory and a dusty rose culminating in several over-the-top gowns Nearly every look featured some element of ridged pleating a motif derived from Maxwells childhood practice of dressing up his sisters in bed sheets and fastening them with his fathers cummerbunds The effect worked best when it was used minimally like on the lapels of second-skin dinner jackets or around the waist of tailored trousers A high-neck white wrap dress and black billowy-sleeved frock edged into costume territory the sort of things that could only be pulled off by someone with a commanding presence to rival Gagas For those looking for just a touch of diva wed recommend the cut-to-there minidress on Ophelie Guillermand Sexy without question but a little better suited for off-stage activities$$Brock Collection is still a relatively young label but husband-and-wife duo Kris Brock and Laura Vassar have already established their signatures Theyre proponents of an unfussy femininity thats rooted in luxe fabrics and simple silhouettes Brocade in particular is a Brock staple its appeared in every collection thus far from midi-length skirts to billowing floor-grazing shirtdresses For Spring the textures were even more opulentsee the hand-embroidered cotton dresses and ivory python pencil skirt Those items took elevated daywear to an entirely new place Brock and Vassars point of view is more about subtle flourishes than specific themes but they did cite architecture as an influence We designed the collection while we were living at my parents house which my mom designed Vassar explained at their peaceful High Line Room presentation Its all Gustavian and Swedish style so its really simple and beautiful with clean lines So we were thinking a lot about restraintI think its harder to restrain yourself than it is to go overboard Where they could have added more structure or embellishment to their garments they held back One of the best examples of this philosophy was actually made up of two classics a striped shirt that extended to the floor (and could also be worn as a dress) layered over cropped jeans Mixing in those casual humble textures is another Brock signature ensuring the clothes feel special but not precious These were luxurious pieces meant to be worn in your real life a point that was highlighted by the models footwear Each look was paired with flat python sandals a new category for the designers Heres hoping Brock bags are next$$The charm of irregularity is how Brunello Cucinelli described the spirit of his Spring collection a lineup of fluid shapes in creamy whites where raw textures took center stage Inspired by the elegant beach resorts of the Annes Folles and the sophisticated yet dgag style of the decadent elites of that era who holidayed in Deauville and Biarritz the style was relaxed and soft with a subtle retro feel A touch of modernity was added through references to the Japanese love of organic materialstheir traditional streamlined minimal lines and sophisticated cutting techniques Embracing imperfections is a fascinating concept because it mirrors nature and the flow of life itself said a dapper Cucinelli pointing out sweaters knitted with raw hemp dusters cut from buttery-soft raw silk and cardigans in corrugated yet supersoft yarns Pants were the foundation of the collection which despite the exotic visual inspiration was rooted in practicality and wearable day looks Ankle-grazing culottes were gathered and softly pleated at the waist a wraparound skirttrouser hybrid looked modern Paired with a pearl gray shaved mink sleeveless top it added a touch of luxe to the lineup Jackets were elongated and masculine with a relaxed feel due to the use of ultra-lightweight fabrics Garonne-style cardigans recalled the sophisticated insouciance and the sporty elegance of the 20s but were given the signature Cucinelli treatment Crafted with raw precious fibers they were deconstructed to achieve a sort of chubby yet fluid effect Id like my style to be extremely versatile day-to-night ageless timeless perfect for women of all ages and sizes he enthused Case in point His elegant wife and their two young daughters were on handand all looking at ease clad in head-to-toe Cucinelli$$Burberry's heritage might be centuries old but Christopher Baileys vision for the brand is relentlessly forward-thinking Twenty-four hours before the lights went up on the Burberry Prorsum runway a sneak peek of the collection was staged on Snapchat Having recently announced a partnership with Apple Music it seems the CEO and chief creative is forging ahead with other tech and sound alliances too and attendees of todays show were treated to a mini concert by Alison Moyet a video of which will be launched exclusively with the music-sharing service Performing with a 32-piece orchestra Moyets ethereal vocals set the darkly romantic tone of the show and the first model was dressed in head-to-toe blacka thigh-grazing lace minidress classic trenchcoat sporty rubber-soled sandals and a nylon backpack That mishmash of techy sportswear and delicate vintage-inspired eveningwear was cut with militaristic details throughout Peacoats came studded with brass Sgt Pepperstyle regimental buttons and slinky satin silk skirts were finished with metallic cording of the kind you might find on a soldiers uniform In fact they were made by the same embroiderers that decorate the coats of the Queens Guard just a stones throw away at Kensington Palace Clearly homegrown production values are still on the agenda and much of the lace was made in the UK too Bailey never fails to keep the bigger picture in mind though and he explained backstage after the show that for him the idea of traditional seasons has essentially become obsolete Showing those pretty 40s-inspired slips with a cozy sheared mink coat as well as light summer trenchcoats makes sense in a global market  And speaking of slip dressinga trend that has been inescapable on both sides of the pondKate Moss the woman who took the look to the world stage in the 90s was sitting in the front row next to Londons current reigning cool girl Cara Delevingne With a social media following in the millions the model turned actress has an enormous sphere of influence The counterintuitive styling of the show where a hoodie and a bias-cut silk dress can happily coexist in the space of one look had modern verve and spoke to the kind of #OOTDs that live in her Instagram feed After the Internet frenzy for Burberrys Fall 2015 monogrammed blanket the brands new nylon backpack which was embroidered with Delevingnes initials and sat in her lap today is likely to go viral just as quickly$$For several seasons a visit to the Cacharel showroom has been prefaced with the same party line about rediscovering the brand heritage and modernizing it for today And its tough to take umbrage with clothes that are intentioned unchallenging and more often than not patterned in flowers Aside from a venue change to new well-appointed headquarters on the Left Bank not much has changed Which is not necessarily a criticism The lookbook shot by millennial photographer Alexandra Sophie refers to the Cacharel style as Lady 20 a catchall that neatly encompasses the signature drop-waist dresses lace polo tops and a novelty trench printed with pastel canaries Indeed the design studio continues to propose a variety of stylized florals (this time anemones poppies peonies and a vintage botanical print) alongside everyday overcoats breezy blouses and respectable skirts all corresponding in proportion and palette One update Cacharel collaborated with Notify jeans and the boyfriend styles offset the range of romantic blouses from embroidered mousseline to broderie anglaise Oh and another A stand-alone store in the French capital is scheduled to open sometime next year By then perhaps we will see a bit more originality in a way that generates excitement for a deserving brand The new office is a stones throw from the Muse dOrsay home to some of the most beautiful flower paintings ever created Just a thought$$Calvin Klein designed an era-defining collection of slip dresses for Spring 1994 The models in that showKate Moss Bridget Hall Michele Hickswent on to rule the runways for a decade and the dress became a house icon The only piece of clothing Klein might be more famous for is his instantly recognizable logo briefs Twenty-odd years later perhaps thanks to Internet-fueled nostalgia or maybe greater cultural forces contemporary designers are looking back at those early 90s days Those skimpy silk frocks were all over the New York shows this week including at Francisco Costas excellent offering for Calvin Klein Collection today  Costa is well-versed in the labels heritage but the new Calvin Klein Collection slip dresses are different from the ones of old Call it grunge deconstruction Theyre slack at the bust extra straps dangle every which way and knit versions stitched with brass chains fray and disintegrate towards the hem Costa imagined the morning after a liaison when a woman might toss her lovers tailored jacket and too-big pants over her lingerie and the tailoring too got the deconstruction treatment Pant hems unraveled jacket hems were partially sliced away and sleeves extended almost to the fingertips or were sliced up the seam halfway to the elbows It was new to see Costa embrace the disarray in the past hes erred on the side of orderly  The collections biggest surprise was the photo prints of flowers that appeared on dresses pants and a trench alike Costa doesnt usually show that much pattern on his runway Its rarer still for it to have such sweet connotations Heres hoping he indulges his romantic impulses again sometime soon$$Camilla Freeman-Topper and Marc Freeman shot the lookbook for their new collection inside Frank Gehrys recently opened paper bag building in Sydney a new wing of the citys University of Technology The buildings swirling metallic interior wasnt the inspiration for the siblings new clothes but it may as well have been This outing was all about curvilinearity refraction and controlled swoops of volume The volume story came through with greatest force in this collections trumpet-shaped sleeves and skirt hems High-necked tunics and densely knit off-the-shoulder tops with bell-like silhouettes echoed the theme and numbered among this outings standout pieces This was a notably restrained and sophisticated effort for Camilla and Marcthe froth was curtailed to diaphanous silk and velvet burnout dresses that were understated enough to sit nicely with the collections classically glam draped silk satin looks for evening The flourishes likewise erred toward a high tonesome decorous eyelash fringe a touch of metallic The sprightliest looks here were the ones that featured holographic polka dots woven into lightweight black jacquard The other graphic pop here came from Camilla and Marcs abstract print which picked up on the waves built into the collections drapes and flares The print was attractive and eye-catching but what stuck with you about this collection were the subtler effects in particular the ways that Freeman and Freeman-Topper incorporated a sense of openness and fluidity into their generally attenuated silhouettes The line was long and lean but not constricted Lots of women will appreciate that$$The Frick Collection has never opened its doors for a fashion show Over the years many designers have asked but the answer was always no This season Carolina Herrera heard yes The skylit atrium is a transporting place its Beaux Arts grandeur might have tempted Herrera to look back in time for inspiration but shes a resolutely modern-minded designer She has been quick to embrace high-tech materials and figure out ways to incorporate them into her tony uptown aesthetic This season more than ever she put them to work  On a preshow tour through her backstage dressing area the buzzword was pleats but not old-fashioned pleats Herreras are trompe loeil narrow bands of tech fabric stitched onto transparent mesh of different densities Sometimes the tulle disappeared on the skinand sheer paneling has never looked more decorous or discreet On other pieces it was thicker almost like athletic mesh creating a sporty mien The second talking point was pink Im in my rose period Herrera said From a flirty day dress (real pleats not trompe loeil) in a delicate shade of blush to an embroidered shift in raspberry suede there was no shortage of the shade and it did a good job of warming up the somewhat clinical feel of the synthetic materials For those not predisposed to pink there were a few other frocks in black and white and a nice-looking vaguely New Look suit in midnight blue flocked velvet Herrera was eager to avoid prints because shes done them so often in the past Like we said resolutely modern-minded Still that rose-print slip dress was awfully pretty$$Alexis Martial and Adrien Caillaudaud took the ultra-gamine Carven girl on a deep-sea dive for their Spring 2016 collection exercising their ability to produce neat tailoring sporty details and the type of kicky youthful A-line silhouettes that consistently bring the ingenues running credit cards extended The story said Martial and Caillaudaud backstagewhile standing before an inspiration board posted with Corinne Days portraits of Kate Moss for The Face early female scuba divers and assorted oceanic creatureswas of a girl in search of a seaside adventure She ditches her boyfriend (but packs some of his shirts to wear with her minis) and learns to scuba dive Eventually as the looks lead into evening she goes back to the city only now shes wearing her souvenirs  And true to the narrative nautical touches on suiting and separates (eyelets as portholes) gave way to transparent logo tees paired with a Grey Gardensesque shirt-as-skirt (Because youre on the boat and you really dont care said Caillaudaud) and eventually a long and lean silhouette often centered around a narrow crepe pant anchored by a clunky sandal But while prints were derived from sea creatures (jellyfish octopuses striped puffer fish all covered in fluorescent spots and striations) and one stiff frocks frilled edges were reminiscent of undulating tentacles most of the clothesbarring at least one excellent knit which boasted dangling beaded fringelacked the movement inherent to the life aquatic favoring instead the rigid thickness of decidedly un-casual clothes Adventure after all is about freedomand even ingenues need some wiggle room$$For his Spring 2016 collection Cdric Charlier was driven to abstractionspecifically to the work of Victor Pasmore who is credited with pioneering abstract art in Britain in the first half of the 20th century Pasmore was a painter and an architect too but there was none of that kind of sculptural quality to Charliers designs which in most cases were worn away from the body hanging straight down from the shoulders or cinched at the waist by thick obi-style belts which also hung loose off the backs of some dresses trailing behind the models as they walked  Silhouette was clearly foremost in the designers mind I was really interested in this T shape Charlier explained backstage before the show tracing the trunk and shoulders of one of the model images on his run of show and it showed The shoulders were the strongest point on a majority of looks with skirts typically ending in a loose ruffle and trousers in a frayed hem The palette was predominantly neutral in shades of blush pink and peach occasionally dipping into hunter green and the fabrics were mostly natural fibersas Charlier said he wanted to stay with cotton and silk for as much of the collection as possible It was all designed for day from the boxy shirtdresses with plenty of hanger appeal to the military-style anoraks done in waxed cotton and cotton jacquard Most winning were the mixed-print patchwork dresses which felt hard and soft all at once with all of the grace of Pasmores own Roses in a Jaronly this version you can wear to your next garden party$$Its about taking her out of urban life and putting her feet on the sand Its where I long to be more and more said Phoebe Philo in her debrief about Cline as dozens of journalists jostled to shove their iPhones in her face But the background of Clineits conceptual tented setting its variety the storming briskness of her modelscannot be captured in a convenient old-school sound bite about color silhouette and theme Philo rebuilt Cline by trusting her instincts and by trusting that other women are tuned into the same wavelength And now shes getting more outspoken about it I am somebody who is interested in how clothes make us feel she said and in how we behave in different places I thought If you were traveling for a year what would you need to take with you Where were her model-avatars heading The space constructed by FOS a Danish installation artist suggested something between a festival hangout and an art biennial in a hot locale but the music was a mechanistic drumming that kept pace with the stream of girls marching swiftly and with intent shod in utilitarian ankle boots or almost-medieval woven-leather pointy flats   If anything has turned a corner at Cline since the last couple of shows its the feeling that an incipient conceptualism and eccentricity has been jettisoned Instead this was a grounded collection a sophisticates compendium giving the definitive word on wearing the 90s slip dress in pulled-together grown-up style on handling the 80s tendency with a curvy shoulder line and a Jean Paul Gaultier rib-knit waist on nodding to the milkmaid neckline with an abstracted trompe loeil corseting and on pants pants pants What with the English menswear tweedy checked suiting the wide cropped pair of trousers in extraordinarily high-shine black satin and then the olive green army parka and pants that swing out at the end Philo reminded all and sundry that this is the house that services women with the best cuts available Yet on the other hand Cline is also a dress source And here there was a full spectrum of those as well not just plunging lace-edged slips but practical workday survival looks in utititarian linen and then for evening or perhaps day-wafting on holiday long fluid jersey dresses with high-waisted bodices and chaste-medieval scooped necks A telling reaction to this collection was the instant straw poll going on among guests as they poured out of the show Asking each other what they liked best everyone had a different answer And thats the way it is today There is and should be no one look but a spectrum of equally valid looks for many of us to feel like ourselves in Phoebe Philos genius is that she holds the mirror up to that emotional reality Applause$$Does a vulnerable woman have to be weak Chris Gelinas posed that question today and with his Spring collection offered up the answer as he saw it certainly not Taking as his central motif a graphic spin on one of Irving Penns famous flowersa punchy version of a typically fragile thingGelinas toyed with different takes on the idea of controlled exposure His opening look a barely there white tank and hot pants came topped with a hardy coat in a menswear-inspired plaid Elsewhere languid dresses came with curving seams that buttoned (or unbuttoned) all the way up Gelinas noted that while his clientele of a certain age would wear them the traditional way his more directional young shopper could well opt to undo them throw on a pair of shorts and let the dresses sides fly free  The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist had some real hits on his hands with pieces like a printed blouse with slashed full sleeves (shown with another pair of hot pants) and his fabrications remain among the strongest of New York Citys young guns While impeccable textiles and techniques arent always fully appreciable on the runway Gelinass guests milled around post-show admiring the Italian blossom-print fils coup jacquard shorn and married to an underlayer of black organza and the dense all-over embroidery that gave a certain toughness to his flounced miniskirt The designer showed a similar skirt for Fall 2015 but still this collection felt a far cry from that seasons nicely austere homage to American workwear Here there was a certain albeit very modern primness you felt it in the buttoned-up shirts whittled cropped pant legs and circle skirts At times perhaps it was a bit more controlled than vulnerable you wanted to see Gelinass muse come just a bit more undone These clothes had a beautiful womanliness to them though Gelinass wholesale business is a relatively new one (he has a loyal base of private customers and now stockists that include Fivestory New York Shopbopcom and LAs Guerilla Atelier) You got the sense its only going to grow in the months to come$$Im a very curious person said Hussein Chalayan backstage Hes right about that in both senses For only an inquiring mindand a very particular attitudecould have formulated the fabulous coup de thtre at the heart of this mornings Chalayan presentation Upon entering the show space two models could be seen wearing white paper dresses with military detailing standing in some kind of glassless vitrine The audience checked them out then blanked them out They werent doing much just standing there The show proceeded As soon as the first bespoke cigar-holder pocket at the chest of an olive green military-style skirt-dress appeared it became apparent this was an extension of Chalayans most recent Cuban-themed menswear collection And indeed there were some looks from that outing sprinkled among the pliss skirts that were printed with abstracted pie charts from the CIA Factbook on Cuba the cute Plonk cartoon character Chalayan found in the British Library and transported to his muse nation and the neutral-toned dancer-and-trumpeter brocade For some reason the soundtrack was a medley of a woman moaning in suggestive ecstasy and the Knight Rider theme song unlikely bedfellows The clothes were precise and complicated and sometimes very beautiful Each model wore rope-tied shoes whose heel was an on-its-side cylinderone of these heels detached early in the show and rolled forlornly to a halt as its wearer walked on Then came the splash Those two paper-dress-wearing models tensed Two hidden showerheads above them suddenly gushed forth Andwhoathe paper dresses literally melted away as the water doused them revealing crystal-flashed palm-pattern party dresses beneath It was amazing to watch The models one of them shivering walked the runway and left a slick of water behind them Afterward the very curious Mr Chalayan explained the sleight of dress thusly That was to represent the transformation of a militant kind of situation [in Cuba] to a more playful one I liked the idea of using water Because of course Cuba theres a sea So I thought how could I fuse these ideas together And I liked the idea of a garment that could melt and reveal something else underneath And it was of course crystal embellished because our sponsor was Swarovski So we had these dancing palm trees and the crystals were their coconuts It was a real challenge to be honest A lot of back and forth Girls slipping as you saw and heels breaking but who cares I like taking risks Original curious and intelligent Chalayan is a designer to cherish$$See Chanel and fly As much as the foreign members of the audience might wish thats not quite the case since there are still 24 Paris hours to go till the Spring shows are over Still women of all nations were amused to check in ahead of time at the Chanel airport terminal Karl Lagerfeld installed in the Grand Palais It provided a funny enhanced-reality replica of a situation we all know only too well the one where we watch everyone else milling around busy on their ways with their rolling suitcases their tracksuits and contra-freeze in-flight comfort sweaters their practical flats for walking the endless corridors to baggage claim and the crucial sunglasses for the jet-lagged arrival Only of course all this is considerably upgraded Its the idea of how it should look quipped Lagerfeld It is strange to see Chanel taking over the flight controls the day after a dispute between Air France and its workers came to an ugly head over falling business and layoffs Instead here was Chanel putting the best and most globally appreciated face of France forward and laying out an array of products that will most certainly fly off the racks at duty-free and in all cities where the house has boutiques Chanel has been most careful to clock up its air miles in customer-care outreach in the past couple of years The destinations indicated on the Grand Palais departure boardSingapore Dubai Seoul Tokyoare all cities where Lagerfeld and co have taken the double-C traveling show to first-class customers And what will this well-traveled international clientele be taking onboard from this particular show Bits and pieces from all over the concourse no doubta Chanel range that runs from the witty and kitsch (Chanel hard-case wheelie carry-on bags Teva-type sandals with tweed straps and flashing runway-landing lights running around the soles) takes off in the ironic insider trophy (70s leisure jackets plane-patterned tricolor intarsia cashmere sweaters and a flash of Laura Ashleyesque puff-sleeved denim) and then lands amid sparkling splendor The twinkling herringbone jackets and shell tops paved in crystal and decorated with fat black ribbon bows are quintessentially timelessly Chanel nothing to do with noveltyyet also in their way an accessory rather than an outfit In the congested skies of fashion Captain Karl is one person who knows how to navigate Chanel in all the right directions$$The 1990s is one of Springs big stories but no one has put forward her interest in the decade more explicitly than Clare Waight Keller at Chlo On every seat there was a printed note This seasons collection is a tribute to girls named Kate Chlo Cecilia Corinne Rosemary Emma and Courtney who embody the liberty and the elegance of a perfectly mastered and excessively lived simplicity Backstage the designer explained she grew up alongside that motley crew of models photographers and superstar performers For Waight Keller they represent a freer time Theres such a fast pace to fashion now I think weve lost the innocence of the spirit of fashion the youthful optimism that it portrays And I think theres something quite joyful about fashion thats been missing  In keeping with that sentiment she imbued the new collection with a playful spirit quite literally in the case of the rave-girl tracksuit separates she started with Athleisure is something different for Chlo and it was most convincing when Waight Keller combined a split-hem track pant with a romantic off-the-shoulder shirt typical of the brand As the show progressed it took on more of those familiar Chlo tropesfestival dresses peasant tops lacy little bandeaux and miniskirtsbut never lost its 90s leanings The denim separates were oversize and frayed Overallsin trouser and dress formconjured images of raves gone by too There were even Hammer (as in MC) pants All of which will likely play exceedingly well with young women who missed out on them the first time around  Waight Keller had Georgina Grenville Cecilia Chancellor and Angela Lindvall representing the 90s in the front row but what a kick it wouldve been to see them on the runway in these clothes Youthful optimism is wasted on the young$$There were mountains of delphiniums shipped in to decorate the Dior tent and mountains of people clogging the Rue de Rivoli entrance jostling for a glimpse of Rihanna Inside though There was Raf Simons backstage talking about keeping things simple and quiet Its a calm one and very softaway from the overdone I didnt want to embellish So I was thinking about the South of Francerainbows and the simple things And theres a bit of Victoriana something of that film Picnic at Hanging Rock With a slight sexual undertone of darkness Simons can lay reasonable claim to have been the one to start both the current Victoriana-nightdress trend and the intergalactic astronaut trends that are running through so many collections this seasonhe proposed both themes in his Spring 2015 ready-to-wear show But part of the responsibility for helming a behemoth brand like Christian Dior is filling stores with daywear for women who like feminine things rather than conceptual clothes and this season he attended to servicing it  His solution was to pair scallop-edged handkerchief cotton dresses little shorts and bodices with black tailoring The jacketssoftened from the corseted New Look hourglassskimmed the body and broke into bands of micro pleats at the hem a masculine-feminine merge suggesting the techniques that went into the trains of Victorian and Edwardian dresses The sexual undertone Not so much in the clothes as at the necks which were bound with tight scarves and chokers each carrying a single jewel and dangling a metal tag some of which read 1947 the date of Diors revolutionary New Look collection In terms of fashion though there was nothing very disturbing or challenging in any of this Deliberately so In a season where many collections have apparently neglected to remember that there might be warm weather in 2016 Dior is one place where fresh summer options will be found$$The North African playground of Morocco is oft-mined territory for fashion designers Its exotic textiles and rich cultural landscape stole the heart of Yves Saint Laurent and Alber Elbaz paid homage to the ancient land (also his birthplace) for Lanvins sumptuous Fall 2015 show But fast-forward a generation or two to New York Citybased designer Christian Siriano whose Spring 2016 show mapped a fantasy road trip taking in Casablanca Marrakech Tangier and Fez through his glamorous West Coast lens It was about the dream of Morocco I researched traditional interiors and architecture including many different mosques said Siriano He stripped back the vibrant palette of the Berbers in favor of optic white blush and sandy-toned silks cut into his signature structured shifts and a slew of floaty tunics matched with pencil skirts or fluid palazzo pants Amid the flounce of handkerchief hems and cocktail dresses in body-con knit Siriano applied an intricate textural play of pom-poms fringing and a geometric tiled jacquard that reflected his inspiration with a somewhat heavy hand Later on he tipped the scales in his favor when translating those tropes into the more familiar territory of eveningwear where pleated goddess gowns and a frothy tulle pinafore injected a welcome lightness It is from those looks that Sirianos front row fixtures Christina Hendricks and Orange Is the New Black star Laura Prepon might choose their next red carpet moment a marabou-flecked ball skirt perhaps or one of the gowns encrusted in scalloped peach sequins Despite their couture touch even those showstoppers paled in comparison to four finale looks that emerged with satin trains in eye-watering pastel silksthose were the welcome color shock this collection needed from the get-go$$I wanted something very airy very light very easyand quite minimal as well said Christian Wijnants at his presentation today Well consider that job done But    hold on    presentation Wijnants has stepped off the runway He said this was a result of the opening of his first flagship store in Antwerp a project that has been dominating his time Hmm Hmmmmm Well whatever the reason the absence of a runway proved no greatly significant obstruction to the delivery of this collection Wijnants said he had been thinking about Brancusi and there was some correlation to that evident in the irregular lumpen-ness hinting at distorted symmetry in his fil coupe applications More broadly though this was an efficient but not especially uplifting compilation of contemporary fashion tropes The strongest pieces included a tightly fringed kicky jumpsuit and a blouse fronted with frayed panels of clothes that transformed the canvas pants obscured beneath them into the viable foundation of an evening look Fil coupe suiting printed with a tonal monkey relief motif frayed panel cotton viscose knit tees some linen-lined scuba-foam hot pants and fringing galore on denim-chambray separates were all fine and dandy It was interesting though how the transplantation of this collection from runway to showroom rather sucked the oomph out of it This collection was full of solidly tasteful left-field pieces but there was not a great deal to get properly excited about here$$Last season she discovered sex said Christopher Kane Now shes crazy in love Kanes work is always about who he is where he comes from and what hes experiencing at the time And some of the creative connections he makes are through language The word crazy is the one with the emotional double meaning which set him off this time Our life has been a bit of a car-crash recently he remarked in a preview at his studio He did not spell out why that is but he and his family have been dealing with the recent loss of their mother and of Christophers mentor in the past year or so Thus the imagery of car-wrecks fractured shapes jagged cutouts and spray-painting filtered into his dresses and tailoring Perhaps it was his raw state of mind that led him to look at the instinctive unfiltered nature of outsider art a train of thought that led him to apply naive hand-stitched motifs to sweaters and leather coats and to apply frayed white chiffon frills to collars and pockets Another sideways leap made Kane think about mental institutions and medical science hence the woman in the blue shirt banded with wipe-clean plastic cuffs and a strict skirt Like a nurse whos going to give you a lethal injection Belaboring explanations is never the way to understand Christopher Kane though Getting him is always a case of whether you appreciate his electric fusion of weirdness and chic There were jolts of that sort of current running through the detailsnarrow plastic restraint tags on black silk dresses worn as chokers and decorating bags a reprise of Kanes signature neon lace in even sicker combinations of orange yellow and lime and funny envelope clutches cut in the shape of cartoon explosions Fun odd and elegant by turns this was a show which covered a lot of bases No matter what life has been throwing at him it proved that Christopher Kane is a solid designer$$Ladies heres a dating tip Go out with guys like Christopher Raeburn This is an analysis based entirely on Raeburns design ethos but it doubles as a pretty good laundry list of things to look for in a man 1) Raeburn has integrity as demonstrated in his commitment to utilizing upcycled and locally sourced materials and vegetable dyes like the ones used in the silk floral prints in his latest collection 2) Raeburn is a true team player on the evidence of the two collaborations he unveiled this seasonchunky sandals made with Clarks and knits produced with the house Knyttan 3) Hes romantic yet practical Note the standout accessory at Raeburns show this afternoon a hand-tied jacquard fanny pack Nuff said Really though the main reason to go out with a guy like Christopher Raeburn is that Christopher Raeburn is as excited about the things a woman does as the way a woman looks Purely on the level of aesthetics this was by far Raeburns most compelling womenswear showhe finally got a firm handle on feminine cuts and codes But Raeburn arrived at that breakthrough courtesy of his theme an homage to intrepid female explorers that summoned both a pioneer spirit and a sense of authority For all the sheer diaphanousness of a dress in patchworked olive drab parachute silk for instance the look still communicated vigor and potency Seriously date a guy who understands that softness and strength are not opposing values Raeburn evinced that understanding again and again in these clothes There was a certain tenderness to his basket-weave fil coupes made from strips of old air-break parachute fabric and either overdyed black or left plain But Raeburn used the textile in silhouettes that were matter of fact like a wrapped tunic and long skirt or a pair of low-slung wide-leg trousers Elsewhere transparent materials or his vegetable-dyed floral print introduced that tender note Other looks had a harder more graphic edge in particular the printed gray jersey and olive drab cotton pieces but he muted the blunt effect by hewing to shapes that though tailored were relaxed Raeburn has suddenly become very good at mixing his tones and creating garments that feel multidimensional His clothes were distinctive but not defining A woman wearing them could feel utterly herself and confident about lighting out for new territory Date a guy like Christopher Raeburn Or you know what If youd rather feel free to go it alone$$The humble weed is finally getting its moment in the spotlight Inspired by their ability to survive in urban environments against all odds Rozae Nichols turned her Spring collection into what she called a celebration of the mightiness of these hard-to-kill plants and their knack for breaking their way through cracks in cement Nichols whose brand launched in 2011 quickly found success with her digital floral prints which have been stamped on a growing list of categories that now includes shoes and swimwear But this season the designer seemed to want to branch out in a new direction Her best pieceslike a color-blocked cami dress or topwerent printed at all but embellished with hand-stitched laser-cut flowers part of Nicholss aim to push her signature florals into the third dimension The palettesalmon pink with lavender dusty rose with brown navy with golden yellowlent everything a delightful jolie laide vibe Nichols has also been training her customer to seek solids from the label the cropped colorful flares will certainly further her efforts$$Co is a brand based in Los Angeles Until now though the collections that Co honchos Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern produced havent been particularly suggestive of the placetheres always been an idiomatically Californian sense of ease to Cos clothes but its been overshadowed by a tone of Old World soign (And sometimes a certain cloudy-weather moodiness too) This season however Kern and Danan took inspiration from their surroundings lightening up their collection both literally and tonally and tipping their hat to the local landscape with palm-frond motifs and fabrics that conjured a distant ocean view What Cos new materials lacked in weight they made up for in richness The lavish materials included a palm-patterned mesh jacquard a wave-textured 3-D-printed viscose and most gorgeous of all a white chiffon flecked with devor velvet A keyhole-collared maxi dress in the fabric was one of the collections understated standouts Elsewhere there were simple button-down blouses with high-drama collars tailored frocks with bouffant skirts handknit cotton sweaters and a bevy of A-line and Peter Pancollared looks that referenced high-end mod The big sellers though will be Cos expanded range of denim done in collaboration with Franois Girbaud As well as introducing new silhouettes in the raw Japanese denim currently flying out of stores Kern and Danan debuted a version of their best-selling flares in off-white cotton canvas Emboldened perhaps by the Girbaud collaborations success Co has embarked on two new ones The terrific hats in the lookbook were done in partnership with milliner Fil and the sunglasses are Co by Jacques Marie Mage Altogether the clothes and accessories made for a very Co take on LA Hollywood glam as reimagined by Truffaut or Fellini perhaps$$Stuart Vevers walks to work at Coach along the High Line every day lucky thing The aerial park with its grasses and fig trees and urban butterflies tracks across the west side of Manhattan as one of the most joyously human examples of industrial repurposing in our times The new Coach offices are under construction near the end of the High Line at 30th Street as it happens and it was adjacent to that location on a perfectly sunny September afternoon that the company invited the press buyers and celebrities to step along the old railway tracks and into a temporary grass-planted space to see the first big runway show Coach has staged for New York Fashion Week As it also happens 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Coach So said Vevers it felt like a good moment to show we have confidence The values of Coach have always been purely American and pragmatic a company proud to fulfill everyday needs But in the 21st century Vevers is one of those designers who questions how and whether that democratic ideal in fashion is reaching young people at attainable prices and in ways that will excite them His answer was to think about a magpie girl who goes on road trips picking up Western things but also might steal from her grannys closet on the Upper East Side If so granny was a bit of a 70s bohemian because this girls dresses were all made from micro-floral multicolored patchworks though they were definitely a lot shorter than they were at Woodstock and with an easily relatable pull-on-and-go attitude about them Still Vevers is not someone who will go off on narrative raptures about fictional muses Refreshingly hes a down-to-earth product designer who is good at thinking about such things as what a functional cut-down cowboy boot should look like for a customers money ie comfortable with a lot of collaged fun thrown into the bargain I dont think Ive ever put a heel on the runway at Coach he said laughing I just want to make it feel light in spirit and bring some joy to it and maybe a sense of the American outdoors It worked Coach is of course a great American bag companyand there were plenty of respectfully traditional saddle-leather hobo shapes reprised in the showbut it also needs to convert a new generation to its faith And oddly on the High Line today it felt as if Stuart Vevers an Englishman abroad is the person who might be able to see exactly how to do that$$The cult of Comme is a complicated micro-society shadowed by layers of lines within Beneath apex-Commeand what a truly incredible collection Rei Kawakubo showed this weekthere is the Comme des Garons commercial collection that never sees the light of runway but that the buyers flock to postshow Boy the showroom was rammed today Below significantly below there is Comme Shirt (kinda my favorite in terms of buy-to-wear) Comme Girl and probably several others hidden away in the Comme-citadel on Place Vendme of which most people have probably never heard Comme des Commethis collectioninhabits a welcome sweet spot between haute Comme and Girl It is the go-to uniform for Comme acolytes These are the clothes of the disciples Todays collection contained an interesting mlange of the rustic and the historical shot through with the white-and-navy overtones of seifuku (old-school Japanese school uniform lifted from French sailor suits) that seem so ingrained in the Comme unconscious The cut-away angle beneath the two buttons on a nylon/polyester jacket (CdGCdG is a master of mustering richness in synthetics) spoke loudly of early19th century military tailoringlook at portraits of Lord Nelson The rough gently pleated linen shift and smock dresses whispered of a Thomas Hardy-ish bucolic vision of the tenant farmers wife There were even pantaloons worn over the usual Repetto uwabaki This was a carefully and poignantly rendered articulation of the ascetic aesthetic of Comme slow fashion for deep thinkers Dreamy$$Rei Kawakubo has cast a spell over her audience The fashion community strives to keep believing that fashion can touch deeper meanings in this time of often bewildering industrial change and she's the one people turn to for some kind of emotional stimulus that goes beyond the blunt service of commerce Once more this season she again blocked the expectation that she would offer anything recognizable as clothes Instead she mounted a monumental sculptural meditation on Blue Witches a coda further explained by her husband Adrian Joffe as Powerful women who are misunderstood but do good in the world Was she talking about herself Comme des Garons as a retail operation has grown against all odds as an independent multibrand chain which buys young designers whom Kawakubo personally approves and sells their work in branches in Tokyo New York and London They definitely regard her as a woman with magical transformative powers who they hold in awe In those stores meanwhile Kawakubos own conceptual collections reappear in simpler wearable forms right down to ranges of T-shirts which indicate her original runway styles in cool ways Whether or not that qualifies Kawakubo as a literal Witch it can safely be predicted that the ideas she put forth on her Spring runaway will make their way in far more accessible forms to her shops all over the word That surely gives her the right to go as experimental and extreme as she did this season$$All around Paris the Comptoir des Cotonniers ads featuring Charlotte Gainsbourg and her daughter Alice catch the eye without imposing upon it Fresh into her second season creative director Anne Valrie Hash said the Fall suiting and new Slash sneaker are outperforming expectations As for her Spring collection her enthusiasm radiated through the brands showroom First she presented an all-white grouping a tuxedo-style blazer and trousers and a slouchier pullover with rolled-cuff pants Next she made the case for military-inspired jackets paired with ingenue base layers Hash seemed especially excited to reveal Comptoirs partnership with J Brand (both are part of Fast Retailings roster) and the resulting denim range Unsurprisingly the sneakers will return this time in denim gray jersey and floral-printed leather She showed how small details such as knits with deep side slits make a big difference in how the clothes can be worn And once summer arrives a new cotton-viscose blend dubbed Ma Double Peau (My Second Skin) will solve the summer-weight sweater woes Dresseslong patchwork white lace with a drawstring waist a flimsy embroidered and printed slipmarked the seasons apogee Yet when Hash singled out the well-proportioned overcoats (neither too boxy nor too slim) and the hickory stripe slacks noting that they could have been worn 10 years ago and could likely be worn 10 years from now she revealed how smoothly shes integrated the Comptoir spirit with her own Overall she seemed well aware that maintaining momentum is as simple as keeping things simple$$Seventies 80s 90s Any which way you cut it fashion is in the midst of a vintage moment Whats a born and bred minimalist to do Costume National designer Ennio Capasa to his credit isnt changing his tune Hes been around too long for that a fact he likes to emphasize on his mood board labeling images from his past with their season and year For Spring 2016 he doubled down on the tailoring hes long been associated with and streamlined his color palette Backstage he said he focused on fabric development to create sensuality Glitter pinstripes polka-dot fil coupe and suede laser-cut to look like lace made appearances A minidress as silvery as tinsel was gathered at one shoulder with a silk ribbon Still you couldnt help but feel Capasa preferred the simplicity of basic black or white which he used more than anything else here perhaps because it put nothing extraneous in the way of his tailoring This season his suiting had a somewhat softer more feminine sensibility than it has in the past Ruffles cascaded down the front of a vest and metal rings connected the front and back panels on jackets leaving a suggestive slice of shoulder exposed Minor developments A single red pantsuit worn with a sheer red turtleneck underneath made a lasting impression but otherwise this collection couldve used more spark$$Does the world need another heritage brand Probably not Do women outside of France have any special feeling for Courrges Unlikely But any doubts about Sbastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillants efforts to revive Andr Courrgess space-age label were quickly dispelled by their show this morning The LVMH Prize finalists who put their fledgling line Coperni Femme on hold to focus on this endeavor made a clever debut Their trick was to get down to basics As the pair said when they came out onstage to introduce the collectiona charming performance that was a novelty in and of itselfthe show had no total looks Instead there were iconic Courrges items tweaked for 2016 shoppers15 in all and each one available in a range of 15 different materials That kind of variety will be a boon to retailers which tend to want items unique to their stores And it was refreshing to see young designers focused so clearly on commerce especially in a season when others have been creatively flummoxed by new responsibilities at the historic brands theyve inherited  The show felt a bit like Courrges 101 what with the steady progression from the houses familiar cropped jacket in a crinkly patent to miniskirts A-line shifts and cropped pants in such materials as suede techno knits and patchworked leather The foundation for every piece was a white ribbed knit bodysuit that Meyer and Vaillant could spin out in a dozen directions next season if they choose to  Courrgess owners Jacques Bungert and Frdric Torloting planned this launch just about perfectly The late 60s and early 70s have been trending on the runways since Nicolas Ghesquire landed at Louis Vuitton Julien Dossena has done a bang-up job of breathing new life into Paco Rabanne whose work shares similarities with that of Courrges Timing counts The faster this foursome can get these pieces in shops and online the better$$Spring found Jade Lai in conversation with Le Corbusier The Creatures of Comfort designer was looking at the storied mid-century architect and his prolific elemental legacy After a stay at his Brutalist Marseille masterwork the Radiant City it seems the pair struck up a natural repartee Lais collection opened with a grouping of graphic prints in jolie laide color combos The first look was a shirtdress in blocky black red white and pale yellow It was bold to be sure Elsewhere that mood manifested itself even more vividly as with a sheeny cherry-red tank dress layered under knit shorts in an equally punchy shade of the same color Among other standouts were the closing pair of looks liquid-looking cupro pieces rawly appliqud with designs inspired by Le Corbusiers drawings The architect would no doubt have approved of Lais take on off-shouldernot some festival-ready style gauzy and hanging from the collarbone but a graphic straight-across chicly seductive version Styled beneath a knit slip dress it felt in step with the runways recent mood What was particularly notable about these pieces though was their sophisticated brand of commercial appealscarcely anything looked daunting to style Denim was particularly strong here Lai had expanded her explorations with the stuff since Resort and she may well have the ultimate high-rise flare on her hands Whats more elemental than dreamy blue jeans$$When does something thats come and gone come back into fashion Creatures of the Winds Christopher Peters asked backstage before the labels Spring 2016 show and during a moment when fashion-conscious girls everywhere reach into their closets to pull out everything from 20s tea dresses to orange-tab-bearing Levi's 501s and sleek contemporary suiting its certainly a worthy question For Peters and design partner Shane Gabier it became a way to create a pastiche of all of their favorite things in their latest collection from cropped motorcycle jackets with seams co-opted from 40s corsetry to bias-cut skirts 30s slip dresses and glam rockinspired denim As it processed by on the runway it had the not-entirely-unappealing feeling of a yard sale attended by punky young femmes with bouffant hairdos and fishnet tights This being Creatures of the Wind the winsome 70s were never far behind whether spotted in the densely floral-embroidered miniskirts and crocheted vests or the chunky-heeled hand-painted snakeskin slingbacks that alternated mostly with slip-on sneakers designed in tandem with APL And while theres certainly something to be said for culling all the best bits from the current trendsfrom a silky wallpaper-patterned cotton jacquard and a wispy silk-cut floral dvor slip of a frock to trouser legs and tunic hems replete with ring-pull zips for ones own adjustmentsthe most winning looks felt truest to Creatures of the Winds own sense of charm cheeky trim knits paired with sloping skirts and an army jacket emblazoned with a hammered silver floral motif the type of treasure that can become both utterly trend-resistant and just the ticket for weathering spring The designers choice to begin and end the show with a suitthe first in block-print linen the last in black cotton sateen worn with a flowing ivory and metallic-striped pleated dress and trousers that ended mid-calf in a thick wide cuffproved a happy accident Its where we are said Peters pointing at the run of show and thats where were going$$As nineties fashion references go hip-hop gets short shrift Grunge keeps coming back so do nods to original Helmut Lang But the hip-hop aesthetic which had such a resounding impact on mainstream style is reinterpreted comparatively rarely on luxury fashion runways Thats changingsome of the kids who grew up on hip-hop are fully formed designers nowbut still it was striking to see Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochss homage to the look at their show today Ochs and Cushnie came at hip-hop via the work of painter Kehinde Wiley famed for his Baroque-style portraits of black men clad in the everyday garb they wear on the street Wiley made for an interesting bridge inasmuch as the reference to his work allowed the designers to play with tropes for which they clearly have a great deal of affectionnote the baggy pants and bandanas pleasewhile simultaneously giving their collection a sense of hauteur This was relative to previous Cushnie et Ochs outings a very ladylike collection That tone was evident especially in the color palette which erred toward Easter-egg pastels but it was also reflected in the number of rather demure silhouettes There was skin to be surebest seen from the back in the apron-style openings of certain tops and dressesbut the duos signature pencil dresses were not so much body-con this season as classically form-fit There were a lot of feminine grace notes here as well like the little flutter of a ruffle edging one yellow frock or a scarf collar on another dress in seafoam green Other elements such as black leather and bright gold buttons or zips introduced a harder edge Cushnie and Ochs were onto something interesting using a reference typically perceived as tough to soften up their signature look and in so doing elevating it a great deal They should make a habit of thinking that way$$Custo Dalmau called his Spring collection Slow which appeared to be a bit of a misnomer at first because the head-on collision of prints colors and textures felt more like a frenzy Actually the collections name is an homage to slow cooking of all things which the show notes defined as a culinary movement that rejects the standardization of taste Dalmau wanted to go against the current he said defying the pull of fast fashion and deliberately designing pieces that would require painstaking and time-consuming work One open-work vest was assembled like a puzzle from different pieces of fabric that had been cut into geometrical shapes Backstage one could admire the impressive handiwork but on the runway it was hard to notice because between the contrasting car-wash-pleat skirts color-saturated dresses layered over slinky striped flares and embroidered patchwork contraptions there was simply too much going on The collection would have benefited if Dalmau had subtracted a few ingredients that way we could have savored the unique taste of each piece$$Perennially sunny Cynthia Rowley was feeling especially so today in the airy white-walled expanse of her new West Village headquarters for intense planning on multiple fronts had come to fruition The surf-inspired video showcasing her Spring collection was in the can as they say her Rowley Fitness lineloaded with wetsuitshad arrived her new furniture line was on the way and a home fragrance was in the works But most painstaking of all had been the HQ itself Bought a year ago and exhaustively renovated (It looked like the water-logged insides of the Titanic quipped the designer) it was also finished or very nearly so down to the Instagram-friendly gold door painted on the outside The space will double as a kind of community center she said with yoga classes and everything But if Rowley seemed exhausted (she didnt) she was only feigning it She is forever looking and moving forward Her Spring collection exemplified this willful cheer with its splashes of sequins in floral patterns bursts of metallic tinsel trim tufts of fluttery shredded chiffon comfy knits bold twill appliqus and studs the size of saucers A colorful 60s-style worldliness prevailed Shapes were roomy and breezy think caftans jumpsuits A-lines and mini kimonos all sashed liberally Accessories too were shiny and happy in particular cat-eye sunglasses and a large beaded necklace that looked straight out of a Frida Kahlo self-portrait Now there was a woman with cheerful resilience  Rowley is an avid surfer as are her daughters hence the wave-riding theme of the video which will debut tonight in an immersive installation that thanks to drone technology all but plops the viewer beachside It was touch-and-go though As a storm moved in the day of the shoot Rowley sprang into action and got the cast and crew out to Montauk earlier than planneda triumph of logistical will to be sure What can I say she chirped Im a pathological optimist$$Sure Daks was born in London shows in London and maintains a retail home on Jermyn Streetthe greatest old-school menswear thoroughfare in the world Those British roots though have become a mere backstory for a house that thrives in Asia and most especially in Japan where its owners are based Today the brands creative director Filippo Scuffi delivered an assured portfolio of conservatively au courant womenswear that avoided the painful Anglophile bombast that has marked some of Dakss most recent shows The catwalk was plastered in marble-patterned paper and lined with chrome-effect cladding as if to resemble the Art Deco foyer of some grand 1920s hotel Along it unfolded a collection that played with some tropes of that time There were flapperish chiffon dresses marble-print pants and a pleasant recurring diamond relief Scuffi had sourced from a bolt of wallpaper printed in 1925 Yet this lineup roamed confidently beyond one particular theme There were some deftly handled plays on trad gents fabrics rebooted as feminine masculine shirting detailing emphasized on silk blouses and brogues that were transformed into double-strap high heels Rust the key color in Dakss historic check translated nicely into a slouchy suede patch-pocket skirt a shirtdress and scrunchily tactile bombers A pleat-heavy riff on chiffon dresses and blouses printed with iterations of that wallpaper pattern in teal and purple were well-executed takes on the Royal Tenenbaums-influenced Pucci/Gucci/Prada reappropriation of soft 70s kookiness Most meh-heavy was a climactic evening section whose various grand gestures of volume or length seemed out of sync at least to this eye Backstage Scuffi pointed out that one recurring printa washed-out botanical X-rayhad been a special request from Asia And when a designer is thinking so hard about one particular market it seems churlish to complain that his collection isnt perfect for another$$The plaintive refrain that rings through Milan every Fashion Week goes thus Where are all the young designers Who's got a different voice So although he's a transfer from Paris the arrival of Damir Doma is something for locals to relish He's a jolt of beard-scratchy thoughtfulness in a town whose fashion business is gripped by the sleek a bit of spiritual underground to offset all the commercial overground Doma held his first Italian womenswear show in two adjacent garages behind Via Torino which gave it that most blessed of elements outdoor space On a rough-and-ready catwalk of chipped concrete the designer showed some comely new variations on his severe and monastic metier Crisp papery cottonin all-white checks or darkened navy strafed by stripeswas melded into restrainedly asymmetrical shapes given depth by fold and knot A loose micro-check overcoat was satisfyingly gathered by a looped closure The burnt-out opaque jumpsuits were a touch iffyhad the unreconstructed testosterone that courses through Milan dosed DDbut the same fabric incorporated into patched degrad black trousers worked well A fil coupe of distressed abstract shapes was deeply Doma palely interesting austere moody It suits this designer to be close to the production of his clothes and it suits this city to host him$$Shallow castellations of ruffle encircled floating corsets apparently boned by silver zippers that were the recurring chorus of this collection Armor-like of aspect and surely ideal for the encouragement of positive posture these topped the skinny pants and fluting skirts corralled by David Koma into what he said was a loose meditation on contemporary dance Folded strips of tulle wound tight around the body on fitted monochrome dresses or hung slacker on a dress of barely pink neoprene-lined napa with unzippable sections in its organza-lined skirt Swarovski gridding had the tough ornateness of a samurai breastplate on closing looks that reasserted the ruffle-topped corsetry A sheer skirt angled away from a matte black leather sports bra to make an incongruously funereal Empire-line dress Every detail whether languid ruffles a mushrooming gather or a remixed neckline appeared as intensely wrought and thought out as the most grueling dance routine And it is this relish that lends Komas work such a powerful signature$$Is novelty always necessary There are only subtle changes to be found between David Michaels collections but thanks to the near-perfection of his louche tailoring manythis reporter includedare all too happy to see him staying his chosen course of badass basics The fine finishing softly rakish fabrics and general minutiae may be lost in the context of a lookbook but are impressed upon you straight away on seeing Michaels wares in person (find them for example at Totokaelos massive new Soho digs where they hang alongside the likes of Haider Ackermann) According to Michael's origin story his grasp of patternmaking and how clothes hang came to him in a dream and indeed that innateness seems to translate into the ease of every garment from staples like slouchy pull-on pants and menswear-inspired toppers to more out-and-out sensual pieces like Springs hyper-languid jumpsuit Michael infused his signature shapes with a little witchy glamour too thanks to a glossy black jacket that gave major shades of The Hunger$$One imagines that Josep Fonts mind might be a lovely place to spend some time Theres an anachronistic quality to the designers brand of demi-couture as he has established it in his three years at the Spanish heritage house Delpozo His romanticism and unreservedly fairy-tale brand of femininity hearken back to another time and the designer has a love of dressing women thats palpable  For Spring Fonts women were those of Federico Garca Lorcas Gypsy Ballads and Emilie Flge muse to Gustav Klimt and in fact a fashion designer herself who envisioned proto-bohemian styles far ahead of her time Many a creative director has name-checked Flge in the past but rather than appearing merely as a vessel for Klimts famous aesthetic here Font found a grounding force in Flges love of folklore and the similarly earthy qualities to be found in Lorcas famous book Font whose work so often has an almost synthetically confectionary tenor to it incorporated those craftier elements into his vernacular in rich and compelling ways Take a stunning hand-crocheted long raffia vest or that same material brought to life in a massive icy blue belted wrap Pieces like that served as textural welcome foils to Fonts most purely extravagant looks If otherworldly volumes are a signature of his tenure with Delpozo thus far then the larger-than-life shirtdress in a metallic palm jacquard with tiers of generous ruffles or a sheer pannier-like miniskirt surely pushed even Fonts own boundaries (the fabric of the former came to life beautifully and more quietly as a fringed wrap over white trousers) A grouping of polka-dotted pieces early on and a long rounded skirt in graphic orange and blue scrollwork could surely have been cut from the collection since their sharpness felt so at odds with the ethereal ideas Font proposed elsewhere A blue and pink moire frock served as an especially vivid testament to Delpozo fantasia at its best and contrasted nicely with the houses first move into purses a chicly boxy doctors bag$$For decades Dennis Basso has enjoyed a loyal customer base of great dames and society women But recently the designer has been refocusing his collections to entice a new clientele The whole look this year it appeals to a younger woman said Basso backstage Its very youthful and vibrant and its all about the cities south of the borderCaracas Acapulco Rio But it was a subtle modern Latin flavor Basso was after The designer was thinking of Selena Gomez (whose song Good For You played on the runway) and Sofa Vergara This is for the hip international woman said Basso That translated to sultry playful ensembles that sizzled in marigold black and a vivid abstract tropical print which looked particularly fresh on a peplum top and shorts combination not unlike something Gomez would wear on the red carpet In fact the print was strong enough that it didnt need the embellishments that Basso adorned it with elsewhere Lace-up necklines and crop tops that wrapped at the waist injected a dose of sex appeal to the designers signature glam dresses and evening separates as did his take on Spanish lace on body-hugging dresses I think no matter who she is every woman wants to have that sex appeal said the designer  Basso was mindful not to stray too far from his core customer Evening coats boleros and black-tie-appropriate gowns were all present A gorgeous caramel croc bolero styled with a saucy lace camisole and high-waisted briefs was a standout It was the kind of investment piece one could imagine Bassos longtime customer purchasingonly to have it promptly co-opted by her daughter$$If Derek Lam 10 Crosby VP of design Liz Giardina is endorsing fringe pom-poms and eyelet this spring maybe minimalism really is on its way out The contemporary label tends to be a bit more eclectic than the tony Derek Lam main line but the surplus of texture and trim in this new collection still felt like a bit of a departure Giardina started with Andalusiabull-fighting clothes Moorish architecture saturated colorand made it palatable for her city-dwelling customer The Spanish reference was literal in the case of an embellished matador jacket less so in the clingy ribbed knits with ruffled edges but all of it was right-now wearable and in keeping with fashions artsy far-flung mood Clever twists on classic pieces are the center of the 10 Crosby brand See the ankle-length LBD with tiered ruffles the crisp shirtdress with hidden suspenders or the patchworked floral slip with dense eyelet trim A simple knit  dress in vibrant stripes and a ropey texture also managed to be special yet wearable Thats the sort of piece that will draw women to the rackeven those who wouldnt normally reach for a leather lace-up jumpsuit only to slip it on and instantly realize its endless styling potential Of course shoppers who are still hesitant to embrace the picador look should take note of the new accessories raffia wedges a patchwork hobo or a fringed bucket bag would add just a hint of flair to any outfit$$What Happened Miss Simone the Netflix doc about Nina Simones rich but up-and-down life was a starting point for Derek Lam this season Simone is a classic Lam muse American independent but not afraid to show her feminine side and fond of both caftans and the occasional pantsuit  Spring found Lam working the artier more bohemian side of his typical sportswear story One or two of his treasured trenches made their way down the runway lapel-free buttonless and as unfussy as usual And he did a new take on sailor pants another signature Elsewhere though Lam tried out just-this-side-of-eccentric ideas like cutouts at the hips of a skirt strung together with sneaker laces or circular swags of fringe placed here and there on a sleeveless sheath Those looked familiar from other recent runways and they distracted from simpler stronger pieces like intarsia knit dresses slips inset with lace that drifted softly away from the body and a chic sweater whose big quirk was its bell sleeves The show ended on a high note with siren-y gowns that Lam suspended from the neck halter-style to expose a sexy bit of shoulder$$Devon Halfnight LeFlufy cited nostalgia as the driving force behind his Spring collection a nod to the youth subcultures and style tribes of his adopted home Belgium (hes Canadian by birth) Showing mostly mens his strength with a sprinkling of womens the designer spoke of rave symbolism coded dance the frisson of youth meta-awareness found footage and the regrettable unoriginality of the Internet era A documentary-style approach as in a rave-scene print on intentionally oversized overcoats felt bold and novel Also suiting the theme of idealism were LeFlufys fabrics of choice poplin faux leather and a viscose rayon he developed LeFlufy earned his BA and MA at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts a premier fashion college associated with the Antwerp Six Excellent provenance to be sure and hes clearly benefitting from its legacy of wild imaginations chiefly that of Walter Van Beirendonck a pioneer of menswear with whom he trained LeFlufys ideas are at once conceptual and energetic not an easy feat to pull off nor was getting on the short list for this years LVMH Prize Itll be interesting to see where with some tightening he takes the label$$In the wake of the 40th anniversary of her iconic wrap dress Diane von Furstenberg seems keen to keep riffing on her origin story She called her show Fortvna after the Roman goddess of luck and the subject of the first painting Von Furstenberg ever bought She redefines beauty and paints her own destiny the program notes read Fortvnas curriculum vitae sounds a bit like DVFs own The models for their part wore their hair in waves with a fresh bloom tucked behind one ear the way Von Furstenberg did in her younger days Self-promotion is smart businessthe entrepreneurial Von Furstenberg would be the first to tell you that And more often than not this walk down memory lane paid off Perhaps nobody wouldve missed the metallic lam suede if it had stayed in the archives and the butterfly embroidery that she lifted from the painting erred a touch on the sweet side by the time the third dress emerged in that motif But the charm of the patchworked floral-print dresses in short and long varieties compensated Lily Aldridges plunge-front halter number would stop New York City traffic A shirtwaist style and a long dress crisscrossed below the bust by a skinny belt were more demure but still fetching  There were a few brief nods to the 2010s in the form of olive green leather separates and a single pair of work pants but Von Furstenbergs heart was in her heritage this season Nearly four decades after Studio 54 the one-shoulder dress hasnt aged a day It practically radiated here in multiple layers of saffron and pink chiffon$$According to Andreas Melbostad the starting point for this seasons Diesel Black Gold collection was the image of a girl wearing her boyfriends button-down shirt as a dress Thats one of those images that recur frequently in fashion and whether the trope comes off shopworn or as a durable idea that can continually be renewed depends entirely on the inventiveness of its reinterpretation Melbostads tack was to take scarf-like squares of cotton shirting-like fabric and pattern them intoslipdressesand skirts with handkerchief hems The look was repeated in white-and-black geometric broderie anglaise and with studs and in leather and most appealingly in blue-striped cotton broadcloth that quoted directly from the original inspiration The pieces each had a kicky charm but Melbostad hammered the look home a few too many times which dulled the collections impact Of course Melbostad hadnt forsworn the Diesel Black Gold staplesbiker jackets and denim The brands biker signature was worked into buckle details and sharp-looking dungarees and leather overall dresses There were also relatively straight-up biker jackets emblazoned with hardware The jeans meanwhile came off best here in versions dark mannish and low-slung but the Diesel Black Gold girl will also like the pairs done in lace or lace-textured white denim Theyll look pretty sexy matched with her boyfriends button-down shirt$$When hes applying himself to the craft of his clothes Dion Lee is the most rigorous of designers Hes a brilliant technician But the curious thing about Lee as his show this morning underscored is that he often seems incapable of applying the same degree of rigor to his collections overall as he does to their component parts This is hardly a problem unique to Lee but its particularly striking in his case because both his sense of discipline and the scope of his talents are plain to see Lees latest collection was a strong one but it needed an edit The best individual looks in the showthe black-and-navy scuba dresses with perforated flounceswere the ones that interfered most with the story Lee was trying to tell this season And that was an interesting story The collections nubby suedes bias-cut linen gauze and hues of rust and sand all expressed Lees ambition to introduce an earthy tone to his clothes while the loose-limbed silhouettes throughout the collection and an emphasis on patterns with relaxed wraps or folds asserted a soft sensuality Touch was key here and was manifested on both conceptual and literal levels in Lees looped and fringed looks in black-and-white triple-ply jersey The weave he explained after the show was inspired by the structure of skin And the textile that resultedLees main technical innovation herehad a compelling muscularity You could intuit the hand that had worked those jersey loops All of which is to say when Lee was on today he was very on And he was more on than off Alongside the scuba dresses however there were a clutch of filler looks that should have stayed with the sales team in the showroomto wit the suede biker jacket and slashed miniskirt or the anodyne dress of cobweb lace Dion Lee is Mr Focus when it comes to the micro If he ever figures out how to direct that focus to the macro there will be no stopping him$$When Donna Karan debuted DKNY in 1989 she specifically declined to categorize the looks she produced as fashion Fashion has seasons It changes over time What DKNY was about Karan told reporters was clothes In other words durable staple pieces that suited the on-the-go lifestyle of the brands target clientele DKNY launched casual and took on a more formal tone as time went on the brands most iconic look perhaps is the early-90s-era pinstriped power suit That was the primary point of reference for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne the popular pair behind the brand Public School as they took the DKNY reins To focus on the pinstriped suit was a canny choice on their part Where they faltered though was on emphasizing fashion over clothes Times have changed since DKNY first came on the scene Chow and Osborne are perfectly aware of that and their riff on the power suit included exactly zero actual power suits Rather what they offered to the present-day DKNY woman was a handful of broad-shouldered wide-lapel pinstripe blazers and a dazzling variety of de- and reconstructed power suit looksto wit a sarong-style pinstriped skirt a pinstriped tunic dress with an attached cotton skirt with shirttail hems and broken pinstripe silk prints There were sheer windowpane-striped fabrics worn layered and vertically ribbed knits that extended the pinstripe theme as well as shirtdresses and papery white tailored pieces that toyed with other key elements of the power suit look Some of these adaptations came off better than othersmenswear experts that they are Chow and Osborne cut a very mean blazer and their layered tank dresses with shirttail hems and sheer T-shirt dresses with knit underpinnings successfully updated the relaxed attitude of the original DKNY for a modern audience The curious thing about this collection was that it simultaneously betrayed Chow and Osbornes deep respect for the aesthetic codes of the house theyve taken over and their reluctance to embrace what those codes once meant One of the ways times have changed since 1989 is that DKNY is a giant brand now and so to some degree commercial imperatives may be at work Staple pieces dont have much novelty factor on the sales floor But it would have been nice to feel that Chow and Osborne had thought a little harder about the lifestyle today of the DKNY woman and what kinds of essentials she might need To their credit Chow and Osborne approached this show with a healthy dose of humility As they explained backstage the missing piece motif witnessed in the broken pinstripe prints and the pleated half-skirts among other looks was meant to express their sense that theyre still learning about the DKNY woman Shes coming together they said But shes not all there yet$$Stefano Gabbana was sitting amid a sea of accessoriesvelvet slippers with turned-up toes earrings in the shape of lemons and oranges crocheted raffia bags wooden clogs with rose-painted enameled soles and gigantic sunglasses decorated with flowers and crystalsin the Dolce & Gabbana studio before their show Meanwhile Domenico Dolce was coaxing laughs from a model as he fitted her into a black lace bra and skirt and proceeded to demonstrate how he wanted her to first sashay the runway then stop to take a selfie You see exclaimed Gabbana We dont believe in fashion for trends any more We want to show emotion Just enjoy  Their inspiration boards were pasted with printouts of vintage posters advertising the attractions of Capri Venice Rome and Florence movie stills of Italian stars and pictures of all kinds of handmade homemade souvenir embroideries This summer the designers have moved on from exploring Sicilian history to seeing Italys glories through the eyes of the foreign tourists who began to flood into the country after World War II There visitors found little shops selling embroidered circle skirts and sundresses printed scarves sandals straw hatsthings that Italian women had been making at home to cheer themselves up in times of austerity This is where the first boutiques came from explained Gabbana We think it was the beginning of Italian fashion And it was because foreigners saw it and liked it Sometimes we Italians dont appreciate all the things we have here Stepping back a bit to view the D&G show through the prism of the season it seems that Italian style and culturethe flamboyant sensual colorful sides of itare being appreciated again Alessandro Michele is on the same sort of track at Gucci and at Valentino theres a deep exploration of the glories of Rome In fact Dolce & Gabbana were actually on the scene first and have succeeded in grabbing girls and women from all around their world with their seasonal travelogues If that means ditching the anxieties of fashion and just going for clothes that suit and make you happy So be it say Dolce & Gabbana$$Dondup creative director Manuela Mariotti was looking at a more feminine romantic direction for Spring she tapped with gusto into the current feeling for all things bohemian in a collection that referenced poetry rock n roll Shakespeare and Glastonbury Part indie music goddess part Ophelia fragile beauty the Dondup girl was ready for her close-up swathed in fluid billowy dresses with frills galore and a touch of folklore Prints were digitally reworked from Indian motifs or suzani tapestries giving a vibrant feel to elongated lines in bright hues that popped up from a black background The mandatory 70s-style references were also on display high-waisted tunics bell sleeves wispy fabrics troubadour-ruffled blouses flared cropped pants It all made for a cohesive lineup with a graceful yet concise feel where denim was not at the core but more of an accent presented sparingly and in relaxed shapes It often happens when you design a collection that you get carried away working on an idea that then brings you in a completely different direction said Mariotti of a process that started with a futuristic vision and then morphed into a celebration of a free feminine spirit Empowering women and enabling them to express creativity is a theme very dear to the designer who despite the Ladies of the Canyon hippie vibe abundantly displayed in the collection still loves a good tough rock n roll gig and a well-fitted sexy pair of denim to dance the night away$$There comes a point in the season when the brain starts joining up the dots between collections or in the case before us here the trail of tarnished sequins Something in the detail of what Dries Van Noten did todayarranging gold copper carnation and pale blue paillettes in stylized winglike patternsalso resonated across the Atlantic with similar flashes of decoration by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte A sense of the faded glamour of old-time movie stars (or perhaps just the fusty remains of Old Hollywood costume departments) is seeping into the edges of several shows At Dries Van Noten it looked great glimmering on the bodices of long printed 1930s midi dresses or decorating white shirts and placed on the shoulders of sweaters A latter-day Katharine Hepburn would do them justice Whether there are or arent some parallels between 30s and 40s escapism from World War II and our need to gaze in the opposite direction from todays conflicts Van Noten didnt overtly draw attention to them in his notes Still there was the background of the show to contend with not the gilded grandeur of the Htel de Ville this time but a derelict industrial warehouse with rusting girders accessed through a crumbling concrete loading bay choked with weeds Not that there was anything melancholy or down-at-the-heels about the collection itself Essentially it was a steady continuation of Van Notens love of rich traditional fabrics like jacquards brocade and shot silk used this season in intriguing clashes of purple yellow ocher kingfisher blue and watermelon The addition of tattoo-like patterns on gloves socks and turtlenecks seemed to refer the eye to the Asian and tribal threads that run through the histories of such materials There will be plenty more of the Van Notens customers favorite pantsuits coats blouses and skirts next seasonif not very much to wear on a sunny summer weekend or holiday$$Dean and Dan Catens new collection for women picked up where their Spring 16 show for men left off at the beach Waves splashed on the backdrop of the otherwise stark set and out strutted Mariacarla Boscono in a cutout maillot and hip-slung boy pants a tangle of colorful climbing ropes harnessing her torso This hasnt been a big week for bathing suits but the Catens gave us several different varieties from sporty one-pieces to slinky little bikinis strung up with crystals Sexy has more or less gone out of fashion in Milan but not chez Dsquared2 Aside from those boyish trousers and a couple of pairs of high-waisted tie-dyed jeans the look here was seriously leggy Pleated chiffon maxi skirts split open in the front and otherwise it was all minis Leather bandage dresses Knit tube dresses worn two at a time And best of all clingy scuba dresses with antecedents in Nicolas Ghesquireera Balenciaga that combined tropical prints with bold swipes of color and three-dimensional embroideries This collection showcased the Catenss strengths sexy athletic silhouettes special denim their insatiable eye for color It also exposed a weakness their too-strappy overly high platform shoes Were not asking for Birkenstocks even though real-life surfers do have a predilection for those old-school cork-soled sandals just something slightly more down-to-earth in which the models could really move$$Duro Olowu has a talent for picking muses His latest is the artist Amrita Sher-Gil the Frida Kahlo of India as Olowu described her who managed to establish both an impressive body of work and an equally impressive reputation as a freethinking sexual experimenter before she died suddenly at the age of 28 Olowus silhouettes this season were a touch suggestive of those of India in the last days of the Rajthose late 30s bias cuts broad lapels and built-up shoulders fit neatly into his idiombut mainly it was Sher-Gils spirit that he drew on for his new collection He conjured her via a mix of boldness and ultra-femininity The boldness came through in the prints the best of which was a dot-and-stripe on silk that Olowu confessed hed doodled while on the telephone (Never throw anything away is the moral of that story) There was also a painterly yet graphic wild orchid print which Olowu executed with his typically canny sense of color Olowus clothes always have a feminine flaireven his tailored pieces boast a certain voluptuousness He doubled down on that here showing lots of looks that featured flounces and ruffles A long ruffle-hemmed camisole worn with a matching likewise ruffled long skirt for a tiered effect made for one of the collections standout looks Another was a black dress open in the back and ruffled down each side Olowu doesnt usually mess around with neutrals but this frocks all-black color (or lack thereof) only showcased the grace of its cut There was a similarly appealing sense of frankness to the cotton pieces in cobalt and khaki As noted Sher-Gil died young Perhaps that accounts for the fact this collection seemed an unusually youthful one for Olowu It was hard to put a finger on where that tone came from exactlythese clothes werent a far cry from those Olowu has created in the past Maybe it was the extra skin on display about the back and shoulders maybe it was the way these pieces even down to the gowns exuded an air of thrown-on informality Whatever it was the youthful kick added to the appeal of Olowus familiar aesthetic without diminishing its friendliness to women of all ages styles and shapes$$Perhaps the easiest way to explain Each x Other is to think of it as Fashion x Statement Designers Jenny Mannerheim and Ilan Delouis once again turned out attitude-enhancing clothes conducive to art parties (no coincidence the show took place at Emmanuel Perrotins spare gallery in the Marais) Then they recruited ongoing collaborator poet-artist Robert Montgomery as well as editor Jefferson Hack to anchor the collection in idiosyncratic aphorisms You sleep on the feathers of birds and their flights fill your dreams from the former Hack the system (in which the letters HA appear dripped over an FU) from the latter Using words to build a wardrobe explained Mannerheim reinforces the semiotics of style  and self-expression Basically we can choose to communicate overtly by sporting an oxford shirt patched and embroidered with Montgomerys words or a T-shirt printed and embroidered with Hacks Or else we leave ourselves open to interpretation when we wear a mannish peony pink suit or a tailored jacket featuring unraveled pleated cuffs Like the contrast in tone established by their guest contributors (who incidentally have known each other for 15 years) the collection boiled down to counterintuitive pairings striped silk pajama pants with a black leather bra a languid ivory robe coat disciplined with black straps down the sleeves and extra-long feather-printed shirttails trailing from snug cavalry jackets There was also a Belgian influence  la Dries Ann and Veroniqueunspoken yet unmistakablewhich they used to dial up the poetic rawness Mannerheim mentioned how artists be it the Beats or Impressionists have proven stronger as collectives than as individuals And indeed one cant help but wonder whether this duo is too reliant on its Other But then as one of Hacks other musings seemed to suggest the essence of cultural is the cult$$In recent seasons Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta have risen to industry-wide prominence with their label often described as arty avant garde or post-gender The RISD grads have a real point of view (a rarer thing than you might think) which is unlike anything else on the New York schedule For Spring they came up with an evocative collection working as usual without set concepts (no Paris in the 70s or the work of Jackson Pollock for these two) When the bicoastal designers convened in their New York studio to prepare for todays show they were struck by a feeling that fairly pulsed through their samples lust Whether the stuff of the id or just ideas that are bubbling around in Pops collective unconsciousness (some would say between the runway and the red carpet were more preoccupied with baring it all than ever before) these clothes were hot-blooded and also eerily poignant For some the nudity (transparent pieces galore) on Eckhaus Lattas catwalk will be the foremost topic of conversation but as Eckhaus and Latta approached the idea it had to be among fashions least gaze-oriented expressions of the body These might be clothes about titillation but they didnt seem intended to titillate Chalk some of that up to the casting choices Alongside proper models were extended EL family of various ages and walks of life (Dev Hynes Juliana Huxtable Alexandra Marzella and Grace Dunham among others) Even the bits that didnt bare it all revealed plenty Consider pants slashed along the knees or the back of calves or a slip dress hem that fell above the knee to reveal a flash of thigh Even when Rihanna shows up in a sheer body stocking theres the sense that she has revealed less than these clothes did The collection was largely stripped bare with gorgeous anemone-like body pieces crafted from glass bugle beads functioning as one of a couple of nods to self-ornamentation in the traditional sense Beyond the conceptual there were plenty of just plain great clothes here and wearable to boot The most transparent styles would work well for layering meanwhile a cropped suede mock turtleneck and the sensuous peach velvet suit were things that many a front row guest was keen to wear straight off the runway The cerebral and the visceral in one collection Now thats versatility$$Edeline Lee drew upon a pleasing confluence of inspirations this season The London-based designer was having a Richard Diebenkorn moment appreciating the painters Ocean Park series when it struck her that the artists palette and his geometries dovetailed with those of the designers of the Memphis Group The graphic Memphis look is trending in fashion these days and Lee wound up leaning toward that aesthetic as she whipped up pieces for her new collection the influence was particularly clear in items such as the shift and maxi-length shirtdress featuring a multicolored geometric placement of prints These looks had plenty of pop but Lee was onto something fresher in the garments that conjured Diebenkorns more poetic tone and softer line Specifically the designer had winners in her twisted tops and dresses in a painterly jacquard and the plainspoken white or pastel-colored halter tops and culottes which suggested Diebenkorns brand of California cool without hammering the reference home Elsewhere a pencil dress that collaged several pastel-patterned fabrics married the softness of Diebenkorns canvases with the architectural sensibility of the Memphis school Lee sometimes has a habit of overworking her designs but she mostly kept a lid on that here She flubbed a few pieces by introducing unnecessary sculptural flourishes or insisting on an out-of-whack proportion but where she kept her looks simple and let their fine materials gorgeous palette and cheerful geometries do the talking the clothes didnt just speak they began to sing$$Tethering high-fashion values to sustainable ones isnt an easy task yet its something that creative director Danielle Sherman has managed to do since she took the helm of Edun in 2013 The brands commitment to producing ethically sound clothing in Africa is now a decade deep thanks to founders Ali Hewson and Bono and for Sherman the continent has been a rich source of inspiration too  This season it was the ceremonial dance costumes of the Kuba Kingdom in Central Africa that piqued the designers interest and those familiar with the tribes distinctive graphic textiles might have picked up on the influence in the hand-loomed polka-dot pattern on a fringed jumpsuit Beyond that though the references were anything but literal Intricate African craftwork was subtly woven throughout insteadbe it on the tassel of a pointy slipper that was made in Morocco or the macram trimming of a modish cropped suit fabricated in Madagascar  There was a gentle 30s sway to the collection tooa nod to Dada performance artist Sophie Taeuber-Arpand you could see signs of it in the contrast stitching of pleated pinafore dresses  and the neckline of a charming sailor-inspired look One standout top in workmans orange was a particularly compelling take on the off-the-shoulder trend thats been sweeping both the runway and the streets this season Given that the brands sleek new line of handbags was manufactured in South Africa its clear that Sherman is charting new territory with Edun in more ways than one$$People only vaguely familiar with the label Electric Feathers may be tempted viewing its collections to see very little change over the years Members of the growing Electric Feathers club can see the evolution however Designer Leana Zuniga is committed to certain looksblouson trousers architectural sundresses rope-necked jumpsuitsbut shes updated her silhouettes of late and elevated her fabrications The most obvious change this season was Zunigas deployment of print which she generally eschews Her fine stripe and tonal ikat introduced a distinct albeit understated sense of rhythm to the pieces where they were found while a more graphic print of joined hands added some jolt to the new collection without detracting from its overall minimalist hippie vibe Electric Feathers aficionados will also note that Zuniga jettisoned her signature harem pant silhouette in favor an exaggerated jodhpur girls with a religious affinity for harem hems can continue to find them in the one-shoulder knee-length romper another new shape Zunigas best innovation on that front however was her broad-legged trouser and jumpsuit with an overlayer of fabric that made the items read more like a voluminous skirt or dress Pieces like that explain the Electric Feathers cult These are clothes impossible to categorize as casual or dressy You can wear them either way and theyre both at once The tailored garments that punctuated the collection erred more toward the casual side items in peach-toned silk lam veered dressy But Zunigas allergy to fussiness always prevails and to such a degree that its possible to overlook the rigor of her method But make no mistake As this season reaffirmed Leana Zuniga brings a steel-spined discipline to bear on her project which is to reinvent the look and feel of the basic$$Elie Saab is an eveningwear specialist with an established formula for often monochromatic unapologetically romantic gowns studded with embellishment thats as intricate as his ambition is straightforward Saab wants to make his customers happy Many of these customersliterally hundreds of themwere at his show today as usual accounting for one enormous big-haired and super-spritzed bank of seating at his Tuileries venue What they saw though seemed subtly different from the designers tried-and-tested narrative Its not different demurred the man himself backstage afterward Its the same But the mix is different  In short this meant the insertion of more separates and versatile day-to-night pieces before the introduction of Saabs nocturnal standards For proof inspect the first looks on two of his big-name castings Both Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner wore mid-length dresses Hadids was tiered in blue lace Jenners black and with an empire line Over these they wore bomber jacketsHadids in rich candy-striped gazar Jenners in a more softly toned floral embroidery Although he is not entirely new to the bomber to put both of these bound-to-be-Instad models in the jacket sent a message this was Saab-meets-street To underline that there was a distinctly un-Saab black-flashed white tracksuit worn with flat sandals and Jenners floral bomberwhich acted as a radical foil to the more conventional pussy-bowed white jacket and wide pants in broderie anglaise that had preceded it Leather mini suits with small floral cutouts a soft silk armless striped jacket a cute black lace bomber and a crystal-spattered floral-patched halter-neck white minidress  (almost tennis-like in its silhouette) were a few other examples of the new elements in Saabs mix It made for a pleasantly broadened watching experience But he was careful to emphasize however that he wasnt about to throw the baby out with the bathwater He makes a mean macram lace gownsimultaneously wistful and willful of aspectand there were plenty here The closer to the finale the denser the eveningwear became alive with fin sparkle ripple and train By the time his stars reappearedJenner in a deep-V crystal and lace jumpsuit with two trails of sheer black silk that ran from shoulder to ankle and whipped in the air as she walked and Hadid in a complicatedly luxe-goth black open-front dress of lace and silk panelsnormal service had resumed Ive just met many of my clients now and everybody is happy reported Saab And if theyre happy hes happy$$The playful artisanal vibes that trended heavily on the Fall runways are still a big message for Spring 16 particularly for contemporary brands like Elie Tahari The designer was thinking about the intersection of natural and future this season so he moved away from the architectural silhouettes hes known for and embraced an easier more bohemian sensibility Billowing chiffon dresses deconstructed tweed jackets and loose-fitting trousers in soft shades of taupe cream and black felt destined for a trip to the sun-baked desert New for Tahari was the mix of textures like a jeweled tank with a raw linen skirt or a suede safari jacket over a ramie dress Pat Cleveland took the stage in a twill coat spliced with swaths of lace appliqu paired with ankle-length pants and gladiator sandals it was arguably the best outfit Cleveland always looks sensational but she embodied Taharis ideal woman in that all-white ensemble It was sharp sophisticated and feminine but with a new sense of warmth$$Kym Ellerys inspiration this season was the 1969 work Wrapped Coast by Christo and Jeanne-Claude which found the famed land artistes covering one and a half miles of rocky Sydney coastline in tarp The reference was legible on a literal level in the clothes that Ellery showed this morning but it almost worked better as a metaphor for her development as a designer in the past year Ellery has always exuded a vast ambition but she seems now to have made peace with the idea that the only way to execute her ambitions is to discipline them strap them down The designers evolved sense of rigor was nowhere better demonstrated here than in her approach to volume She still likes her clothes to take up lots of space but she found lots of ways in this collection to control her volumes or concentrate them into small significant gestures An example of the latter were Ellerys artfully suspended bell-shaped sleeves one particularly good instance of the former was the navy silk sundress that shed gathered here and there to create rows of soft pleats Ellerys volumes felt targeted and specific in other words With volume playing a supporting role much of the drama of this collection came from its fabrications Ellery is a textile obsessive and she deployed some outstanding ones this seasonvelvets printed in a sea-pod pattern a feathery cream-colored knit fused to create weight cloudy jacquard crepes silks and shirting cottons with an ultra-luxe hand You didnt have to get close to the clothes to appreciate the excellence of the materials it was self-evident from the way everything draped Ellerys standout material though was the crinkly metallic fabric she used in her shows terrific closing looks Ellery showed off her design maturity in those looks by not gilding the lilythe fabric was gilded enough all it required was a simple pencil-snug shape$$Great designers greatness is stamped on our memory by the signature codes they leave behind them Hence when other designers succeed the houses founder they face a challenge a delicate wrestle between the codes they have signed up to inherit and the urge to express their own point of view Their own codes in fact Today Fausto Puglisi cleverly sucked the tension out of that dialectic by focusing on Emanuel Ungaros joyfully frothy output of the late 60s and early 70s It was a neat little maneuver by sidestepping Ungaro-in-his-80s-pomp for Ungaro juvenilia Puglisi had something new to play with As the mood board demonstrated Ungaro in the 60s was a man of his timeand a designer whose years working at Balenciaga and most powerfully at Courrges could be seen in his work Puglisi chose to focus on a set of sweetly provocative floral macram looks all froth and of-that-era liberation touched with a softened Space Age futurism Impressively Puglisi re-established a connection with the Swiss factory that made Ungaros 60s pieces to create a wonderfully psychedelic lace macram of ochre flowers and paisley petals used in his last capeletteamed with matching thigh-highsand a long loose skirt The netted-check that ran throughout the collection even down to the weave of the pressed-foam ruffles that edged many of these looks appeared to be lifted from a pair of pants one of the mood board images showed Ungaro fitting on Twiggy A harder more Puglisi-ish preoccupationFaustianexpressed itself in the ringlet bonding on black vinyl and hot pink skirts and as suspension on floral-scattered bustiers A little bit bondage maybe but also    romantic Puglisi ventured backstage we had a laugh at that This is not a collection for wallflowers or delicate petalsbut for a woman in search of punchy in-your-face prettiness it will have allure$$Emilia Wickstead a designer known for dressing some of the most high-profile women in London society rolled out a bubblegum pink carpet for her models today That saccharine color was perhaps a nod to the 50s optimism that inspired the collection which was awash with soft hues recalling the era such as pistachio mustard and apricot It was the floral prints though which could have been swiped from a 50s dining room that made the biggest impression The cropped high-waisted pants and blouse that were sprigged with contrasting flower arrangements for instance were a modern way to wear the traditional ladylike motif Of course dresses are still Wicksteads mainstay and there were plenty to choose from The designer isnt one to shy away from volume one billowing geometric print look fell somewhere between a cape and a dress and another came with an impressive Watteau train Her experiments with proportion were at their most successful when confined to the sleeve of a frock somehow the gathered bishop sleeves felt more medieval than mid-century modern a vaguely Game of Thrones-ian feeling that has been coming through this season (Incidentally Michele Clapton the shows costume designer is up for an Emmy Award this weekend) That subtle yet dramatic approach to evening will no doubt find favor with Wicksteads circle of well-dressed and well-connected fans$$Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication it has been said Emilio de la Morena took that principle to heart this season And thank goodness De la Morenas dressmaking talents shine brightest when he pares his looks down to their essences yet he frequently evinces an aversion to doing that as though afraid his designs wont seem distinctive unless he overcomplicates them Not so here This was a collection with a straightforward mandatepretty dressesand its flourishes were relatively few Which made for some knockout frocks to wear to a cocktail do  The designer presented a fabric-focused lineup De la Morena has great taste when it comes to textiles and the materials he used served to elevate his most matter-of-fact looks The cream-color jacquard for instance introduced an earthy note to a soign pencil dress courtesy of the pebbled texture Tonal striped black gazar was not only sexy given its semi-transparency but it also allowed de la Morena to play with his signature geometric effects without detracting from the collections understated mood Elsewhere plain pink or yellow silk had a perfect limpid drapeone of those qualities in clothes that looks no-brainer but is actually devilishly hard to achieve The most striking pieces meanwhile were the pastel frocks and dressy separates embroidered with patches in metallic brocade The patches were in the shape of mountain flowers de la Morena said the pattern they made was redolent of leopard print which wasnt a bad thing There was also a very cool green-toned organza brocade with metallic fabric filaments left exposed The effect was a touch uncanny in a good way and here in particular de la Morenas strategy of hewing to classic A-line silhouettes allowed the specialness of his material to speak for itself This collection wasnt simple in the sense that it was minimal or basic It was simple in that it wasnt cluttered by a bunch of superfluous ideas There were just a couple of superfluities but then simplicity is a discipline Its a muscle This season de la Morena began again to work it out$$Emilio Pucci opened his first store in Capri in 1949 serving up kaleidoscopic printed dresses that by the 60s had become signifiers of a jet-set lifestyle recognizable well beyond Italian vacation destinations Massimo Giorgetti the young founder of MSGM one of Milan's recent success stories took the wheel at the iconic house earlier this year after Peter Dundass departure For his debut today Giorgetti started at the seaside which was the right instinct As the birthplace of Pucci it was a natural place for a new beginning  Giorgetti uncovered some compelling pieces from the archives a glance at his backstage mood board suggested he has an eye for the more obscure elements in the Pucci oeuvre Unfortunately this show was a bit of a muddle too literal in its references (there were sea turtles and lobsters tangled up in a fishnet dress) too dependent on styling and surprisingly low on prints Though it seems a shame to ignore them especially for a designer who built his business on irreverent mashups of color texture and pattern prints aren't the only route to success at Pucci The industry has seen enough revivals to know that it takes more than reverence for a houses heritage to make things click for an incoming designer But spelling out the founder's first name in script across the back of a slip dress along the borders of a shift and on the straps of flat sandals isn't the way to go either Hiring Giorgetti for the job indicated that the Pucci powers-that-be were after a radical change targeting the street style and Instagram-obsessed younger crowd that's been his sweet spot at MSGM That in and of itself isnt a negative and there are clearly larger opportunities at lower price points But Giorgetti has some work to do to right this ship$$Has a gray Armani pantsuit ever before been worn with a cropped T-shirt with a smiley emoji on it Doubtful but theres always a first time for everything and that was the way Giorgio Armani chose to open his Spring Emporio show maybe to emote a little casualness He got rid of his runway too and instead had his models walk on an illuminated path as if at street level (that is as street level as you can get when youre showing inside the vast Tadao Ando theater youve installed inside your own lofty building) In a funny way this is a favorable fashion moment for Armani againthings have generally turned relaxed and casual and he is once more a flat-shoe man in a flat-shoe time (exactly what Armani endured during the long reign of mega-platforms may only be imagined) So now he can get back to his natural state putting models in low pointy ankle boots and a variety of casual-formal sporty-pretty shorts jackets and tops for spring Gone are the days when Armani shows were essays in a million shades of greige (There was a time for greige lets remember It was the color of armor an entire generation of pioneering American power women wore to go into executive battle from the late 70s through the early 90s) This time he added a powdery bois de rosepink by any other namein a variety of techniques that hinted at flowers be that brocaded floral tailoring or a soft hybrid of blouse and jacket laser-cut into overlapping petals$$Erdems first look said it all A girl with a slightly trance-like expression on her pale face was treading her way along a red earth pathway prettily dressed in a delicate Victoriana yoked dress of pale gray chiffon strewn with embroidered pink and white flowers which seemed to be coming apart at the shoulders So far so enchantingbut what the designer said about his inspiration will make you go back and take a long second look It was about prairie madness he explained backstage In 1862 Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead Act which gave single women and widows the right to their own plots of land in the West as long as they stayed there for five years So there were all these women coming from their homes in Europe bringing their clothes and the remnants of their lives in Norway and Germany and places like thatand they started to suffer from agoraphobia and all kinds of psychological illnesses A quick Wikipedia check also shows that suicide was not uncommon among these lonely women Could that black velvet ribbon at her neck knotted and displaced to the side start to look a little different in that light Erdems productions have taken on an almost cinematic quality recently often hinting at the backstories of imaginary girls and women who have fallen on hard times or traveled far from their secure homes Last season he placed his show in a down-at-the-heels 50s apartment set belonging to an heiress whose hopes in life were unraveling before that it was a tropical greenhouse for a tale about a Victorian woman botanist Part of this he always says comes from spending his boyhood obsessively watching Merchant Ivory films Hes a romantic who can only design once he knows the character hes dressing The prairie girls with their extraordinary wardrobes of ankle-length flounced dresses made of beautifully wrought lace crochet and embroidery fabrics are his sequel They arrived by railroadpushed along on an actual train track in a former freight yard in the hinterland of Kings Cross station with a few sticks of furniture to their names and then proceeded to make their long melancholy walk to a crackly soundtrack of Emily Dickinsons poetry Well put it another way Erdem may be brilliant at research and atmospherics but in the real world he also knows the minds of the women he actually dresses Next summer they are basically going to be in prettiness heaven$$Since her very first collection in 2005 Erin Fetherston immediately established her universe as one of whimsy and hyper-femininity Jeans have hardly had a place in the designers fairy tale But this season she surprised by showing a handful of laid-back denim pieces inspired by fashions perennial muse Jane Birkin Fetherston should step out of her comfort zone more often The overalls shorts and culottes in soft dark denim provided a welcome antidote to the designers tendency toward the overly sweet Also new for the brand a capsule collection of minaudires that recalled needlepoint hoops and were stitched with cute phrases faces or the word love Branching out into accessories is almost always a smart decision for a fledgling labeleven more so when they are as Instagrammable as these Fetherston hit the nail on the head Needlepoint was a recurring theme in the collection paying homage to the designers other muse this season Anne of Avonlea the early-20th-century Prince Edward Islanddwelling heroine of the Anne of Green Gables series Arcadian reverie is how Fetherston described it There was certainly a pastoral beauty to the floral-print dresses and skirts some cut with a train or layered with delicate sheer fabric that billowed behind the models as they walked Slips in sky blue baby pink and navy provided a base for some of these sheer looks and also stood on their own topped at times with a matching knife-pleated capelet White lace maxi dresses with high necks hinted at the Edwardian lace and collars worn by Anne in her dayand reclaimed decades later by Birkin Like all of Fetherstons collections Spring was romanticyet it was a grown-up romance$$Its a passion play of opposites said an upbeat Ermanno Scervino backstage before rushing out to greet Italys First Lady Agnese Landini a friend and loyal client The collection he presented today celebrated his signature hyper-feminine Italian-diva style though he tempered it with a contrasting dose of masculine and sporty elements Fortunately for Scervinos fans this did not tarnish the glam factor on the contrary it polished the edges giving the lineup a contemporary feel Craftsmanship took center stage with an elaborate display of materials textures and finishes Lace was utilized in myriad waysbonded with a double layer of delicate guipure embroidered with macram and jacquard feuillage and fused with cashmere pashmina to sumptuous effect The silhouettes were either elongated and slim or sensual and shapely evening fabrics were worked into tailored day coats and pantsuits Light organza gave shape to a classic tuxedo duster worn with cropped pants and flat embroidered babouches In another clever conception a sporty olive green jumpsuit was paired with a luxe mink jacket dyed a bright shade of bubblegum pink Masculine shirts in crisp striped poplin were a chic counterpoint to tight duchesse satin pencil midi skirts while shades of lipstick red served as an unexpected and striking contrast to a delicate periwinkle hue The result was a lineup of edge and modernity spicing up Scervinos trademark sensual touch$$Though Escada wont officially turn 40 until 2018 the Munich-based brand has already started celebrating For his Spring 2016 offering fashion director Daniel Wingate sought to emphasize the history of the label without getting stuck in the past The piece that perhaps best typified this effort was a silky tailored blazer inspired by Escadas scarves from the late 60s and 70s which was paired with smart black trousers Its the kind of thing that serves a woman equally well at the office or at a cocktail party Versatility and comfort were key this season Looks were styled with flats to emphasize a certain effortlessness to the clothes that will appeal to Escadas busy career woman Slouchy trousers roomy culottes and oversize tunics popped up in neutrals as well as primary colors like red and yellow (or limoncello as the brand calls it) The eveningwear was also carefully considered A romantic delicate blush pink cardigan was a thoughtful additionfor the demure or the always-coldto the matching strapless dress it was styled with Escada is best when it sticks to simplicity The floral pantsuit and chain-link belt felt overcomplicated and the jumpsuit-gown combo though daring seemed a little out of place Still simple neednt mean boring One of the strongest looks consisted of perforated white leather culottes styled with a white shirt that wrapped at the waist$$This time last year Esteban Cortazar presented a collection that hed already sold to retailers during the Resort seasonorders were placed even before the press weighed in While rethinking the industry cycle might not be half as sexy as Roos Abelss absshe being the very young model who opened tonights showit does help explain how Cortazar seems to have settled into the fashion firmament so fast  And now that his brand is viable he can start having fun which meant channeling an otherworldly creature as his latest muse Hence the python bra top asymmetric metallic leather gilet and platform sandals encrusted with Swarovski crystals Compared with Cortazars past two go-rounds this collection felt less mannered more spontaneous as he put it He credited the ideas to night-long parties in Ibiza this summer and how the clubbing impulse dates back more than half his life to when he was a precocious teen in Miami Beyond flaunting youthful vibes the pieces boasted savoir faire Laser-cut skins were backed in metallic jersey Lurex knit was developed to resemble a surface of jewels and then lined in cashmere so that it would feel soft not scratchy and metal rings were affixed onto coats like contraband watches creating a clanging chorus with each step It was about not being afraid to just play said Cortazar The past two seasons I was building her universe this season I just wanted her to be brave A clingy jersey dress slashed with shimmer has already proven a retail favorite as has an oversize shirt that billows from behind Tellingly they represent two of Cortazars easier looks yet theyre sure to get heads turning from dusk to dawn$$Veronica Etro today delivered a sumptuous medley of house staplesthe kaleidoscopic prints the rich concentration of color and the bohemian sensibilityin a collection that also melded European folk costume Victorian Pre-Raphaelite nostalgia haberdashery Arts and Crafts and a shot of Ballets Russes It was pretty busy Yet it was to Etros great credit that with so very much going on here at first glance nothing on the runway ever seemed especially OTTFor while there was plenty of ruche and flounce and ruffle in her silhouettes particularly on the soft undulations of her sleeves these were never jarringly proportioned piecesTo get lost you had to stareintothe clothes On one look alone quilted printed cotton was shot against gridded twine run through with embroidered ribbons that were overlaid with ivory silk and hemmed with silver lace above a scalloped hem Reversible bombers combined strata of ribbon and dvor silk A lace-fringed dress was a patchwork of floral-wrought paisleypatterns drawn from the Etro archiveoverlaid with a hypnotic constellation of dots that recalled the antipodean psychedelia of Kean Etros most recent menswear show Backstage Etro said that she had left some of the finishes rough in the wine-toned closing section to resist the sweetness and whimsy so much ornament might otherwise muster There was friction and roughness and pain in this romance just so emotional perfection was not the objective In a season that is betting heavy on 2010s appropriations of kooked-up 70s approximations (thinkPicnic at Hanging Rock) of Edwardian lady laciness Etros analogue abandon was a cynicism-free take Victoriana eminently incorporable into the cool-girl wardrobe$$Eudon Choi spirited showgoers away to Gaelic lands with a palette-cleansing collection that sprung from the fantastical paintings of John Anster Fitzgerald The Victorian artist known for fairy-filled works that may have been opium-fueled brought an ethereal touch to Chois otherwise minimalist spring outing The sprightly references came through from the delicate sprays of pale blue lace that showed up on sleeves and skirts right down to the pleasingly off-kilter mismatched Victoriana boots There was another very on-point mood at work here though the waif-like lines of the grunge era This was a fairy fantasy with an undeniably 90s edge The decades strong stripped-back feel appeared in the industrial slate fabrics that opened the show on layered dresses and capes and later in the raw-edged drape shirts and asymmetric slash skirts hewn in tactile Irish linen As the dreamy chords of Portisheads It Could Be Sweet played out the palette shifted from cerise to soft peach to midnight blue with Mackintosh-y dresses that Choi intends to be worn to smart gallery shows There was a breezy oversize silhouette throughout as well as a minor obsession with drawstrings which allowed Choi free play with shape and volume Gone were the harsh and architectural lines of Fall In their place came a lesson in restrained prettiness For the finale these proportions became even more exaggerated in pale hued jacquard day gowns that provided full cover Theres so much body consciousness in the world Choi said after the show referring to the protective feel of the more voluminous looks I wanted to create an elegant and easy beauty that allows an escape from that$$Brooklyn may be trending in Paris but the vibe at Faith Connexions headquarters is distinctly LA sur la Seine Step through the door at its htel particulier (part of which is a small hotel) and a certain very famous someones matte black Porsche Panamera is parked there In the courtyard members of fashions fabulous class are gossiping while eating lunch while texting on their iPhones At the reception a fashion shoot in which a blogger poses lying shoeless underneath an antique chair is taking place  Upstairs in the showroom where the racks are lined with torn jeans graffitied leather jackets and lacy white dresses that look like they stepped off the set of Guns N' Roses November Rain video the sales are brisk Faith Connexion has never done a runway show and refuses to name its designer (it's more or less an open secret that former Balmain creative director Christophe Decarnin is in charge) The brand has caught on in spite of all that because nobody nails the grungy I-woke-up-like-this lifestyle better For spring the attitude is essentially the same as previous seasons only more California-fied Tropical prints registered as new as did sweatshirts spray-painted with palm trees Hammer pants which take their name from Oakland Californias native son MC Hammer even turned up But the big winners here will be the oversize army jackets tagged by Faith Connexion's resident graffiti artists whose appeal appears to be universal A rep reports they sent 25 of said jackets to a Seoul Korea store and they sold out in a week In a savvy development the brand is now also customizing the jackets to clients' specifications$$Caitlin Price is London fashions latest phenom Much like Simone Rocha Pricewho showed her second collection today as part of the Fashion East lineup of emerging designersmade her mark on the scene by inventing a new kind of girl one with her own distinctive look and attitude Only time will tell whether the Caitlin Price woman will prove to be as multidimensional as the one Rocha dreamed up This season Price has sharpened her outlines showing new versions of the luxuriously fabricated beautifully detailed tracksuits that she offered in her debut and expanding her dialogue between high and low aesthetics by creating half-gown skirts and cutaway nightclubbing dresses that had the tough tone and casual mien of streetwear The mix of silk and poly taffetas in the looks underscored the high-low theme Price is up to something genuinely interesting but she gave few hints here as to how she plans to augment her design vocabulary In the meantime though she has gotten everyones attention This Is The Uniform a new entry into Fashion East is the brainchild of recent Goldsmiths grad Jenna Young Its her bad luck that she was showing with Price inasmuch as the two cover similar territory Youngs debut likewise toyed with ways to draw appreciative attention to and elevate the look of working-class youth Her take was less audacious and clear-cut than Prices but on the other hand more expansive Her mix of sharp crop tops net sweaters A-line minidresses and trousers slungvery  inventivelybelow the hip hinted at a strong instinct for creating the elements of a womans wardrobe as opposed to a few strong headline pieces Fellow Fashion East newcomer Richard Malone also concerns himself with the working class His modus operandi is more conceptual however than that of Young or Price For starters theres his approach to fabrication Malones workwear materials were sourced from overstock and other types of waste and though he elevated these fabrics by sculpting them into rather soign shapes he maintained a sense of matter-of-factness by eschewing corsetry or other restrictive elements His clothes are made to function And the emphasis on wearability went to the collections overarching theme which was a celebration of female labor at home and in the workplace A high-waisted flared jumpsuit with a ruffled halter neck didnt at first seem like a garment that could withstand the trenches but in fact it was cut precisely to stand up to a hard days work Ditto a striped dress expanding in wavelike volume as it extended toward the knee Malones look was intriguing but it was his sensitivity to the user experience of his clothes that makes him one to keep an eye on$$Faustine Steinmetz turned the idea of denim inside out with her first collection and the intricate hand-loomed pieces she created from recycled thrift-store jeans were anything but basic In her third season the French designer is looking to grow her business beyond the confines of her atelier in East London She partnered with a denim mill in Spain for Spring 2016 and the resulting collaboration takes her artisanal sensibilities to exciting and scalable places Micro-pleated denim is among the new fabric developments in her repertoire (clearly the Issey Miyake ripple effect we saw come through in New York is making waves across the pond too) and it gave a sculptural dimension to such staples as the jean jacket To add to her experiments with true blues Steinmetz took to deconstructing the tracksuit with what shes calling dvor jersey one classic gray marl sweatshirt in particular unraveled into a stream of floor-grazing fringing Her couture-like weaving expertise showed up in the hand of a striped polo shirt which like the pieces of her first collection took a week to make In an age when supply and demand often takes precedence in the fashion food chain its encouraging to see a young designer picking up the thread of time-honored production values in a modern wardrobe with such spellbinding innovation$$Fausto Puglisi admitted to a case of nerves before his show today Since he arrived on the Milan Fashion Week scene three years ago embroideries have been his stock in trade bold brassy and full-throttle Possessing as strong a signature as Puglisi does is something of a mixed blessing We all love a designer with a recognizable voice but sooner or later that voice starts to sound familiar Puglisis new collection for Spring represented his biggest step yet away from the embellishments with which he made his name hence the nerves  Citing Madame Grs and Halston as reference points Puglisi embraced silk jersey with a hand so supple so liquid that it has to be touched to be appreciated But even without copping a feel you could tell he was up to something new and different with a draped ivory gown boasting an asymmetrical cape straight out of ancient Greek statuary We expect to see that dress making the rounds this awards season It was that soign Other goddess dresses in that same material be they short or suspended from a bandeau bathing suit top or in a bright combination of red white and blue struck a more expected note They werent bad they just didnt have that element of surprise  In the end this collection wasnt a complete departure anyway There were scads of Puglisis beloved embroideries but he gave them a novel spin mixing honest-to-goodness seashells with sprays of multicolor rhinestones part Malibu part Dallas with some fine Italian-made intarsia knits thrown into the mix Not for the timid but then thats never been the Puglisi way We have a hunch that the encrusted cowboy boots if he winds up retailing them could become a mini cult hit$$One can always count on a pithy comment from those Milan stalwarts Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi Chaotic elegance deadpanned Rimondi describing the design duos latest collection for Fay which is one part of the Tods empire It was also an apt phrase to describe many of the showgoers outfits as heavy rainstorms lashed the city on its first day of runway shows causing inevitable traffic havoc and wardrobe mayhem But chaotic is not a word one would ordinarily use to describe these designers aesthetic which tends to be defined by pristine prettified clothes This season their deft precision was worked on the military field jacket a small point of reference and its myriad possibilities Where a chaotic notion entered it was in setting the rigor of combat garb against traditional paisley curlicues embroidery ruching and prints that had a shade of Bloomsbury about them The elongated sleeve proportions added a more youthful element to the uniform improvisation Floral-print dresses and pretty separates like a cute blush suede frock came with scalloped sleeves and cutout paisley swirls To counter some of that girlishness and with a knowing nudge to the designers desire to add a younger following to their loyal clientele the Fay field jacket will likely have mass appeal It hit their runway in numerous iterations cropped and in a more urban denim version in white There were navy incarnations too and a series of embroidered styles had a semblance of Tyrolean influence A small idea for a larger world$$What if the Lisbon sistersthe five doomed girls at the center of The Virgin Suicideshad never killed themselves Imagining an alternate happier history for the Lisbons inspired the Spring collection of Felder Felder the London-based brand designed by German identical twin sisters Daniela and Annette Felder In their version the Lisbons party their way from Michigan to Miami and age disgracefullythink The Golden Girls gone wild The oily blue in the metallic fabric of their first outfits a sharply cut broad-lapel suit and follow-up dresses shone sickly slick Banana palm and flamingo prints appliqus and jacquards were scrambled and diffused as if squinted at through aging eyes  There was a potent dose of the staple Felder fare that their lushly blow-dried regulars had come to whoop for floor-length underwear revealers skater skirts with cutaways at the hip crop tops aplenty and a chiffon baby doll Yet there was a pitch at maturity toothis show was about the Lisbons growing up after allin a suite of Art Baselappropriate cream looks in silk jersey twisted only by the odd Lurex-piped panel or cry-for-help undone shirt A tomato pink and white color-block aside was carefully conventional And despite the artificial whoa there clash of pink apricot and gold in their tropical jacquard the fabric was used to hew restfully nipped dresses pencils and outerwear  Afterward Annette Felder observed that this kind of harmonious dichotomy is something the designers do naturally Its always hard and its always soft and that comes from our being twins So whos the hard sister and whos the gentler one It changes both chimed into avoid being hard on each other$$Sick although in quite agoodway Thats the only possible response to the coral leather mini-bloomer playsuit that proceeded fourth in the Fendi collection today Coral Leather Bloomer Playsuit Such a thing could no doubt cause ridicule offense or even pity if viewed on the everyday street Yet when seen with our fashion glasses on we can instantly perceive that this garment has precisely the right number of attractive-repulsive features to qualify it as ideally avant-garde It has the puff-shoulder sleeves the 80s-yet-not yoke the gathering into a high-neck nearly-but-not-Victorian collar While below it provides exactly the correct amount of photographer-attractor leg exposure to satisfy girls who congregate at and outside fashion shows  Fendi is a serious Roman fur and leather house of long standing but recently Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi have been having some fun with it all There are no references

of the fashion news that is running through Spring It was there in the silhouettesthe big-sleeved high-neck high-waisted and pleated midi thing thats currently going on In Fendis case they provide the backdrop for ultra-luxurious house materials and skills summer furs in a rattan-basketwork open-weave technique cropped jackets in whipstitched patchwork python and braiding and smocking effects Fendi x Karl Lagerfeld may be 50 years old as a collaboration but in some ways its still ridiculously friskily young Again in a good way$$The palazzo pajama was originally created by Irene Galitzine a cultivated Russian princess turned couturiere who lived in Rome in the 60s Her clientele ranged from thegrandesdames of the Roman aristocracy to Audrey Hepburn Jackie Kennedy was also a fan and sent her a lovely thank-you note in 1963 that read I was so touched at your thoughtfulness in sending me your marvelous pajamas for Christmas But it was her friend Diana Vreeland who with her usualpanache gave the chic ensemblea masculine-inspired blouse paired with wide pantsthename thats still used to these days that has become synonymous with a sensual androgynous and eccentric way of dressing The fashion world has longbeen fascinated bylounge-inspired attire recently almost every known designerhas tapped into what has become a global trend But for Francesca Ruffini a refined woman with a calm demeanor the passion for pajamas reaches back to her personal lifestyle and to her desire for both comfort and elegance Ive always lived in a pajama because it has a uniform quality that I find appealing itsthe first thing I wear when coming back home after a day outside she said during the presentation of her Spring collection held in her sprawling flat in the heart of Milan Her pajamas are veritable pantsuits that can be worn 24/7 carrying you from day to night or can be worn as separates I likethe monogrammed jackets of my custom-made pajamas with a demure midi skirt the pants look great with a tailored blazer said the designer while pointing out a lineup in sumptuous silks sourced in her native Como and printed exclusively in festive colors Each lookwas accessorized by a sleeping mask that couldmorph into a graceful headband To further demonstrate the already convincing versatility Ruffini expanded the range with fluid robes de chambre (read bathrobes) in elongated linesmade in liquid languid jacquards they were perfectto be worn as dusters or evening dresses The effect was of subtle yet alluring seduction She also added a bra to wear under the coats I hate the look of exposed lingerie she exclaimedin mockhorror But my husband encouraged me to add a sexy-yet-elegant touch to make the look more desirable The husband in question is Remo Ruffini CEO of Moncler who actually happens to know a thing or two about making a successful fashion business His suggestions on the subject cannot be easily overlooked$$For a line that has made its name setting the denim trends beginning with its first pairthe ubiquitous Le Skinny Jean of 2012Frame Denims Spring 2016 presentation began with surprisingly few Actually there werent many bottoms at all The new pant is no pant laughed cofounder Jens Grede at the Soho presentation or is it the Emperor's New Pants Whatever the takeaway it would have been easier if the models didnt look so good Nearly all were clad in 70s-influenced separates (often worn well quite separately) Tight knit tops and tees had sleeves that extended only to the elbow and tucked into fetching A-line skirts long loose jeans were gently cuffed into a more girlfriend-friendly boyfriend jean silhouette snug knit bikinis were sported under multi-pocketed denim jackets and slouchy tops were worn seemingly alone or over the briefest of shorts It appeared to be for all practical purposes a full view into the future wardrobe of every leggy young fashionable thing on the premises as well as those of the heavily Instagrammed runway regulars after whom they model their wardrobes  The intended feel was that of an American girl who falls in love while visiting the 70s French Riviera then began infusing the local wardrobe with American sportswear tropes said Grede name-checking the story of the recording of the Rolling Stones Exile on Main St (a rundown chateau exercises in redefining the term louche for a generation) though the Gallic striped tops and thick elastic headbands in some looks certainly nodded to another famous Riviera-ite namely the classic St-Tropez bombshell herself Brigitte Bardot (who its worth noting also had no problem with not wearing pants in public) Swimwear was a new venture here born out of the organic design process that Grede and cofounder Erik Torstensson have pursued since the labels founding New washes led to new cuts and styles of denim which in turn inspired a shirt trousers in suede and leather and now swim Next time well do something else said Grede Were going to go darker cooler It looks like the emperors have quite a few clothes in their future after all$$Born and bred in Naples (in Pompei no less) Francesco Scognamiglio is still deeply in love with this city of staggering beauty and louche-ness opposites that coexist in a web of inextricable contradictions This clearly feels quite natural for the designer who delves with abandon into Napless history and decadent heritage for inspiration All that was apparent in his Spring collection in which he referenced the esoteric Sansevero Chapel a 16th-century masterpiece that hosts the statue of the Veiled Christa marble wonder that looks so incredibly real as if it were made of actual flesh draped in the thinnest of fabric  Theater mirrors artifice said the designer backstage pointing out wispy ruffled dresses in white and shell pink light as a feather and almost liquid in their sensuality Transparent Chantilly lace and inconspicuous point desprit conjured up a romantic feel for fluctuating long dresses exuding reminiscences of boudoirs and 18th-century courtesansyet they were slashed layered and multitiered to modern effect Black silk mikado jackets with round shoulders felt more substantial they came inlaid with graphic intarsia inspired by peeling stucco ceilings that looked like cracks through which a delicate jade green lining could be glimpsed Dresses in white or black liquid satin were printed and embroidered with an oversize iris motif and adorned with an abundance of rosette appliqus they balanced the overall barely there effect and the nude transparencies of the lineup The craftsmanship was undoubtedly exquisite It makes sense that Scognamigliobacked by a new investor Malaysian entrepreneur Johann Youngwill debut his Haute Couture collection in Paris in 2016 where hell finally fulfill a childhood dream$$Barneys New York has installed Gabriela Hearsts debut collection on its third floor between Chlo and Cline Not bad for a fledgling label in its first season Hearst arrives on the scene with a pedigree she hails from a grand Uruguayan ranching family and shes married to a descendant of William Randolph Hearst but this is no vanity project The proof is in that Barneys exclusive and in her evolving collection When she launched the line in February it was tempting to classify Hearst as another Phoebe Philo disciple a practitioner of the luxe minimal style that has dominated at retail for the past few years But a season later a distinct point of view is emerging one that marries an urbane elegance with a rawer even rustic look that nods at her heritage That difference will work to Hearsts advantage especially as the fashion pendulum swings away from restraint toward a more exuberant sensibility There were any number of understated smartly cut coats and coatdresses here and theyll find plenty of customers when this collection lands on sales floors So too will the streamlined strapless evening column with a built-in choker necklace (it connects to the dress in back) Inevitably though the items that made a stronger statement were the ones for which Hearst took bigger risks A tank dress with floor-sweeping proportions was cut in Lurex-striped gauzebeach fabric she called it adding It makes me feel comfortable when somethings not so perfect Hearst should continue to follow that instinct A rugged washed-cotton field jacket was one of the collections most desirable pieces Elsewhere she took cues from her husbands cycling uniform for a ribbed-knit cashmere dress in bold athletic stripes Sexy as hell it will stand out among the sea of knits about to inundate the runways and its one more reason Hearst should keep going her own way$$Its the rare bird who admits hes not interested in dressing exhibitionists but Gabriele Colangelo is one such individual Theres no sparkling embroidery here quipped the meticulous Italian backstage Listening to the designer who hails from a family of furriers animatedly describe his seasonal fabric innovations is an uncommon experience For his Spring collection utilizing technology to an extent seldom seen he shifted his attention to experiments with velvet (laser-cutting it to resemble the age-old dvor technique) and kidassia (aka goats fur) transporting the materials into shape-shifting textiles and remarkable summer statement pieces The overall silhouette was long and lean narrowly pleated silk tunics were paired with contrastingly hued trousers in lavender copper turquoise and an eye-catching mustard Sleeveless tops velvet-accented slip dresses and a wonderful velvet jumpsuit possessed a similarly elongated feel Symmetry was occasionally broken by the unexpected tweaking of a jackets sleeves many of which had extended cuffs One of Colangelos most interesting new fabrications is a variation of Kentethe West African cloth produced in narrow overlapping strips and usually woven of cotton silk and sometimes gold thread Colangelos version is distinguished by sheared silk threads which from a distance resemble fur He used the fabric to create wispy coats trousers and jackets that were pretty and light as a feather Many of the outfits that followed were similarly tonal and textural at times employing pleats under transparent silk or creative use of kidassia For a handcrafted feel he applied the tufty tone-on-tone material to necklines and hems or worked it as stripes adding a 70s undercurrent and an enticing of-the-moment feel$$Youre so money Recall if you will that unforgettable line from Swingers delivered in the midst of a pep talk at a nightclub Money is the primary way we denote value in our society Youre so money means you have so much value You are so very good Gareth Pughs latest collection was so so money Literally in that there were actual pence coins sewn onto the clothesa gesture that in a different collection youd be tempted to read as a statement about luxury or something along those lines But Pughs money wasnt raising questions It was proposing a solution Go out Go balls out Dress to the nines as though everything this world has to offer belongs to you because it does You can buy whatever you want with the currency that is you Be extravagant with yourself and for gods sake have fun The high spirits of this collection meanwhile raised a question What on earth got into Gareth Pugh this season Heading backstage after this exuberant brilliantly styled show you half-expected to find Pugh bouncing off walls and singing the praises of a new cocktail of serotonin reuptake inhibitors or better yet a new love The truth was rather more prosaic Pugh was up to some point-making here We each contain multitudes was his message and reputedly dour Gareth Pugh is perfectly capable of putting his well-developed design muscles to work in the creation of a collection with a disco mood just as the Gothic Gareth Pugh babes hes cultivated see fit once in a while to slough off their cares and paint the town red  Red was Pughs signature color this season The color pulsed through numerous looks from the impeccably tailored silk faille suits with their flared attenuated silhouettes to the paillette-covered short-shorts made for shimmying The paillettes made perhaps their most stunning appearance in a trim black trench coatthe way the sequins dappled about the coats chest and shoulders suggested the movement of strobe lights dancing over pitch-colored clothes The nightclub atmospherics extended into Halston-esque draped dresses and looks in a black-and-white diamond patterned jacquard that conjured the undying incandescence of club deity Leigh Bowery The nightclub energy was present too in Pughs excellent Mongolian furtrimmed plastic jackets with their frisson of sexual possibility (and perversity) The overall effect was magnificently louche Pugh clearly knew hed be shocking the audience by sending out a collection premised on the pleasure principle Did he know hed be showing them perhaps his best collection ever He probably knew that too Pugh should engage his gaudy side more oftenhere he demonstrated that his rigor as a craftsman can turn pretty much any look into pure class His artistry is so money And Pugh has more where that came from He can afford to spend freely$$Displacement as a positive force Its a theme that in one way or another has often coursed through Gary Grahams clothes His keenly researched collections contain multitudes with enough references to make an art history majors head spin A brief shopping list of a few of his aesthetic touchstones for this season the word asunder Buddhist vestments Iranian carpets historical mourning garb seminal experimental filmmaker Jack Smith and Queen Elizabeth I Generally speaking Graham weaves together such disparate ideas with ease Despite his period fodder the results are unplaceable in time and geography Take silk dresses in an ornate print borrowed from the aforementioned Iranian rugs or a trapeze maxi inspired by a traditional Turkish wedding dress Paneled in black and shimmering gold it was easy to imagine on some cool young thing at one of the citys artier events His message got perhaps a bit muddled in a mixed-media top that married Victorian mutton-chop sleeves tapestry and ticking stripes More winning were dresses in perfectly polished shapes but with plenty of grungy appeal splattered with bleach till they reached an uncanny shade of goldenrod Transformation of another kind was afoot in a grouping of items that riffed on the idea of remnants Graham had lately been reading Chlo Griffins oral history of Cookie Mueller and he tapped into the books descriptions of a thrift store in Muellers native Baltimore The resulting pieces came edged in all manner of metallic sundries Particularly savvy was Grahams decision to build out his offering of pieces that boast a broad appeal but make more of a statement than your pure basics A pair of ethereal blouses a poet number with full sleeves and a sleeveless top with a slashed sheer high neckline both fit the bill as did his supple Peruvian knits in a graphic black-and-white pattern inspired by tile work Grahams lookbook styling may have an editorial loftiness to it but there was a surprising amount of real-world potential to the majority of these clothes$$How do you explain a thing like the red-white-and-bluestriped sequin hot pants at Giamba today Or for that matter the sequined lipstick bullets the sequined red-painted fingernails on embroidered hands the sequined stars daisies planets hearts and stars Well if youre Giambattista Valli you point to legendary 1990s New York club Jackie 60 to Donna Jordan to Tom Wesselmann and above all else to the #FreeTheNipple movement Its really all about Free the Nipple Valli exclaimed backstage after the show and to some degree it really was The very abbreviated frilly hippie frocks the little sister customer (that is in relation to his big girl Giambattista Valli line and one supposes adored child to his big mama couture collection) has come to expect from Giamba were here again only this time with heart- and star-shaped patches-as-pasties much in the manner of the emoji carefully placed by your favorite bare-it-all Instagram star Think an aristocratic Miley Cyrus Some models had their lanky pale hair raked through with pastel pink and lilac dye as if they were members of the Source Family who ran off to Burning Man and never came back Some wore zebra-striped ankle socks with sequined shoes or tutu-style skirts with sweatshirts There may not have been an immediately available narrative through-line but going out clubbingor freeing the nippleis after all chiefly concerned with celebrating a certain joie de vivre And really what are those stars and stripes (even when sequined as a bustier or brief) about if not freedom$$Giambattista Valli has been tending toward a more sixties silhouette in the past few seasons and his familiar full-skirted looks made way for a sharper Youthquakeinspired line today The Italian designer likes to surround himself with a circle of stylish women that spans generations and two of his favorites sat in the front row todayLee Radziwill and Bianca Brandolini DAdda There was an air of romance about the collection that is likely to appeal to both those women starting with the pretty Art Nouveauinspired florals that were present on everything from balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses to neat cropped trouser suits Beyond a penchant for floral prints intricate embellishments are a Valli sweet spot and shimmering 3-D petals found their way onto the thigh-grazing miniskirts and mixed-media A-line coats Naturally Valli designs with a glamorous social calendar in mind and finding new ways to invigorate a black-tie dress code is always on his agenda The silk scarves that topped the bohemian floor-sweeping dresses made for an unexpected alternative to the traditional statement collar With their eye-catching glittering soles the gladiators were a charming and modern re-envisioning of the evening sandal one thats sure to have legs on the red carpet come spring$$Lets start with the last look Because that laser-cut micro-pleated satin organza gown goes a long way toward explaining what was going on at the Giles show tonight Flame-haired Karen Elson emerged looking to all the world like the genetic clone of Queen Elizabeth I reanimated to preside over some postapocalyptic England (or at any rate a United Kingdom of which Elizabeths thorn-in-the-side Scotland is no longer a part) And that was precisely Giles Deacons point The show was held in the Elizabethan-era Banqueting Room in Whitehall a place to which the designer would often retire as a student to get away from hustle and bustle and take in the Rubens murals on the ceiling Hed booked the space for this season a year in advance and a deep dive into the history of the place led him back to Elizabeth and provided him the inspiration for his new clothes In other words this time out Deacon was in one of his historical moods Its a frame of mind that usually results in maximal looks and on that score this collection did not disappoint Working with print designer David Holah of Bodymap Deacon created a print based on a scan of a full-length portrait of Elizabeth I which found its way onto silhouettes as varied as a leotard-taut bodysuit and a diaphanous caftan There were also Baroque wallpaper florals and embroideries based on tapestries But the real drama here was mainly to be found in the collections skirts and sleeves Deacon didnt stint on the volume cutting full bell- and balloon-shaped sleeves and frothing his skirts and dresses with parachute hems or underlying layers of tulle The patterned tights made for a nice complement to all that volume and they conjured a masculine Renaissance-era look Then there were the showpieces Alongside the satin organza gowns worn by Elson and Erin OConnor Deacon displayed his couturier skills in dresses embellished by an overgrown English gardens worth of tulip-shaped florets and finished other more plainspoken dresses with tender little frills As is often the case at Giles the showboating craft threatened to become the collections whole point and this season that threat was particularly acute The construction of a gown in a brown-toned understated print could wow you but the same material done up into a matter-of-fact silk jumpsuit underwhelmed It would have been nice to see Deacon apply more of his attention and artistry to his straightforward looks The designer was at his best here when he pulled out all the stops and anytime he did it was impossible not to be swept up in his storytelling One sight of Elson in that gown and all quibbles were forgotten$$Giorgio Armani continued his 40th-anniversary festivities this afternoon with a press conference and lunch in honor of his new self-titled book of family photographs and personal remembrances The 81-year-old designer was in a celebratory frame of mind even making a joke about his nose I was born with it he said pointing to the baby picture hanging behind him onstage But if the press conference was a moment for reflection and his recently opened museum is the repository for four decades worth of designs today's runway show wasn't the walk down memory lane that might've been expected Instead Armani chose a color little associated with his work red and made it the focus of a collection that was also noteworthy for its lightness a quality that happens to be synonymous with him His notes specified shades of flame lacquer and geranium and more often than not he juxtaposed them with navy icy gray and white Coupled with graphic treatments like woven stripes polka dots and lozenge embroideries the palette gave the show a shipshape clarity quite in contrast to the hazy pastels of the Emporio Armani collection he presented last week Where the Emporio show was awash with pants here he was interested in walking shorts and abbreviated full skirts The trousers he did put on the runway were almost sheer and layered over opaque leggings for a look that was more discreet than seen elsewhere this season (A see-through skirt or two showed off more than he probably bargained for) Tailored one-button jackets in that same filmy material were the best pieces in the collection Though they were rather elaborately stitched with glinting glass beads and silk cord embroidery they too looked airy and weightless a real feat$$Tennis-loving cyborgs are taking over Or rather they did today on the runway at Giulietta where designer Sofia Sizzi imagined the sport and its aesthetics as well as robots through the lens of Courrges sending out an army of mod-looking automotons in punchy crimson cobalt green and white There were sweet cropped off-the-shoulder tops and culottes a great T-shirt dress with a tennis skirt and a kicky blue mini that flashed the crimson of inset pleats Giulietta has been long distinguished by a certain vintage-loving quirk that carries through to silhouettes but this season things took a surprising turn toward the body-conscious strappy bodysuits and hourglasses dresses abounded  Sizzis tennis references were subtly used though they were easy to spot if you knew to look for them bold white stripes seemed to have leapt straight off the courts and onto skirt hems and the legs of pants The lace of a pair of emerald flares was a riff on tennis balls and nets as was the collections lovely closing look a beige evening gown whose organza skirt came studded with big glossy cabochons Robots got a nod in geometric jewel and Plexiglass breastplate-like embellishments But androids arent without their flaws They have no hearts for one And while this collection surely had heart to it in places it felt a little bloodless Giuliettas idiosyncracies have served the label well before heres hoping well see more of them come Fall$$As more than a thousand people traversed the rush hourchoked West Side Highway and flooded onto Pier 26all dressed to the nines (or maybe the threes or twos given the skimpiness of a few notable looks)its fair to say that one of the very last things they were expecting was to be immersed in a contemplative experience Yet this is what they got from Riccardo Tisci on the night he brought his Givenchy show to New York City coinciding with the 14th anniversary of 9/11 There was no all-out gig from Rihanna and Kanye West (as had been the speculation when performances were mentioned) and no inaugural walk from Caitlyn Jenner which had been optimistically rumored given Tiscis strong credentials as fashions first champion of transgender models  Instead with the aid of his coconspirator the artist Marina Abramovic and the cooperation of a staggering sunset across the Hudson Tisci made his show into a meditation on the losses of 9/11 and on slowing things down in our heads perhaps to mourn but also to remember how lucky we are to be alive The audiencethe seated professionals and celebrities and the standing publicwere made to wait and watch for a good hour absorbing the spectacle of blue sky and white and pink-tinted clouds as Abramovics slow-moving performers dressed in white shirts and black pants acted out simple strenuous and repetitive ritualsone with a ladder another with a tree a third with a faucet gushing water Stop Abramovic seemed to be saying Slow down and feel something And meanwhile in the foreground the nonstop parade of personalities kept coming and kept on being photographed and Instagrammed  As far as style is concerned this was also Tiscis opportunity to revisit and refine the ideas hes been working through for his whole career This yearin which a Givenchy store opens in New York Cityis Riccardo Tiscis tenth at the house and there was a serene sense of celebration and coming of age amongst the clothes It was a collection which spelled out and repeated almost-calligraphic black and white variations of the same sentences Ivory slip dresses and rouleau-strapped camisoles with lace edges worn over excellently tailored black pants cut to taper gently over pointed shoes Supple crepe tuxedo jackets with tails soft kimono coats and transparent organdy trenches glimmering with jet embroidery Many many body-skimming sparkly silver shifts Aficionados of Tiscis track record in Paris would also have re-applauded the most spectacular of his couture dressesone with a degrade feather effect and another with leather patches applied on tulle in the shape of alligator skinwhich had never before been shown on live models (as opposed to showroom dummies) And then there was the face decoration taken to the nth degree of freakishly beautiful elaboration in studded golden jewelry tulle frills and lace That calm exposition of skill and taste which surely grows out of nineties memories will stay in the minds of everyone who was on Pier 26 tonight The tragedy of 9/11 can never be overwritten by any fashion showand nor should it bebut at the same time anyone who condemns fashion for concerning itself with current feelings is wrong too$$By now you know what to expect from a Greg Lauren show Vintage military fabrics pieced-together jackets hip-slung trousers and hand-distressing are his brands unwavering signatures Theyre working for him too Before taking their seats a dozen editors and admirers milled around Moynihan Station decked out in his vagabond layers so there was no confusing which stage was his Other labels have begun to embrace a sort of deconstructed nomadic look (Yeezy comes to mind) but Laurens take is less severe than many of his contemporaries Where other shows might have felt provocative and a bit dark Laurens outlook was all about moving forward while honoring the past and inspiring people to think about clothes differently That came through stronger than ever in his Spring presentation which opened with a captivating performance by 10-year-old dancer Lil'Mini Phoenix set to Nick Drakes Way to Blue I saw her dance a couple months ago and knew I wanted her to open my show Lauren said backstage Shes an example of this next generation of strong females who are saying Dont tell me what I should be or aspire to I really believe women are leading the way in creativity leadership artevery discipline Theyre breaking boundaries changing stereotypes How did that sentiment translate into the clothes Laurens women always look powerful in their army drabs and rumpled suits and there were plenty of those here But an expanded evening range gave the designer the chance to inject a little more sex appeal An ivory body-skimming silk gown looked 90s-era minimal at first but there were billowing swaths of parachute fabric spliced into the back I wanted there to be flow he explained There were also subtle dance references like a champagne dress with hand-placed strips of silk on the bodice which mimicked the casual but intentional way a dancer laces up her pointe shoes The final look was Laurens most experiential to date The halter neckline of a fluid jet-black silk dress was sculpted cast in resin and then plated with gunmetal He described it as part relic part liquid metal but on a simple beautiful silhouette It would make an interesting red carpet choice but our moneys also on the silk lounge pants and robe coat which offered a softer spin on the tuxedo$$The incoming march of a new generation in Italy has begun and the fashion world finds itself standing back spectating on the sudden arrival of a multicolored sparkly life-affirming parade Alessandro Michele is in the spotlight as the Pied Piper of changea risk-taker and revolutionary who has not so much wiped the slate clean at Gucci as doodled all over it colored it in stuck sequins on it and tied it up with a grosgrain bow His Spring lineup was a very much amplified filled-in decorated and dazzling accessorized extension of the girly geeky vintage-like collection that he launched last season in the incongruously dark nightclubby surroundings of the show space the company had been using since the 90s when Tom Ford was grooving the disco 70s at the brand As Michele said backstage surrounded by a visual kaleidoscope of glittery flower-embroidered satin chiffon Lurex knits brocades and trimmings Its a big trip Of course I am interested in personal style and quirkiness There are things here that look vintage but dont really exist as vintageits the illusion of it Im not nostalgic Id like to shake it up again Michele is having none of the slick Gucci aesthetic that descended down through the tenure of his predecessor and former boss Frida Giannini This time he led his army of Gucci girls into the open air and constructed an aristo-domestic set with a printed carpet against the backdrop of a disused train depota plot of broken-down old industrial Milan which if we are to be romantic about it seemed something like a metaphor for Italian regeneration  What Michele is doing is certainly very Italian in its references which (if we are to be geeky about history) run the gamut from Missonis Lurex knits to Roberta di Camerino to Walter Albini and generally use the wonderful era of expressively luxe postwar dressmaking fabrics as a playground Michele said he has been thinking about the Renaissance and the 1970sboth great eras for Italy in their own waysbut that his whole point is to express personality and emotion through his clothes Fashion is close to tenderness he declared apologizing for his English I havent slept for two days  No wonder Apart from his sweeping in of a whole new aesthetic the vast variety of components in the collection must have kept Michele and his teamsand the shoe bag hat eyewear and trimmings communities of Italyworking around the clock for months The results are mesmerizing close-up Gucci loafers that get pearl-studded heels damask slip-ons with ridged soccer soles green boots with flared heels and ghillie laces in rococo blue satin a pair of Mary Janes with studs made of bullet casings Thats just for starters If Gucci manages to supply even a fraction of all this stuff to its stores worldwide it could have riotous demands on its hands$$The heritage of Guy Laroche reads blurry at best in our collective consciousness so when London-based designer Adam Andrascik took the reins of the storied house earlier this year it was his turn to write a new set of rules From that first outing it was already clear his vision dramatically overstepped the Parisienne tropes of Monsieur Laroches couture past driving a more youthful urban sensibility that returned in his second collection for Spring  Stretching a tall tale of tropical dystopia to describe his sophomore effort Central Saint Martinstrained Andrascik showed an upbeat cross-section of ladylike daywear collaged with wartime references such as the khaki jacquards traced with palm fronds that occasionally returned as mirrored appliqus for evening Swinging between touches of military detailing and ultra-feminine froufrou his barely there shirting off-the-shoulder jackets and miniskirts benefited from the strictness he employed via brass button symmetry yet faltered into unnecessary complication when ruching and knotted hemlines took center stage  Among the complex slice-and-dice of dvor jacquards and muddy striped separates Andrasciks talent with a biker jacket rose once again to the fore with that Laroche staple energized in multiple permutations today In leather it featured a daring cutout shoulder and chain details (perhaps a sultry choice for Jada Pinkett Smith who sat front row in Falls gold-dipped sweaterdress) yet for Andrascik it seems the more streamlined the better Cases in point a Perfecto lapel folding down a straight double-collar coatdress and a series of scooped-back shirts They channeled that same millennial grunge that his double-waistband denim captured in spades$$The timing couldnt have been better Just as the models streamed out together for Haider Ackermanns finale the clouds broke outside the Palais de Chaillot and sunshine poured in through the giant Eiffel Towerfacing windows lighting up a parade of gorgeous pastel panne velvet Ackermann has a reputation as Pariss broodiest artiste known for a dark moody palette and a penchant for draping that sometimes errs on the droopy side He was up to something a bit different today and it started with his dreamily hued velvetin lemon yellow blush pink pale blue and lilacwith punk-but-pretty mohawks to match Weve seen color play a starring role at other shows this week notably Dries Van Noten and Lanvin but here it was an authentic surprise Its likely nobody walked in wanting a pair of green chartreuse satin pants with a dusty pink and faded blue waistband but some of us walked out that way  The other virtue of this collection was its diversity Jacket-wise Ackermann put a lot of options on the runway from shrunken leather motos to languid mens dressing gowns to a double-breasted blazer trim enough to tuck into trousers Pant styles meanwhile ranged from Friday night at the club (black leathers) to Sunday morning at Les Puces (frayed and patched cargos) Only laser-cut leggings stood out as a mistake in a lineup that was otherwise pretty free of them The lacy pantyhose peeking out from under waistbands was a styling effect strictly runway only Dresses werent the focus but the ones he did show scored high on the wearability meter especially a bias-cut black velvet number worn with a matching jacket$$Everything old is new again at Halston Heritage For Pre-Fall an archival feather hat designed by the late legendary Roy Frowick set the gears turning and for Spring it was a vintage Halston silk scarf in a macro orchid print that inspired creative director Marie Mazelis At todays preview she also namechecked Cuba specifically referring to the candy-colored crumbling splendor captured in photographer Robert Polidoris images of Havana The jetsetting appeal of recent seasonsinspirations have lately included Halstons jaunts to China and Acapulcohas done plenty to increase the glamour quotient at the brand and it did so here too if subtly That orchid scarf led to larger-than-life prints (Halston was known to spend around six figures a year to keep his studio full of his favorite blooms) which were used on blouses and diaphanous caftans The Polidori pictures informed Mazeliss palette of aquamarine coral and tangerine  Movement was central here whether in the accordion-pleated chiffon overlay that topped one simple sheath or the fistfuls of jangling paillettes on the shoulders of another At times it felt like the HH team stuck too literally to the shapes of Halstons seventies salad days with their one-shouldered frocks plunging halter dresses and wide-leg glamour-puss jumpsuits Next season it might be worth adding a bit of that eras gleeful hedonism into the mix$$The woman for whom Hellessy is designed does not wear short shorts said Sylvie Millstein during the presentation of her latest collection and she certainly wont have to Long fluid gowns in striped cotton-linen and ochre-colored silk commingled with easy blush-toned pajama suiting and tuxedo-tailed strapless bodices worn over wide-leg trousers promoting a different kind of cool entirely An off-the-shoulder blouse with a thick black band across the chest and creamy white poet sleeves gathered at the cuffs a light silk trench in that same shade of ochre boasting a literal twist of fabric at the back It was a vision of summer in the city where the frayed hems come on the edges of a boxy tailored T-shirt-style topnot your cutoffs  The presentation took place in Chelsea at Lori Bookstein Fine Art where fate would have it that the current showHiroyuki Hamada Paintings opening September 10served as a kind of underlining to Millsteins aesthetic philosophy an artful approach to a certain elegant restraint Its about not doing too much said the designer who looked to colors found in a city summer and primarily relied on all-natural fibers (linen cotton silkand really what more do you need in the sultriest of seasons) She found her inspiration in the rooftop parties that absorb New Yorkers social lives from June through September with all of the skylines sparkle (here seen in a V-neck cocktail-ready cotton lam shift its Art Deco silhouette echoing the era of some of Manhattans most lauded skyscrapers) and upward thrust (represented by the bold vertical stripe of a column dress and mid-calf-length extended pajama shirt tunic) implied therein$$Fashion history is Hwan Heos obsession The Korean designer has a quite nerdy approach considering his almost scholarly zeal in referencing a precise fashion decade for each collection I call it the Critique Collection Project because the process is close to a research or a study he said during a presentation of his Spring lineup Every Critique Collection is numbered like chapters in a fashion history book He has already reached Critique Collection Project n9 which was dedicated to the Great Depression Not a very lighthearted subject but the designer was undeterred He found a picture from the 30s of a little girl working in a factory imagining her dreaming of being free and playful instead of having to face such a harsh reality Hence a collection where the severe tailoring of masculine workwear (in pursuit of historical truth real cutting patterns of that era were used as references) was softened by the use of fun feminine colors Ribbons and strings added a gentle yet playful touch allowing the outfits to be transformed in a constellation of diverse silhouettes following the personal mood of the wearer In another literal nod to the prohibitions of that time not a bit of fabric was wasted Instead of trimming the excess material the ingenious Hwan Heo made it into a multitude of inventive shapes leaving the ends loose and un-hemmed Case in point was a voluminous coat in black-and-white houndstooth jacquard with an orange belt apparently it was cut as a geometric square but on closer inspection it revealed hidden wings made from uncut fabric folding and cascading on the sides for a graceful ruffled effect$$Trying to describe Herms is an exquisite form of torture to a non-French person Somehow the foreign tongue (I mean English) simply cannot find words to explain the ingeniously crafted superfine fabrics and leather it uses without sounding pretentious (a well-known Anglophone phobia) Even worse the values of the house are so restrained and so coded as to be next to undetectable to the uninitiated Being in on them involves far more than being alert to the occasional H logo on top of a bag strap or congratulating oneself for recognizing that Herms silk scarves are being incorporated into clothing as Nadge Vanhee-Cybulski did (again) this season  In a nutshell Herms is the essence of the cultivated inbred French point of view that if you have wealth it must be spent so that it doesnt show except to those of your class And by the way a woman must never blunder by trying to be sexy appear to wear makeup or have done hair Foreign women are half-blind to all these nuances as they run counter to most of our instincts yet still we are obsessed with cracking the secret codes Both Kris Jenner and Janet Jackson are apparently amongst the intrigued They were onhand at the show to view how Vanhee-Cybulski would set out the Herms principles for Spring  She did it with a simplified sequence of blue-black tailoring and grid-patterned black-on-cream tops and pants and mustard-color dresses in cotton and leather accessorized with large quartz and clear resin cuffs Something of Vanhee-Cybulskis background as a former design director for The Row figures in here Shes brought a sense of relaxed city-sportiness to the picture showing Herms trainers with many looks and dialing back on the horsey heritage for the moment Its not showy fashion that is being sold here more a carefully calibrated sense of a lifestyle which consciously rises above trendiness For those who want to belong to it the quality of the materials will be explained in the ritual of buying at Herms where the quiet mystique of all this Frenchness is fully laid out$$Today was the 30th anniversary of Herv Lger and show-going lovers of the label shuffled in wearing none other than the houses perennial frock the bandage dress The attire was predictable but creative officer Lubov Azria threw onlookers for a loop when it came to the runway There wasnt a bandage dress in sight We were thinking How do we evolve this line on the runway where we didnt do one bandage technique  said Azria backstage Sure the decision not to include the popular body-skimming piece synonymous with the house seemed risky but Azria managed to keep the DNA of Herv Lger alive in other ways First from afar many of the minidresses looked like bandage dresses and moved like bandage dresses (they barely moved at all) Those features were enough to keep the die-hard lovers of the staple happy For instance there were still those hourglass-hugging silhouettes this time seen in jacquard fit-and-flare frocks which came in black and cream with crisscross netting dipping down into the dcolletage But Azria was also able to infuse some new techniques like floral appliqus on tank dresses which nicely traced the body to emphasize the waist There were also some woven cords on a sleeveless dress slightly curved for a slenderizing trompe l'oeil effect  But it was Azrias introduction of trousers on the catwalk (before she had only showed leggings) which provided a true dose of cool Jacquard pants were striped or patterned flaring out at the kneean effect that seemingly elongated the legsor were woven into slouchy or fitted jumpsuits The new direction still contained that bold va va voom factor of a bandage dress but it wasn't as forwardand with it Azria could potentially gain a new set of fans$$To witness a designer evolve improve and flourish is one of the greatest pleasures of regular show attendance Today Holly Fulton hit that career-narrative uplift with a collection that put away some of the childish (albeit diverting) tics she had previously favored for a focused yet imaginatively soaring kaleidoscope of clothing Her inspiration was the artist Eileen Agara name shamefully new to this reviewerwho collaged repetitive patterns taken from nature Hence the calligraphic ruffles on the starfish-studded opening dresses that echoed the languidly spiraling tail of a seahorse Or the injection-molded abstract floral silicon appliqus and glinting Swarovski protoChaos Theory myriads that danced across these carefully proportioned silhouettes Fultons feel for harmonic color combinations was in tune and she paid rewarding diligence to often-overlooked categories that included an exactly precise denim and chambray section Previously Fulton was lovable for the walk-of-shame tousled fiercenessvery Londonthat so often inflected itself in her collections Today that was eclipsed by unapologetic virtuosity Backstage Fulton said We were trying to use repetition to create cohesion that reflected the almost psychedelic eccentricity of Agar My favorite quote from her is Ive enjoyed life and it shows through like a transparent skirtshe basically spent many of her latter years being semi-naked in translucent garmentsand we tried to incorporate that idea of something strong feminine and light$$It was all about childhood in the Caribbean And growing up around uniforms We had such high education and we couldnt do anything with ithigh education and low living quarters So it was about cutting up and altering that school uniform as we did  Shayne Oliver was wearing a long striped knitted column dress as he gave his articulate coda to Hood By Airs radically chopped-up schoolyard collection after a show to which the notes had been printed on a detention card registering many misdemeanors A journalist earnestly asked Oliver for his position on gender-neutral clothes as there had been equal numbers of men and women wearing spliced and suspended skirts and dresses on the runway Which is meant for which To Oliver thats hardly a burning issue anymore At this point he replied patiently we are wearing Hood By Air just as part of the family Its odd how things come around There was a fashion movement in the 90s called deconstructionism which mainly came from then-marginalized and poor young designers who bonded in basements in Antwerp and London In some ways Hood By Air is their 21st-century successor working to take apart conventional garments shrinking the components and making something new and unrecognizable out of them using zippers and the language of bondage paraphernalia Still Hood By Airs collective way of working is different and in many ways more successfully social revolutionary than those who went before many of whom eventually became absorbed into the commercial style of mainstream minimalism For one thing HBAs expression is far more exuberantly sexual fun and democratic than the intellectually exclusive 90s crew For another the HBA ethos is genuinely at the leading edge of a social change that has swept through legislation this year in ways former generations never have dreamed would come to pass And for a third Hood By Air is a brand that actually sells It doesnt look like highfalutin fashion butand this would never have happened before eitherits welcomed as part of Fashion Week recognized as a now-unmissable draw for international buyers and press One up for the credibility of New York fashion$$We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold Thus begins Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas gonzo maestro Hunter S Thompsons ever-entertaining account of how not to be a reliable journalist and the source material for this evenings almost-as-diverting House of Holland show Strictly Holland was inspired by the labor-of-love Johnny Depp flick from 1998 So the sometimes jeweled sometimes embroidered insects that oozed down his clothes were approximations of the hallucinatory special effects mustered for that production while the bulging ostrich feather shoes and appliqus were nods to the abysmal 70s motel decor Depps Thompson bugged out on in the movie  The first look featured a crazily patched field jacket on a model styled to approximate Thompson himself and the bucket hats that ran through the collection were more hat-tips to the reprobate author Head-fry colorful cactus-print shirtdresses nerd-chic pulled-high sports socks queasy abstract jacquards and you-really-shouldn't-mix-those color combinations including lime green and orange added to the maximalist overdose Thompson and Holland although separated by decades and disciplines made for intoxicating bedfellows$$If you can remember them afterwards British music festivals can often be wonderful Trouble is they are almost always extremely wet Forget Burning Man think Soaked Everyone Today Alasdhair Willis evoked these dubious delights by creating a runway of trodden mud on which he relived the three stages of typical Brit Festival experience via the medium of clothes First optimistic anticipation In they bounded wearing ripstop fishtail parkas in sunny dgrad pastels under a deludedly light layer of deconstructed outerwear This included a powerful remix of the trucker jacket in shades of olive and camo The shoes a key category for Hunter included an interesting hybrid of desert boot and the specially-made Vibram sole used on the labels heaviest-duty Wellingtonhere rendered in pastel panels for fashion consumption Next postinevitable downpour came adaptation Rubberized coats peppered with drawstring ringlets and botanical flecked semitransparent parkas wreathed in guy rope ribbons were meant said Willis to give the impression they had been hastily assembled to fend off the rain Wellingtons appeared in more dgrad pastel Camo parkas in crunchy-to-the-touch treated nylon obscured rather unfortunately a fine section of colorful patched gingham shirting By the end sheer abandon had set in Its still raining but Hell Yeah A medley of oversized baseball jackets-meet-ponchos came variously peppered with patches (including the Beatles Yellow Submarine) or with suspended fringes of more ribboning Hunters metamorphosis from farmers favorite to front row draw (Salma Hayek and Luke Evans were among the attendees today) began when Kate Moss Sienna Miller and other It Brits started wearing the companys Wellingtons at Glastonbury a decade or so ago So riffing on that transformative moment seems a fair way to advance Williss ambition to further Hunter as a youthful lifestyle brand Backstage he recalled his own first festival Glastonbury 1985 I saw Echo & the Bunnymen And it didnt rain Some guys have all the luck$$Since debuting his first collection for ICB earlier this year Makoto Takada has carefully cultivated the seeds planted by his predecessor Prabal Gurung As he settles in for his third season as design director Takada is revealing a bit more of his own playful sensibility while still filtering it through the brands working-woman narrative  The starting point for the collection was the photography of Vivian Maier a Chicago nanny who found success posthumously when undeveloped rolls of film shot by her in the 50s through the 70s were discovered and published But instead of riffing on the retro styles seen in her work Takada translated the inspiration into a witty exploration of hidden talent and secret fulfillment Takada liked the idea that Maier who toiled undiscovered for decades didnt need anyones affirmation to value herself So sprinkled through the collection are tiny surprises that only the wearer might notice a structured blazer pleated so that in motion a flash of nude crepe is revealed a pinstripe constructed from raffia and black wool trousers with a sheer grid created using dvor which revealed a minuscule square of skin For the woman who buys this its something she can enjoy just for herself said Takada Shirting remains the brands bread and butter and this seasons pice de rsistance according to Takada is a whimsical take on the classic a blue oxford shirt with a fountain of delicate feathers sprouting from the chest The feathers had been carefully hand-stitched in India so that they would hover over the fabric like a little cloud I had this idea of someone who works in the corporate world showing up in this shirtits in the dress code but also not in the dress code said Takada Its that rebellion and irony It reminds me of how Vivian took photos of regular people but there was always a narrative$$Iceberg has seen a long list of designers come and go over the years Jean-Charles de Castelbajac Marc Jacobs the Dsquared2 brothers and Giambattista Valli have all held the top post Alexis Martial was the most recent recruit until he graduated to Carven earlier this year Now Arthur Arbesser who launched his own label a few seasons ago has assumed the role and its a sign of his buzz factor and Milans growing enthusiasm for nurturing local talent that the turnout in the front row was the best it has been at Iceberg in recent memory I feel quite honored and happy to be here Arbesser said backstage but at the same time I feel [the line] needs a good injection of fun and energy And a clear message He certainly brought zest to the endeavor this afternoon embracing the brands heritage in knits and not skimping on color or pattern either The bonkers work of the Italian artist Enrico Baj was a jumping-off point informing the bold print on a silk dress and the plastic badges pinned to the chest of some pieces creating a loose sort of military vibe But the knits are what really resonated With their preppy-psychedelic sensibility and body-conscious fit theyll be catnip for the street style posse Theyll also be a pleasure to wear which will make them attractive to more restrained types too It will be interesting to see what Arbesser does for Fall when he can really have a go at sweater dressing We expect to see an even bigger crowd at round two$$In the center of Iris van Herpens venue today lying flat on a plinth was the actress Gwendoline Christie The Game of Thrones star remained there motionless for the whole show even as the trio of animatronic trees surrounding her began to move as if they were weaving the soft fishnet-like dress that spread out in a circle around her Quaquaversal is the name Van Herpen gave her new collection It means going off in all directions and backstage she said thats how she approaches her work collaborating with scientists artists biologists and now performers  Van Herpen is one of contemporary fashions few true conceptual thinkers one for whom process is as integral as the finished product Indeed like Hussein Chalayan this season with his disintegrating dresses she asked us to reconsider the very notion of a finished product with her growing one Beyond the performance piece there was much of interest on Van Herpens runway where the designer worked hard to combine craftsmanship and technology She started with sportswear skirts tops a leanly cut little dress It was normal stuff but for the laser-cutting and hand-weaving The silhouettes were pure and simple so the materials could shine and shine they did on crystal-studded chain-link dresses of the Paco Rabanne variety Only here the chain wasnt chain at all but a clear synthetic material that made the crystals look as if they were floating without a tether The most exceptional work came toward the end of the show on a pair of looks as delicate as a fine tracery with so much negative space they were more not there than there Laser-cut fishnet gowns appeared to have been made from a weightless silvery metal With their futuristic aspects these pieces of Van Herpens will be fitting for Christie when she hits the red carpet for her two holiday blockbusters The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 and Star Wars Episode VII This relationship could be very good for both of them$$She will always be a rock chick at heart but its clear that the Iro girl is going placesshe has a real job now for one and so does her guy so they need more daywear options to make it all work Of course theyre most likely to be in a field where slim-cut cropped leather trousers and destroy-chic jeans are the norm When not worn with basic fine-gauge cotton tanks these might be paired with a breezy popover with openwork details or a multicolored pink print only the most daringor laid-backwill don the striped shirts with deliberate mothy perforations during office hours Other pieces especially the jackets will go just about everywhere These included a salt and pepper tweed number with frayed edges and textured wrap jackets in khaki ecru and black with or without sleeves cinched by an obi-inspired belt (For him spring heralds slim-cut suits too) Since its inception Iros biggest star has been the leather bomber in iterations with cool names like the Ashville the Zefir and the Jone The gangs still all here in neutral colors although theyre being upstaged by offerings in silver gold and saffron that with a tunic or printed maxi dress swapped in move easily from the office to a holiday by the beach Speaking of city and shore an ever expanding repertoire of flats presented a number of hybrid ideas from a pointy boot-meets-slide style to a lace-up-as-thong rounding out the offering were gladiator styles and tennis shoes this season with an iridescent finish$$Isa Arfen collections never lack for charm This season though designer Serafina Sama laid it on even thicker than usual Taking her cues from vintage photos of Balinese women 70s-era exoticism and rave culture in the 90s Sama conjured a rather ladylike trip to the tropicsone of the acid variety perhaps Sama wasnt particularly literal with her references The sarong-style wrapping and tops skirts and dresses layered with ruffles were one type of nod to Indonesia the collections copious black-and-white check it turned out was another (Apparently checked textiles are popular in Bali who knew) The 70s homage was more abstract reflected in the airy hothouse-appropriate shapes of button-downs coats and jackets and in the emphasis on olive drab in the palette Samas decision to steer away from styles plainly associated with the 70s was cannythere have been umpteen versions of the safari jacket since that legendary collection by YSL but none like Samas which came A-line shaped and embellished with graphic grosgrain appliqu Nor were there any flares here or for that matter any Isa Arfensignature culottes Samas trouser message this season was crystal clear capris capris capris Rave culture meanwhile was the most abstracted reference of all Mainly it contributed to the mix of as Sama put it poisonous colors in stripes and a silk-screened tropical floral print So far so charming but the collections real grace notes were to be found in its fabrications an Isa Arfen specialty The PVC-coated linen of a printed kimono coat was one standout another was the crispy cotton blend of the checks Sama also made a concerted effort to use materials that looked crushed or crumpled as though theyd been packed into a suitcase That choice helped to give this rather dressy collection its atmosphere of informality Ditto the way Sama layered her ruffles all askew Ditto too the fact that this collection as a whole came off deeply impractical Individual pieces could easily be worked into a womans everyday wardrobe but they seemed aimed more at the woman for whom every day is an adventure A charmed life to be sure$$Isabel Marant pulled together a thumping 80s hip-hop soundtrack for her show today even though the influences on her new collection skewed more North India than South Bronx The Parisian designer has made a name for herself by filtering that elusive French girl cool through a distinctly global lens She was a seasoned traveler from an early age thanks to her bohemian upbringing and has a knack for cherry-picking and then deftly reconfiguring dress codes and traditions from all four corners of the planet For Spring Marants divining stick led her to the rich colorful textiles of Rajasthan Its a place the designer has visited for inspiration in the past but given the free-spirited eccentric 70s moods that seems to be lingering in the air on the runways that milieu still feels relevant That being said the silhouettes recalled the rounded billowy shapes of the 80s overall Style-conscious festival girls who have spent the summer in breezy vintage-inspired peasant blouses will be swapping out their skinny jeans for harem pants come spring if Marant has her way The MC Hammer favorite isnt exactly the easiest look to pull off but in this case the styling was right Layered up with sequined leggings and elevated with Gorky-style heels the look took on a new vibe What with all the sparkling textiles that have been around in the collections somehow a Lurex gold jumpsuit gathered at the ankle rolled down to the waist and worn with a lightweight sweater felt right for now The global nomad hand of the clothes might have been familiar territory for Marant but its still likely to give her fans a reason to revisit her store$$The pulsing strains of Die Antwoord reverberated through Issas London show space today the first indication that creative director Jamie OHare was looking at his nature girl through a somewhat twisted lens for Spring only his second runway outing for the label Name-checking films like District 9 and Tron backstage he described the blown-up details lavished across cocktail dresses and Resort separates as both futuristic and organican altogether chilly segue for a brand built on graphic eveningwear yet one he tempers with swathes of delicate texture and shine A slew of opening looks paired flat planes of white silk crepe against an encrusted latticework of metallic embroidery transforming the designers abstract research of stem cell structures into glistening cocktail fare Later body-con knits came tiered in black and white bands of lacing and plastic eyelets creating eye-catching frills and multilayered contours that hugged in all the right places Balancing that stricter offering flattering tank dresses fell into handkerchief hems that matched the delicate butterfly effect of lace jersey caftans in cerulean and optic white fractalstheir swirling architectural prints later morphing into an unfortunate trippy tie-dye that slowed the momentum of an otherwise appealing minimalist streak It preceded the monotony of slinky wrap dresses that followeddraped concoctions in sheer self-stripe silk space doughnut prints and bands of aquarelles that will slip easily into the summer party circuit though with little fanfare Pieces like Lily Donaldsons floor-length gown however (its circuit of jacquard trailed with white lozenges) spoke a little louder of Issas raison dtre no-nonsense glamour with a bold feminine allure$$Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have been experiencing a runway renaissance of late One place you wont find a straightforward take on the house signature though is at Issey Miyake itself At the brands show designer Yoshiyuki Miyamae continued to test the horizons of what a pleat can be and do introducing a new baked stretch technique that molds pleats into the body of a fabric The most compelling looks in the collection were the ones that featured wavy baked stretch pleats with contrasting colors printed into the curves as the sculptural garments moved they had a spring action a little like that of a Slinky The motion was surprising but subtleyou could easily imagine wearing these pieces The looks with the most instantaneous appeal however were the bright color-blocked ones punctuated with touches of fringe Miyamae and his team had a tropical theme going here witnessed in the collections palette but the raffia textures of the fringed pieces nicely underlined the hothouse atmosphere There were also net tops with a similarly earthy charman unusual tone for Miyake a house that hews to a synthetic aesthetic as a rule but a welcome addition to the brand vocabulary Pleats remain the star at Issey Miyake but there are new supporting players$$The vintage Levis revival currently under way has got premium denim-makers in a bit of a pickle Do you try to propose an alternative look or offer new jeans that accord with the vintage vibe J Brand did a bit of both this season in a collection of denim and ready-to-wear that emphasized time-tested silhouettes Most of the innovation was in the materials Head of design Mary Bruno did yeomans work developing ultra-lightweight denims and dyeing and distressing  gossamer cotton-linen blends to look like denim such that J Brand may indeed find itself with a monopoly on jeans suitable for the dog days of summer Brunos other key proposals were to offer a trouser jean which looked particularly natty in optical white and indigo-dyed stretch denim made in vaguely 70s-ish swimwear shapes She wasnt trying to reset anyones denim agenda here this collection was more about proposing solutions for women who want to keep wearing the denim they already like when it gets really hot Thats enough to make a market not so much to make news$$You could call it London Fashion Weeks soft launch J JS LeeJackie Lee to her friendshas the advantage of showing first on the London calendar She is South Korean and emerged from Central Saint Martins MA course in 2010the minimalist yearwith a bumper crop of alumni who founded their own businesses in London Simone Rocha Thomas Tait and Matthew Harding of Palmer//Harding were all in the same class taught by the late legendary professor Louise Wilson Lee has taken her collection away from its beginnings in rather structured tailoring in neutral colors toward something more fluid and airy withsurprisepops of color bold stripes and a few dappled black-and-white prints The result a pleasantly breezy wardrobe that could translate well as daily wear in those cities that are baking in high summernot London particularlybut then again Lee is from Seoul$$The J Mendel customer has long been a certain type of Madison Avenue grande dame one who comes for the furs from the incomparable atelier and sticks around for the romantic frocks to tuck under them But the designers recent red carpet successes with a younger crowdTaylor Swift Maria Sharapova and the Sports Illustrated model Hannah Davis among themhave opened up a new demographic one just as attuned to major red carpet moments as self-styled Instagram snaps And who can blame Giles Mendel for wanting to be there for both The day looks he had designed for Spring seemed crafted with this crew in mind with urban-minded accents such as graphic prints grommets straps and slits Asymmetrical micro-pleated skirts were either made micro-length or cut to the ankle paired with roomy tunics or boxy tees In what felt like a more-is-more take on what the kids are wearing bandeau tops were paired with snakeskin wrap skirts or light-as-air organza ballroom styles that while masterfully renderedThe pleats open up and blossom like petals said Mendel and they didultimately missed the mark (Skin may be in and snakeskin too but the kids who love you for old-school romance wont necessarily love you for their going-out-clubbing looks) As the glamour level rose things loosened up A narrow micro-pleated column dress with a built-in bandeau had massive appeal on and off the hanger while a black-and-white abstract-print silk chiffon gown with cutout bodice was its own wind machine moving with extreme graceit could be just the thing for next awards season A creamy textured silk crepe anorak patterned with graphic black abstractions inspired by Japanese woodblock prints hit just the right note charmingly sporty even when paired with a matching intarsia cropped mink that Mendel explained was intended to disappear into the pattern when popped on top And as for those furs a pair of long vividly patterned yagasuri intarsia mink vests For the plane Mendel said with a winkwill prove just the thing to tide over the J Mendel client old and new until fall when the big coats come out$$For a brand in times of transition figuring out the best way to trigger the reset button is often the most pressing challenge Thats perhaps why this season JCrew was going back to its roots or as president and executive creative director Jenna Lyons put it Pulling from the things that feel undeniably like us Gingham nautical stripes tomboy favorites such as the shrunken military jacket Its easy to distinguish the moving parts to the JCrew look one that Lyons herself has made so appealing to women the world over in the last decade All those classics made an appearance in the presentation today only often they were tweaked in subtle ways One sun-bleached menswear-inspired plaid shirt was paired with a matching bias-cut skirt that was covered in glittering sequins while another was recast as an off-the-shoulder peasant blousewhat is fast becoming the answer to the crisp white button-down The brands knack for preppy print-on-print combos came through particularly well in a graphic blue-on-blue gingham shirt and pants ensemble With new womenswear designer Somsack Sikhounmuong set to make his official debut next season it will be interesting to see which way those familiar JCrewisms will go$$Gargantuan 80s leg-of-mutton sleeves Galactic knitted pantsuits Ruched body-con dresses Keith HaringcumVivienne Westwood squiggle prints Gold metal chokers Square-toed metallic spike heels of the kind that havent been seen since the 90s Lets put it this way There is a lot to process at JWAnderson A womans odyssey was what Jonathan Anderson was calling it backstage The idea that if you took a date in time and sliced it through and looked at what everyone was doing at that timewould it mean anything And would it matter if it didnt But lets shelve the intellectual parsing of that complicated quote for a moment Perhaps only Anderson knows what it means and it doesnt matter if we never do But to state it plainly from another angle the thing about Anderson at this very moment is that he is someone possessed of the ability to jumble together unexpected ideas and make a new sentence of them It is the sentence that reads You didnt know you wanted this beforebut now you will That of course is the essence of fashionsomething that makes you feel a bit queasy and puzzled for a few seconds but then just as quickly shoots into the bloodstream as desire Jonathan Anderson classifies as an experimental avant-garde designer in that sense a leader But at another just as crucial level hes a clear-headed maker of product Break down this collection and its full of items to take away just as they are many ribbed knits as tunics and pants neat pantsuits in compact jersey fluid printed midi skirts a frill-fronted A-line dress and a tracksuit covered in net Then bags worn two at a time cross-body like panniers But back to what the man said A clue was in the audioa mix of Fran Lebowitzs words about Andy Warhol and his manipulation of fame and Rihannas Only Girl (In the World) I was watching Martin Scorseses documentary about Fran Lebowitz and liked what she said her commentary on a moment She spoke about creativity What does it mean Maybe it only means something to me said Anderson Then he paused and shrugged as if something Lebowitz said chimed with him on the level of being a designer in an industry that is constantly running at high speed and of course whose work is instantly exposed at every turn Obviously he said Theres always another show Not that he should worry about that today This was a moment that is certain to keep people talkingand buying their Spring trophies for plenty of time to come$$A gigantic red ball of fabric was pushed across an open expanse of concrete floor by a tiny barefoot child in a mans white shirt Models walking in ones and twos followed him dressed in fractured tailored pieces sliced half-jackets in navy and gray cloth dresses overlaid and underlaid with white shirts cut on the diagonal or worn back-to-front and tied on with cotton tape Halfway through the show to add to the oddness the designer himself appeared seemingly an adult version of the boy leading a white horse across the stage in an interlude before more models came on What was this A surreal symbolic dream or a fashion nightmare where clothes are to be bought in asymmetrical fractions Backstage Simon Porte Jacquemus who recently won an LVMH Prize in its young designer competition tried to explain the state of mind he was in when he plotted this oddly trancelike and unsettling parade His emotions seemed raw and vulnerable The collection was called Le Nez Rouge he said because he had been sick afflicted with a red nose and personal troubles as he was designing You know my collections are normally about the South of France and the beach and happy things Well now the Jacquemus girl is not smiling he said Without spelling out what had happened he added My friends my family knows It is harsh to call judgment on a very young designer who is clearly under stressas are they allas he tries to make his way with feeling in the hard world of fashion commerce Though his narrative held in a huge arena of a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris didnt quite hold up in the space it didnt obfuscate everything Jacquemus has going for him Backstage his navy pants long narrow skirts and white shirts looked crisply cut and as attractive as they always do in stores$$With his recent turn toward tailoring and a more minimalist point of view its easy to forget that Jason Wu got his start as a dressmaker This season he seemed eager to remind us of his origins Glamour was the one-word description his show notes proffered The first look out was a trenchcoat sure but its edges were softly frayed and its storm flap was ruffled Ruffles were the big story Cascading down the sides of a halter dress in a bright blurry floral print and fluttering at the neckline of the shows best look a gorgeous coral pink cocktail number they evoked Yves Saint Laurent Even a python-skin dress got the flounce treatment Here and there on the shoulders of a blouse and the sides of a somewhat too-stiff woven raffia dress those frills got the better of him Hes no YSL (heck probably not even Saint Laurent himself could live up to his legend now) but Wus output continues to mature The work that went into the bodices of a camisole and a T-shirt dress among other pieces was so intricate it looked more like a print than a patchwork of five different kinds of lace Otherwise there was a healthy amount of the sportswear hes come to favor lately Wu's tailoring is confident and a pair of black suits with delicate lace underpinnings looked great with flat strappy sandals Also tempting clingy knits in a mlange tweed for day and for evening in fine-ribbed silk with more of that saucy fraying$$Jean-Pierre Braganza invited some serious toe-tapping this afternoon in London The British-born Canadian designer spent his summer between the research rooms of the British Library and the blank canvas of his studio listening to jazz greats from Charles Mingus to John Coltrane But their freewheeling musical influence found its form not in the brightly-lit looks that made their way down the runway but in Braganzas improvisational approach to designing them I never liked jazz when I was growing up he said backstage But now the fact that its so structured and yet so chaotic really fascinates me That frenetic spirit translated into endless draping and deconstruction Hems were left undone and suits were radically reconfigured with entire panels left to hang loose This may all sound wildly experimental but in fact these clothes will do nothing to alienate Braganzas eternal muse that all-powerful female who on this front row lineup was embodied by the spiral-curled British songstress Ella Eyre The show found its headiest form in digital print dresses that drew on the visual style of the Bauhaus But come next spring the real standouts will be the series of white zip-skirted coats and crepe trench coats worn over diaphanous duchesse satin dresses All were subtle understated and executed with a lighter-than-air finesse As an aside there was a message in the fact that Braganza had eschewed his usually extensive show notes this time around You guys are going to hate me he said with a smile to the gaggle of journalists waiting backstage I want you to use your cerebral abilities to see the story for yourselves  Well perhaps because of the show's title Whiplashed which was taken from the Oscar-winning Miles Teller movie (tap tap tap) there's one word that immediately springs to mind upbeat$$Click through Jenny Packhams past 10 or so collections and youll notice a common theme Each one opened with an embellished dress So when the first look at todays show was a black and red floral-printed suit you had to wonder how Packham got there When she rattled off a few of her favorite musicians backstageMick Jagger Nick Cave and David Bowieit all started to make sense Packham was inspired by rock n roll legends who resisted gender strictures and werent afraid to indulge the more feminine aspects of their personalities Packham herself was dressed in an oversize blazer cropped pants and creeper brogues After decades in business it was only a matter of time before she started taking a page from her own personal style While the new emphasis on day-to-night dressing was promising the androgynous concept didnt quite translate for many of the looks The suits were a bit too boxy and Packhams clientele relies on her for glitzy embellishments not wildflower prints Perhaps it was just muscle memory but the glittering red carpetworthy dresses were the ones that stood out Consider Packhams most visible customer Kate Middleton Youd be hard-pressed to get her in a mannish blazer but the jade georgette gown with draping at the hip would work perfectly$$This is your brain This is your brain on screens If Jeremy Scotts latest collection had a subtextand its not clear that it didit was that our brains are going a little screwy due to overexposure to screens Check out the insane-looking cartoon faces on Scotts new intarsia knits Isnt that kind of how your mind feels after several consecutive hours of binge-watching UnREAL while simultaneously answering emails on your laptop and glossing Instagram on your phone Anyway The screen thing was very much an ur-text of Scotts latest effort with its digital television prints and trippy sweaters knit to look the way old television screens did when they went a little wonky That was all part of Scotts larger theme which was an homage to sixties era B-movies and sci-fi that he interpreted with his typical heaping of club-kid flash The eras tropes were rehearsed in everything from abbreviated A-line silhouettes to ray-gun prints to the paillette mesh that was an overt tip-of-the-hat to Cardin As usual Scott seemed to be having more fun making fashion than anyone else on the scene these days but the lineups buoyant tone didnt disguise the fact that this was a pretty disciplined collection The mens looks were eye-popping but they hewed to classic shapesguys with some daring in the fashion department might be swayed by a button down in Scotts scribble print or a leather biker spotted with white polka dots Lots of the womens looks meanwhile could appeal to customers outside the Jeremy cult to wit the tulle pieces with high-contrast sequin stripes or summery short sheaths covered in the scribble or raygun prints A cocktail dress black on top with a ribbon at the waist and a bouffant pink and silver brocade skirt was downright homecoming queen mainstream Scotts rigor was also demonstrated in his materials and his technique The paillettes on the opening look worn by Gigi Hadid for instance were bordered by seed pearl embroidery And Scotts deftness with textiles was witnessed best in the very simplest of his ensembles a matching cropped sweater and miniskirt set down in a cool spongy knit Nothing looked tossed-off here in other words just as nothing looked really truly nuts Scotts experience at Moschino seems to have convinced him theres some fun to be had too in selling tons of clothes$$Shes not too pretty but dressed well That was Ji Ohs summation of her Spring woman who had a kind of haphazard jolie laide and faintly aggressive quality The designers muse was tough and her presentation backdrop was a construction sitelike mishmash of signage Despite the streetwise jumping-off point the clothes bore all the hallmarks of Ohs signature pared-back polish Basics with a twist are the labels bread and butter (landing the line in doors like Barneys Harvey Nichols and Intermix) and this season offered them up in spades There were pinstriped jumpsuits and a plunging silk slip dress a cropped cowl-neck sweatshirt and easy wide-leg trousers Change is incremental in Ohs world of modern staples This season an eye for utilitarian hardware (snaps and zippers and buttons oh my) and a somber palette grounded in navy and white lent things a more androgynous edge in contrast to the punched-up reds cobalt and metallic silver of seasons gone by The real news here was denim It was the first time Oh had taken on the textile and she whipped a single wash into contrasting patch-pocket jackets (using the reverse) pull-on trousers skinny jeans and more Dressed well indeed$$Its no secret that Jil Sander Navy knows its way around a clean pattern But this season the labels variations on layering added a kick of cool to what could otherwise have been a buy-it-anywhere basic Silhouettes were enhanced by skirts and shirts with peplums (not the teeny-bopping out-to-brunch kind but rather smarterwith texture) that mushroomed out from under button-ups to create volume and a cinched waist There were also puffed ruffles which made for a pepped-up take on sleeves and pointed hems on skirts that resembled a mans waistcoat References to Henri Matisses cutouts came in jagged floral patterns that covered shirt and tank dresses in blue and white as well as in hot pink and citrus orange In a nod to Piet Mondrian a perforated shirt and tank dress were tiered into green yellow and blue primary colorsa well-suited complement to the classic linear silhouettes But it was the riff on athleticwear that turned basics into must-haves Dresses were reminiscent of deconstructed parkas fastened with horizontal elastic cording that cleverly created curves A white skirt in the same outerwear style had a strip of fabric that acted like a belt creating an unfinished empire waist that elegantly tufted out above the hipsa piece that could easily become a closet staple or a street style standout$$Disciplined Rigorous Precise Google Jil Sander and those three adjectives come up more than any others Fashion at this moment is moving in a different direction Spring is looking decidedly deshabille Whats Rodolfo Paglialunga installed at Jil Sander one year ago to do Remain faithful to the house codes even as memories of the founder grow fuzzy Go with the current flow Its a conundrum that all designers charged with heading up old labels must face After a couple runway shows that hewed to Sanders clean lines Paglialunga tried option two  An otherwise straightforward two-button blazer was sliced at the shoulder seams another jacket was cut away in the back and a third was deconstructed to look more like a pinafore than your standard double-breasted fare but the tailoring wasnt so radical as to be alienating The Sander-classic crisp white shirt got a revamp too in crinkly slinky sky blue silk with an au courant cutout at the midriff Rounding things out were the sort of slip dresses and wispy bits of silk that have been multiplying on other runways this season Straps spilled off shoulders and asymmetric necklines dipped to reveal the upper arm Cutouts proliferated not just at the waist but near the hem of a sheath or sliced vertically front and back on looser-fitting dresses Paglialunga is a talented guy but this collection gave you a twinge of the familiar It made you miss Sanders hard edges a bit$$Jill Stuart designs wearable hyper-feminine clothes with a woman in mind rather than a particular reference point From the first look it was clear Spring was all about an exuberant hip-shaking party girl There were yards of flowing satin from a languid slip to the designers new take on the voluminous high-neck blouse thats still trending right now It was easy to envision Studio 54 when a pair of superwide flares hit the runway but Stuart wasnt really that focused on the past I think this is just how girls are dressing today she explained backstage She used adjectives like vibrant dancy and magneticthe same words you could use to describe Solange Knowles who was sitting in the front row Stuarts following is a loyal one so the suede skirts and tiered floral gowns will no doubt generate long wish lists But a few of the pieces wont be as easy to pull off like high-rise satin culottes that spotlight your hips or a truly miniature ruffled bandeau The best looks emphasized texture but would still flatter a wide range of women like a shimmery ankle-length floral dress with a cropped sweater layered on top$$Bill Gaytten indulged in some Anglophilia at his John Galliano show this evening His was a gloss on the contradictions of British 20th-century style rather than a straightforward homage to any particular erathere was for instance a hint of a country gentleman out for a shooting weekend in Gayttens checked tailoring and meanwhile more than a hint of the punks who sneered at such men in his looks embellished with safety pins and studs  Rave-era anoraks and dress-for-dinner frock-coats also got a look-in on the Galliano runway But the standouts in this collection were indubitably Gayttens frothy dresses These came in various romantic barely there versions some bedazzled in sequins others paneled in lace and still more boasting tiers of demure ruffles The most eye-catching though were Gayttens polka-dot numbersthe graphic black-on-white pattern made for a nice counterpoint to the looks diaphanous cuts They seemed well suited to some modern-day Lady Mary of Downton famealthough the Lady Marys of today would likely be inclined to throw Gayttens spongy dun-color parka on over that dress before heading out for the evening British style is nothing if not eclectic Gaytten captured that quality well$$We like to think of ourselves as a coastal brand says Rachel Wilder-Hill the vintage-obsessed designer behind Joies easy breezy designspieces she says balance LAs laid-back bohemian side with a touch of Parisian chic As the great divide between high fashion and real women remains very present collections like Joie are becoming more relevant than ever thanks to their ability to tap into the little comfortable luxuries that women of all ages want to wear without the forage of vintage shopping nor the conceptual trappings that can often plague runway brands Its the little details that set us apart continues Wilder-Hill explaining the floral print on a braided silk slip dress This motif came from a scrap of wallpaper I found at a Paris flea market and had repainted by our incredible in-house artist While Joie began as a jeans brand in 2001 its evident that denim has taken a backseat to the expansive range of sundresses floaty shirting and peasant blouses that emphasize soft cotton fabrications for Springas gauzy voiles topstitched embroideries and broderie anglaise details instill a sense of decorative nostalgia in the dolman-sleeve silhouettes cinched with drawstrings and skinny plaited belts Some of the prettiest looks within the Spring lineup feature inserts of Victorian-inspired lacework their delicacy balanced by stonewashed denim or light suede keeping their historical leanings within Joies contemporary feminine frame$$In a light-drenched tent at noon on a sunny Sunday Jonathan Saunders set out to show his audience his true colorsas a designer of effortless breezy sensuous clothes Most of the collection was spun out of the success hes had with a certain bias-cut slip-dress design of a few seasons agoits paneled structure lends itself ideally to color-blocking and to matching and clashing prints that can be continually switched up So yes there was a lot of that in his Spring show but he also noted that it was the attitude of the bias cut he was trying to transmit by using trailing ribbon ties and shapes like wrap-over blouses and bathrobe coats Essentially of course Saunders is a colorist and print and pattern specialist of long standing in London and having acquired a new investor this showwith its expensively purpose-built venuerepresents a turn of the page on the business front He has acquired a new CEO and employees which he says is freeing him up to concentrate on being creative and on the detail of luxury finishings on the inside of his clothes Thats all good news for his following of grown-up women in the business political art and fashion worlds$$I think that women come to me when they want to get dressed up and feel strong said Jonathan Simkhai before his Spring 2016 show This collection proved that they could feel romantic too Technical lace embroidered macram and bonded burnout were rendered into figure-hugging cocktail frocks inspired by the tropes city-dwellers overlook every dayskyscrapers subway grates and scaffolding But it wasnt purely urban-minded The designer had spent several weeks this summer in Lake Como researching fabrics and developing a taste for country life as evidenced most winningly by the loosened-up cotton voile dress worn with low-top white sneakers (and less convincingly in a pair of embroidered basketball shorts) I think its one of those grass-is-greener things said Simkhai referring to the seasonal exodus of Manhattanites who repair to various country escapes during the warmer months Youre here and you want to be there or youre there and want to be here His idea seemed to be that with enough flounce and a little wiggle room (the type not necessarily encouraged by an embroidered macram trumpet skirt) one can manage both Simkhai a 2015 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist has developed a following for his figure-skimming silhouettes among those who vote with their Instagram likesbright young and often photographed things like DJ Mia Moretti who provided the shows soundtrack and model Devon Windsor who sat front row in something lacy black and body-con And happily for Simkhai thats the thing about bright young things They always need more party dresses$$It's become a bit cliched to talk about masculine/feminine now Everyone's talking about it observed an endorphin-pumped Louise Trotter after this interesting overload of a show I wanted to play more with the role models of a male and a female she said Almost uniquely this is a subject upon which fashion can be more explicit than words for clothes are our most potent codifiers of gender But lets try and keep up We started with classically-for-Joseph neutral menswear-touched womenswear Monochrome T-shirts skirts and sweats both held together and defined by twist and turn There were plenty of unexpected rips and twists whorls of construction There were bengal stripe versus pencil stripe viscose silk shirtdresses and skirts plus the odd drop of conventional feminized suiting teamed with sheer tailored mens shirts with girlishly ribboned cuffs Then a shot of acid yellow and patent shine black leather signaled what Trotter saw as a break phase in the narrative from girl dressed as boy toand please bear with me heregirl dressed as boy dressed like girl This allowed Trotter to blend pretty gleaming vintage brocades into monkish military-touched pieces trailed by nylon webbingthis second movements equivalent to the knots and bows wed just seen in the first Her expression of this mood became less gilded and more repressedyou know manlyuntil a last look that took us back near full-circle to the first To see some of the still-shifting ground Trotter was attempting to survey here see the Fall collections from Gucci or Craig Green As an overviewand a point of viewthis Joseph collection was both dizzying and fascinating$$For Fall Josie Natori mined Istanbul for inspiration For Spring she trained her eye a little farther east The whole collection is inspired by Asian painting said the designer at todays presentationher first eveningwear-only outing Natori said she was fascinated by calligraphy and wanted to experiment with brushstrokes To that end an asymmetrical dress featured a straightforward black-and-white brushstroke but Natori also used crystal embellishments to create the same effect on a white column dress and a black basket-weave gown (one of the strongest looks) You really cant go wrong with black and white she remarked dressed in a chic black shift dress But color wasnt off the table entirely The designer honored the season by playing with vibrant slightly off-kilter color combinations An expertly tailored fuchsia strapless tunic layered over orange stovepipe pants was a memorable look Some of the kimono-inspired ensembles verged on being too literal but Natori hit her stride when she incorporated elements of the traditional garb in subtler ways as in the case of a pea green raw silk strapless number with an embellished obi-inspired neckline That said Natori almost shyly is one of my favorites$$Fashion shows with all of their required hustle and flow can actually prove to be something of an obstacle for smaller design houses as the average Fashion Week affair has become more like a performance piece (or a gesture of how much money a given brand has the ability to shell out) and less about its actual purpose which is you know to show the clothes Environmental worries (seating charts The music The lights The lack of heat The oppressive heat The location) are the immediate concerns and the details of a given collection often get lost in the shuffle So when it came to his Spring 2016 show Juan Carlos Obando wasnt taking any chances I want you to turn this jacket inside out he said at one of many private appointments he is holding today in a small space near Saint-Germain proffering a cropped waxed organza version with generous bell sleeves Look at what weve done The piece felt as smooth and as light as cotton and yes the details (stitches seams lines) were perfect This perfection is a sticking point with Obando who has leaned hard into the technical aspects of his manufacturing this season Hes employed exclusive Italian mills hes hired more hands on deck to supervise the construction Count the stitches I am so proud of these details he said highlighting the bias-cut trim of a silk tank top the corners at the edge of a scarf tie I never want to be a brand that looks or feels cheap I hear enough from my friends about how clothes look one way on Instagram and then entirely another in a store And as Obando has realized the chasm between an Instagram like and an actual purchase lies in the physical here and now How does it feel how does it look and most important is it worth it Obando launched with Neiman Marcus and Net-a-Porter last season and a plethora of trunk shows has made him increasingly aware of what women want less gowns more separates Things that can be worn to work and then adjusted (either by adding a skirt or a heel) for evening engagements Comfort a sense of romance a hint at a vibrant inner life Its not about an impossible inspirational womanits about how the clothes make them feel he said in what has become a bit of a refrain among designers this season These were elegant easy looks based around decadently heavy silk separates (those Italian mills) like a camisole with a tie-waist and furls of fabric below the shoulders (the addition of a skirt slit on the bias turns it red-carpet-ready) a slip dress that loops and ties around the wrists striped fishermans pants (those perfect seams again) Deceptively simple pieces were worked with subtle details shirtdresses with scarf-tied necklines that trail behind you as you walk a column skirt slit in the front and back to move like trousers with the stitching (the yarn the same as those used in baseballs the designers nod to a recent trip to Cuba) picked out Its about courtship Obando said Im obsessed with courtshipthe whole thing my designs seeing them on a hanger in the store trying it on I am courting the women trying to convince them to fall in love Judging by these clothes hes going to have a very full dance card come spring$$Its probably been a while since youve wornor thought aboutJuicy Couture But after years of bad news for the brand a glimpse at its Spring collection reveals that business is boomingjust probably not where you live There arent any Juicy stores left in the United States but China has nearly 100 Los Angeles and Dallas are important cities for Juicy too but its clear that the real money is way east As such it was admittedly difficult to parse the sprawling Spring lineup since it was designed with a different market in mind The collection was separated into several delivery groups each one driven by an of-the-moment trend There were boho florals a longtime Juicy signature as well as graphic 80s-inspired logo tees and neon tweed jackets which felt vaguely reminiscent of Jeremy Scotts recent collections for Moschino Here in New York designers have been embracing a more natural crafty approach to dressing but Juicy was all about the opposite bright colors short hemlines and graphic prints Still there were a few straightforward well-constructed pieces that would fit into even the most edited wardrobes like the crisp ponte jackets high-rise flared jeans and foulard-print pants which read like elevated pajamas As for Juicys infamous velour track suits theyre still aroundthey even inspired Juicy Sport a brand-new equally colorful new label of athletic wear$$This was the 10th Paris womenswear show in the cutely unique Julien David narrative His is a label conceived in France but entirely manufactured in Japan where he lived for a decade Seven years after launching he has 100 stockists and says that 40 percent of his sales hail from the country in which his clothes are made So it seemed right and proper that todays collection was a gentle exploration of the similarities and differences between his two home nations The differences were articulated most clearly in his contrasting  use of sunflower and cherry blossom prints or workwear-lean jackets and carpenter coats and pants The panniers on asymmetrical-pleat skirts could have been sourced from Marie Antoinettes wedding dress or Diors Bar suit and servedif you stretched it a bitto produce a Gallic version of the ornamental exaggeration ohashori There was plenty of denimin dungaree dresses more carpenter coats topstitched jeans and appealingly curve-leg four-button pants Nmes France is where legend has it this most ubiquitous cotton twill originated and despite the role of North American teenage culture in ubiquitizing denim it is (arguably) Japan where some of todays finest quality is milled Davids is from Okayama Vinyl laminated over embroidery on elastic-cinched flute-hipped T-shirts fleur-de-lis fil coupes undone Brigitte Bardot bustiers as outerwear and resin-backed cotton crop tops were among the further passing pleasures here The soundtrack was a willfully strange collision of Needle in the Hay and Brush Your Teeth while the mustachioed gentleman on a silk jacquard romper worn beneath a full black skirt and bustier was Henri the designers grandfather This was Jean de Florette meets Swept Away marinated in Davids personal preoccupations Together these ingredients made for an interesting and quietly progressive pot-au-feu Or nikujaga$$There were whoops and cheers even before the crowd caught sight of the first look at todays Julien Macdonald show held at the centuries-old Smithfield Market In a fashion world where trends rotate on an ever faster axis theres something comforting about a designer who holds fast to familiar terraineven when thats as revealing as the spangly flapper-age dress that opened proceedings Though you wouldnt have guessed it until a ways through this mammoth 52-look collection this past summer Macdonald traded the club podiums of the Balearic Isles for the black-sanded beaches of Bali I properly chilled out for the first time in my life he said post-show There was so much inspiration to be found in the tranquility and raw natural beautyand all the traditional textiles  When Macdonald started sketching out Spring 2016 it was these Balinese batiks that he drew on They provided the collections biggest moment the designers main-line menswear debut Tropical prints showed up on beach-y tunic tops and silk shorts that Macdonald says he has been trying to get around to creating for the past 20 years But I didnt want to just do camp menswear he said counting Puff Daddy and Kanye West amongst those whod have a taste for this kind of directional dressing Yet Macdonald being Macdonald he couldnt resist adding sparkles even here Forget the finale gowns and the intricately woven web knits that remained his mainstayin the mind of this Welshman its always going to be all about the rhinestones even for the boys$$Junya Watanabe set his show in the National Museum of Immigration History in Paris an immense Art Deco place built to celebrate the cultural benefits of French colonialism when that sort of thing was thought to accrue to the glory of the republic On the way in guests passed a piece of contemporary art which gave some people pause a wooden boat filled to heaving point with bundles wrapped in African fabric It took but a small leap to associate that with another scene at Dismaland where Banksy's boats filled with miniature models of immigrants floated on a disused Weston-super-Mare holiday pond  An uncomfortable choice of surroundings then for Watanabe to show us a collection themed around African fabric patterns on a cast of white models whose faces were decorated with pale fleshcolor globules mimicking tribal scarification marks It was hard to know which way to react Watanabe is as known for his quiet pacifism and his silent rebellious streak as he is for never giving explanatory quotes Was it a commentary on fashion's long record of annexing the dress art and religious artifacts of other peoples Should he be criticized for doing that And how does he view that from Tokyo living in a country whose culture is constantly appropriated by Western fashion (as seen only this week in John Galliano's geisha-themed show) Anyway There was no denying the anxiety of watching Watanabe's show through the prism of all these contextual and moral questions A pity because at the beginning there was a clear view to beautiful loose smocks and shirtdresses some with draped belled sleeves and semi-sheer fabrics some of which involved black matte lace constructed in a pattern which merged a sense of camouflage with animal pattern After that came two looks with a knitted tiger amid leopard pelts thrown over the shoulders as wraps also great No doubt the African wax-print looks which followed will be prove as easy and commercial summerwear in stores but at the same time they will leave some feeling uneasy$$When presented with the opportunity from the WCFDA (an initiative from the CFDA and W Hotels) to take a research trip rather than going abroad Kaelen Haworth struck out on an all-American road trip Stopping in New Orleans as well as Austin Marfa and Dallas Texas the designer was struck by the various landscapes particularly the harshness and graphic appeal of the desert And so came a collection sparer and more sophisticated than some of seasons gone by Shapes skewed toward a certain utility even at the dressiest A floor-skimming T-shirt dress was boxy and came with patch pockets though its generous slit and fantastic chartreuse hue added plenty in the way of appeal Likewise the versatility of a sleeveless jumpsuit in elephant-gray suede didnt need to be explainedit fairly cried out to be teamed with your everyday kicks or sky-high wedges and a clutch Haworth continued last seasons explorations with knitwear and while you wont find much in the way of the slouchy or the oversize her clingy ribbed knits are top-notch The sparseness of these pieces was a promising development for the label still it wasnt all minimalism and no play Shimmering silver linen culottes and a cowl-back metallic rose gold slip nodded to the labels more feminine proclivities of the past in a soign new way$$Karen Walker has a thing for the esoteric Last season she was inspired by obscure British sci-fi series Sapphire and Steel and this season it was a remote town in Russia that provided her jumping-off pointand the only link between the two is that youve probably never heard of either Backstage before her show Walker explained her inspiration We came across these photos taken in the 80s of this unmarked town just north of Moscow called Star City that was a secret military training base for the Soviet Unions space program And there were all these photos of these funny folksy chintzy Russian sitting rooms but with space suits and space gloves Walker always a fan of intriguing juxtapositions said she wanted to contrast the folksy domestic and ordinary with high-tech cutting-edge utility And she continued a shot of glam Because it was quite an elite glamorous city It was difficult to make heads or tails of the idea But then the show started If Walker is a little bonkers for using such bizarre obscure reference points there is certainly a method to her madness She was able to suffuse elements of her inspiration into an utterly wearable collection A small detail like an extended exposed zipper on high-waisted pants recalled the training jumpsuits astronauts might wear without hitting the viewer over the head with the revelation You wouldnt think that space suits and peasant blouses go together but Walker somehow made it work Supple gold leather pieces (a nod to the Mercury space suit) were styled with Edwardian blouses and ribbed sweaters (and sometimes topped with a jaunty necktie) There was an 80s vibe to the whole collection which exerted itself most boldly in the acid-washed denim pieces Walker also ingeniously added a horizontal zipper to two floaty white dresses allowing the wearer to zip off the bottom and create a shorter dress or top It proved that utility neednt be slick or complicated to be effective$$Outside the Kate Spade New York presentation a balmy scent of flowers seemed to douse the surrounding sidewalks Chief creative officer Deborah Lloyd had partnered with the floral company FTD placing almost 30000 flowers in the space After a harsh winter when that first day of spring breaks how relieved we all are to buy our first flowers at the bodega she said of the inspiration And that feeling was evident in the clothes Flowers were everywhere mostly in patterns There were florets in grayscale shades splattered onto an A-line skirt and in abstract black and white on a shift dress delicate daisies dotted a slouchy jumpsuit  But it was the more pared-back use of floral printsand springtime colorsthat hit home The subtle outline of blossoms was charmingly laser-cut onto the hem and neckline of a daffodil yellow fit-and-flare frock and the same pattern was smartly infused into a polished skirt set Reminiscent of a stylish stroll to the corner store there was a charming white sequin shift dress striped in candied tones of pastel rose sunflower royal blue and apricot But the real winner A black strapless cocktail dress covered in petal appliqus was the freshest and most perennial piece$$Katie Ermilios designs have quickly become staples of the red carpet trotted out by celebrities like Jessica Alba Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez With the designer's Spring collection which emphasized curve-skimming silhouettes and self-created luxe fabrics it was obvious that her focus hasnt wavered from occasion-dressing Taking tennis as a theme Ermilio translated the aerial views of center court into sleek strapless gowns empire-waist jumpsuits and fitted double-faced silk skirts converting the fresh palette of the racquet grounds into a smooth color wheel of Pepto pinks and sage greens  Ermilios use of linear patterns smartly complemented her body-hugging fits A pinstripe duchesse dress mirrored the grids on the court while the tonal checks in emerald gave a high-waisted trumpet skirt less of a froufrou effect and more structure But Ermilio also put a pointed spin on her eveningwear specialty by creating separates that could easily become elevated daytime pieces For example there was pair of Betty Drapertype pink checked high-waisted trousers that could just as easily be worn with a classic white tee or Ermilios matching crop top in four-ply silk Not just for cocktail hour the designer seemed to say and we couldnt agree more$$A collection titled Chinatown might conjure up images of girls in silk qipao dresses and embroidered pajamas But the New York City neighborhoods mash-up of Chinese traditions crowded streets and diverse residents has been a constant source of inspiration for Katie Gallagher throughout her career The designer has lived and worked in the area for nearly a decade and for Spring she translated its singular energy into clothes that were easy minimal and just a touch charming Its really just about my take on Chinatown and what I smell feel and see when Im there Gallagher said That came through in the color palette which was predominantly black and white with pops of red and goldlike Chinese gold or a taxibut it was also felt in the delicate textures Still the stone-washed silk slip dresses would no doubt stand up to the Mott Street hustle some of them had a vaguely Eastern influence with apron necklines Gallagher also whipped up a slouchy cherry red tote as a nod to the plastic shopping bags you pick up at Chinatown markets That tongue-in-cheek accessory lent a softer more playful element to the collection It felt fresh for Gallagher whose oeuvre is characteristically more edgy and conceptual$$Designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon love a far-flung unexpected destination for their Kenzo shows Those who made it out to the Nineteenth Arrondissement this morning though were transported to a different milieu in more ways than one Gigantic white arches were stacked on the runway and painted with the shades of pink and peach that recalled the sun-washed architecture of Mediterranean towns such as Portofino in Italy   Kenzo is a brand that's global and nomadic at its core so having endless summer vacation vibes built into the set was a nice touch And with their new collection the New York duo addressed how a well-traveled modern woman can put some of that feeling into her everyday wardrobe The word swimtimates will sound unfamiliar to some but essentially it takes the traditional idea of a bathing suit into your lingerie drawer an approach to summer dressing that cool young things on the festival circuit will understand There were compelling renditions on the runway that were worth flaunting knit geometric pieces that peeked from under spaghetti utilitarian minidresses and updates on the 90s bodysuits that were paired with printed miniskirts  The fanny pack that other 90s favorite got a makeover too and the best example was fashioned military style with three small pouches on a waist-cinching belt Lim and Leon have a knack for making practical and Instagrammable accessories like this though the ornate chandelier earrings and bold necklaces were a little misplaced within the sporty graphic context of the collection The sensible ankle-strap gladiator sandals that came with spiky reflexology footbeds put the skin-baring printed looks on a fresh footing$$The last time Kimora Lee Simmons formally presented her KLS collection it was back in December when her label made its debut In the meantime Simmons has been busyshe gave birth to a son and opened up the KLS Kimora Lee Simmons flagship in Beverly Hills in a jewel-box space as Simmons described it today The new KLS collection also demonstrated that Simmons has spent the intervening months evolving her labels point of view if only slightly There was the same emphasis on graphic pencil dresses executed in flattering ponte blends and a similar smattering of sporty pieces like a pair of slouchy trousers with a track-pant stripe down each leg But Simmons included a broader range of silhouettes this time aroundfull skirts and minis Grecian-draped dresses and gowns boxy blazers and a fairly broad array of trouser shapes The best of the latter was the mannish pair of slacks done in a slightly shiny pinstripe which the designer showed with a matching halter-neck vest It was a sexy feminine take on a classic menswear look Another new development here was Simmonss expanded range of separates of which the standouts were her crisp shirts with sheer panels and leather biker jackets with sleeves that zipped off to three-quarter-length All in all the collection felt more rounded than the debut and it had a lot more spark Onward and upward$$For the runway debut of her year-old label Koch Christelle Kocher turned the lower concourse of Les Halles into her venue and set the showtime for 900 pm With all the mall shops closed and commuters dispersedand with no actual runway save for the orderly clustering of gueststhe cavernous brutalist space gave many clues to her brand positioning Kocher pointed out how the show space was non-elitist yet in the heart of Paris within five minutes of the Louvre yet adjacent to the citys busiest public transport station accessible yet unpredictable Her casting ranged from Soo Joo Park and Charlotte Free to a girl handpicked off the street to her neighbor in the 20th arrondissement But even without a single auxiliary aid the clothes broadcast how the intersection of couture detailing and streetwear styling could lead to a kinetic distinctively contemporary collection Kocher also serves as the artistic director for Maison Lemari one of the specialist ateliers (in this case feathers) owned by Chanel subsidiary Paraffection Embroideries undertaken by sister ateliers Montex and Lesage embellished sports bras basketball shorts T-shirts and parkas showing how craftsmanship remains a designers ultimate power play The tank bedecked in feathers and bling the tracksuit encrusted with tulle and the bodysuit paved in iridescent paillettesif these pieces arent destined for performers known by their acronym aliases (MIA and FKA twigs were looking at you) then they demand personalities with comparable moxie Still its too early to tell whether Kocher is trying to degrade flashy or elevate trashy Likely both At least that was the impression made by the earrings and rings she created with Goossens the couture jewelry atelier They spread across fingers and crawled up ears like mangled marvels$$Junichi Abe launched Kolor more than a decade ago as a mens line one aimed at a certain type of stylish man the kind for whom a sweatshirt is never just a sweatshirt and whose sneaker selection is not necessarily a reflection of his athleticism Abes comparatively fledgling womens collection now in its second official season has a markedly similar aesthetic in mind military touches on parkas and vest pockets narrow-cut cotton trousers topped with netted tulle and of course sweatshirts though here they boast jersey backs or pleated tulle trimmings along with the occasional frilled high collarVictoriana meets Champion Abe develops all of his textiles himself and they are unique to the house so what might feel de rigeurhammered silver and gold lace metallic-stamped organzaupon close inspection is subtly spectacular the lace here pleated miraculously to show its shiny underside Layered oversize polka-dot T-shirts were worn loose off the body and over houndstooth printed shorts an exploration of what a brand representative (Abe was not present at the presentation) called where good taste meets bad taste Ballooning skirts appeared to be made of parachutes if parachutes were also made of tutus Abe has never been afraid of a little color and bold stripes reigned supreme with flashes of fluorescent tones put to good use on trims like that of a standout bomber jacket slim and olive and just the type of layering piece any person needs in their wardrobe for an unpredictable spring Shoes a new undertaking for the designer came in three styles a thick ridge-soled kitten-heel pump a platform brogue and a platform sandal inspired by one from the men's collection the top rendered in richly earth-toned suede The aim of this collection an aide explained is in step with much of this season not to dress some impossible woman but rather real women specifically the Kolor Man's girlfriend At least they're in good company$$KTZ designer Marjan Pejoski and partner Sasko Bezovski decamped to New York Fashion Week last season saying at the time that they werent sure where theyd be unveiling future collections because they liked the idea of going where the spirit moved them As it turned out they wound up back in London this season and it seems that Pejoski was seeing his hometown with fresh eyes If theres one inescapable sight in London these days its the construction site This town is evolving at speed The new KTZ collection seized on both the imagery of the construction site and its augury of a remapped cityscape signs at the club space where the KTZ show was held tonight blinked the phrase The World to Come These clothes had a very different tone from the ones shown by KTZ in recent seasons The labels signature club kid vibe remained in place but Pejoski cashed in the nomadic vibe of previous collections and conjured a gritty urban feeling in its place Out with the tribal motifs and heavy mirror embroidery in with chain-link patterns paint spatter and wordy patches redolent of pasted-up flyers This seasons most intriguing evolution meanwhile was found in the tailored looks like a sculptural trench coat made out of a fabric that resembled a crumpled brown paper bag The suggestion was made explicit by Pejoskis fluttering handle embellishments which he also used on looks in black leather There was a menacing quality to this collection Nothing too overt though there was a gothic note to some of the looks What read as dark was Pejoskis way of spotlighting the visual elements of the city we generally try not to seethe blur of litter and temporary fencing around the lots where shiny skyscrapers are going up You got the feeling that the club kids who comprise the cult of KTZ number among the things unseen that will be swept away when the new city emerges Pejoski proffered the optimistic The World to Come tonight He might equally well have opted for The Last Rave$$The French sportswear label founded almost a century ago by tennis champ Ren Lacoste had the good sense in 2010 to install Felipe Oliveira Baptista at the creative helm If they were looking to jazz up the brand with youthful verve and crisp urbanism for which the Portuguese designer was then becoming known thats exactly what they got Which is to say at the mens and womens Spring collection today tellingly few polo shirts could be spotted and there was little croc insignia We may see some Olympic inspiration as the rest of the collections play out but not every brand can lay claim to it the way Lacoste can The label will once again dress the French Olympic delegation as the athletes in Rio make their way around the opening ceremony next year And there is a historical link Lacoste himself was an Olympic medalist back in 1924 Thats how Baptista arrived at the theme of flags for Spring channeling the victorious moment an Olympian is draped in his or her countrys flag upon winning gold He abstracted fragmented and recombined any number of national bannersFrench Swiss Japanese Americanany number of ways across shirts tanks shorts jackets (often tied around the waist) ponchos and otherwise simple suits Against that kind of kaleidoscope an all-silver jumpsuitalluding to those shiny blankets athletes wear for warmthstood out all the more The closing looks with their jumble of stars and stripes all jostling for attention couldnt have made a more provocative statement without crossing over into trite rainbow territory Ultimately said Baptista its about peace and diversity$$And bringing the heart soul and attitude back to Paris fashion please welcome    Mr Alber Elbaz Theres a little bit of a fightback against one-note compliantly market-obedient fashion going on at the moment and how nice it was to see Alber Elbaz putting Lanvin out there on the front line tonight He staged his Spring collection literally as theater placing the Lanvin name up in glittering lights at one end of the runway and sending out a show he said was a manifesto More on Elbazs underlying thoughts later In the moment it was the fast pace of his girls and their almost fierce range of character that turned this into a hit Lanvin variety performance The show moved swiftly through acts First black and white daywearpants and blouses with balloon sleeves or rippling flounces were followed by chic-simple silk dresses and sculptural cocktail numbers Parodies of body-exposing draped jersey red carpet gowns underpinned with nude corsetry gave way to madly glittery party things with a wacky finaleof busy Lanvin souvenir prints featuring patterns of shoes and bags and funny graffitied handbags But back to the manifesto Elbaz described in a preview how hed been struggling to work through the puzzles confronting designers in a digital age What is relevant today Is it need or provocation Can fashion and theater coexist He concluded that he should try to show all-encompassingextremes and just as importantly leave evidence of his work in progress We saw that human touch in the black dresses that were collaged from several types of lace and the lines of white basting stitches left in the folds of a black gazar skirt Still there is little need for backstory explanations when the transcendent desirability of clothes speaks as directly to an audience as it did tonight$$Lela Rose did a lot of hiking this past year and this season she wanted to bring the overgrown fields of wildflowers she stumbled upon during her rambling walks onto the runway The challenge then was how to incorporate floralsa done-to-death spring motifin a new way Rose was more interested in the endless variations  present in nature than anything else so she injected her blooms with surprising hits of metallic and neon pink and yellow for a twist on the classic pattern She also played around with texture and embellishments In addition to her signature fil coupe there were metallic tweed dresses hemmed with fringe jacquard stamped with metallic and even a blush skirt and shell top combination that made a case for crochet after dark  Rose is perhaps best known for her feminine and romantic dresses and while those were on full display the designer also showed shes willing to forgo some of the sweetness for a little freshness A blush jumpsuit would have been saccharine with a full bow at the waistinstead Rose left the knot slightly undone A white shirt and short combo which almost appeared to be made from a sporty mesh turned out to be made from a perfectly country clubappropriate white eyelet Her willingness to get outside of her comfort zone worked in her favor for the most part but it also led to a few missteps A gray knit dress felt a bit out of place and some of the crystal embellishment verged into tween territory  But Roses customer is not necessarily after anything groundbreaking and there were plenty of looks that were just plain pretty A white organza gown embroidered with white flowers would make a stunning wedding dress while a cotton poplin shirtdress with a wide metallic hem proved that Roses grown-up elegance can indeed be artfully translated for day$$The Uniqlo and Lemaire collection goes on sale Friday at Uniqlo stores including the one here in Paris near the Palais Garnier We spied at least one editor plotting her purchases on her phone Im planning on spending a thousand dollars another confided Christophe Lemaire and his partner Sarah-Linh Tran have been instrumental in setting the current vogue for a covered-up calm yet alluring silhouette For women who crave the look (and men theyve also done a mens range with a restrained uniform-like sensibility) the chance to get it at Uniqlo prices is too good to pass up  Back at their own label Lemaire and Tran continued to work within their familiar framework Fringed scarves tied high on the neck and leather boots with woven espadrille soles gave the collection a slightly Spanish flavor Otherwise the tailoring was away from the body perhaps more than usual with side seams curving around the legs of pants causing them to bell at the hem Lengths were midi and longer and aside from a single off-the-shoulder top there was little in the way of skin Skin is something this show could have used more of A couple of the models were swimming in their artist smocks and the dress-over-pants situation felt heavy for a Spring collection Were not calling for a volte-face here just recognition that the collection tilted a touch too austere That said there was romance if you looked hard enough Je suis belle on me la dit (Someone told me Im beautiful) was printed in lilting script at the bottom of a soft white blouse Indeed the model who wore it was$$A brazenly colorful Leonard show took place just steps from the Andy Warholwallpapered faade of the Muse dArt Moderne where a new retrospective on the artist opened last week Whether sheer coincidence or timely homage the collection which remains overseen by Parisian designer Yiqing Yin stayed loyal to the Leonard archivesno soup cans bananas or hibiscus flowers But the saturation of hues dynamic pattern arrangements integration of graphic text and repetition of screened images all traced back to an unmistakable source Yin cited an urgency for what she called a livelier look when describing how the filmy printed organza lacquered eel skin and woven leather sneakers and sandals all appeared triple-dipped in primary pigments But the show introduced these elements gradually the opening grouping featured faint rainbow crosshatching with the diaphanous skirt prettiest of all As the lineup transitioned from white as its anchor to red and then to cobalt blue Yin applied increasing creative license to the heritage slick Windbreakers and color-blocked dresses with deep draping and frisky cutouts were the most street-influenced shes gone so far In some cases too much print mixing turned chaotic Backstage and off the runway however these same pieces proved rather refined The museum retrospective happens to be called Warhol Unlimited Leonard can pursue this same artistic intensity and distinctive vision as long as it accepts that some of its longtime customers might not be willing to come along for the ride$$The Far East has been exerting an influence on some of this seasons catwalks China and Japan are obviously more than booming markets paying homage to their cultural heritage while enticing a massive customer base with a huge spending potential is on every brands radar At todays Les Copains show creative director Stefania Bandiera was following the already ripe trend Backstage she mentioned a muse who was a modern Madame Butterfly a contemporary geisha an educated traveler an art lover Being a contemporary geisha might seem like something of an oxymoron but Bandiera appeared positively unfazed Kimonos and samurais cherry blossoms and peonies exotic birds and birch forests Ming porcelains and lacquered reds camellias and Silk Roads With the exception of Marco Polo all the obvious references were present The collection was built around the elaborate jacquard and knitwear techniques for which Les Copains is known Circle skirts with asymmetrical hems were paired with folded bustiers cinched at the waist with elasticated obis or worn with thick hand-knitted micro tops short peplum dresses were cut with an elegant origami draping effect High-waisted trousers were elongated and fluid they were topped by short sporty blousons made with what Bandiera called virtual illusory knitwear a sort of virtuoso technique of weaving an extremely thin yarn to achieve a delicate barely there look They added a modern energetic spin to a collection that despite all the overly literal hypercharged references looked quite balanced and wearable$$Every designers worst nightmare Johnson Hartig just lived it when UPS lost a pair of boxes in transit to New York City containing not a couple but 20 to 30 of Libertines key garments for their Spring show Fortunately this seasons offering was a larger one than usual for the label but Hartigs team still had to scramble for 48 hours to make tonights show come to pass A punkish DIY ethos has always characterized the designers work and on tonights runway there it was writ large (Its also the subject of a forthcoming Rizzoli coffee-table book about the label out later this month) Had the show notes not told of the calamity youd never have guessed it had occurred Here was a collection as deliciously profuse as any of Libertines past efforts with inspirations that included fluorescence cell research and Staffordshire dogs The latter came after a World of Interiors spread on Hartigs home decreed that Johnson Hartig is making Staffordshire dogs cool again And so the traditional porcelain pooches came to be one of the collections reigning motifs seen sparkling on the front of the killer opening coat or printed all over a caftan The fluoro cells lent the clothes a goodly dose of Day-Glo and appeared as electric-looking microbes on a mens sweatshirt microscopes could be spotted among the eyes There were also Buddhas beakers and perfume bottles on various toppers Speaking of outerwear (a Hartig forte) among Springs highlights were a cream-color trench with ambiguous drippy-looking blobs rendered in pink studs and a stunning brocade coat with the wordswhat elseJoie de Vivre emblazoned across the back More references more fabrications more fun Look at the great Bergdorf Goodman exclusive hand-painted clutches from illustrator Donald Robertson who sat front row alongside one of the loftiest iconoclasts of them all Iris Apfel On the bags youll find Morticia and Gomez Addams a crimson pout a forkful of spaghetti and God knows what else Heels meanwhile came tricked out with Day-Glo plastic chains How does the Libertine woman walk with all those chains clacking at her feet you ask As she does all things unapologetically$$Theres no doubt that Lisa Perry knows how to create a summer-ready wardrobe and today with temperatures surging up into the 90s her light dresses in punchy shades could not have been more appropriate The collection was a direct response to the artist Robert Irwin's series of paintings Whos Afraid of Red Yellow and Blue And Perry was evidently not afraid with pieces like a shift dress in bold Piet Mondrian tiers of black white red yellow and blue and a swing dress dotted with geometric shapes in the same color palette Perry also used jewel tones in a set of cocktail looks a royal blue dcolletage-diving dress and a high-neck crimson frock For those who prefer more toned-down hues rather than the standout color wheel there was a charming set of little black dresses including one with spliced sleeves and a dickey collar and a midi dress with patent-leather piping Minimalist adornments elevated the more pared-back pieces A black linen tunic had large grommets on bell sleeves while a white halter dress used the grommet as a loophole for the neck strap   In addition to the muted and primary color palettes Perry didnt forget her signature shock of hot pink It was there in a long T-shirt dressa perfect piece for anyone who fears nothing beyond the red yellow and blue$$Im interested in leather techniques and innovation said Jonathan Anderson I want to work with that and to sharpen the edge He was speaking at the conclusion of a Loewe presentation that threw out hard-to-define imagerya bit spacey a bit 80s but in another sense totally grounded in a house reality Give or take a couple pairs of plastic-wrap trousers and transparent pants the show Anderson pulled together was essentially a brilliant walking exhibition of accessories He is a curator with an eye for placing multiple products in an interesting context and making them wantable from many angles Take the jewelry Once youd seen the gold bracelets with their gold fringes pouring down the hand the eye was inevitably drawn to the bags and the variety of things that were happening with the signature Puzzle shape I wanted the bags to articulate the look to electrify it said Anderson The house of Loewe is an old established Spanish fine leather company but Anderson understands that nothing could be duller than to dutifully put a luxurious leather coat with a matching bag His project is to de-bourgeois-ify the context and thats how he came up with the device of using man-made materialsPVC injection-molded syntheticsnext to the traditional I thought what else could be like a second skin Whats really clever is the way every look can be parsed down to desirable components Where there are impossibly wearable plastic wrap pants there is also a regular sweater with a sheer yoke destined to go straight to retail Where theres a showpiece tunic covered in smashed mirror pieces so are there dozens of buyable shard earrings Alongside the avant-garde Puzzles there are just as many made in beautiful leather and suede Equally as smart is the placement of the wholly normal within this new hyper-styled arrangement There was nothing at all outrageous about the superfine patchworked suede tracksuit in this showits the sort of leisure purchase Loewe has been selling to its existing customers for decades Now maybe a fashion-bent trophy hunter will be looking for that sort of thing too In that way Anderson is keeping everyone happy editors and photographers wholl want to shoot the extreme image as well as fashion-conscious shoppers and the people whove been buying Loewe as part of a lifestyle for years Not to mention the brands owner LVMH which must be standing back and admiring what Anderson is doing for the bottom line by now$$And here are the handbags in the back if youd like to see them too Ah yes the handbags Longchamp sells a great many of those Since 1993 more than 32 million examples of one model aloneLe Pliage its signature nylon or all-leather totehave dangled from tasteful wrists around the world Which made Sophie Delafontaines question a telling one for by placing this ready-to-wear collection at the front of her presentation and tucking that core product away at the back Longchamps artistic director was making a statement Were not just all about about the bags capisce Which is kind of true With great restraint Delafontaine resisted any urge to garland her RTW-clad lookbook models with too many of her handbags But when she didand once you had seen both front of presentation and backit became apparent how closely the design notes of the two categories aligned So a sweet simple graphic and slightly oversize T-shirt of soft pink cut by thick black lines at the waist and sleeves matched exactly the colorways of a leather reversible tote next door That pink brushstroke print featured on the clothes (most successfully on a summer-night white zip-up coat) as well as the bags as did the stripes in monochrome and two shades of green Ditto the interestingly shimmery metallic finish that was rippled with orange and yellow The standout pieces were the most straightforward the contra-color popper-pocket shorts and skirts were supercute as were the raw cut fabric-lined leather bombers Depending on what you wear under it the transparent hooded mini trench could look pretty good too And that solar flareeffect leather in a little ripcord hoodie would make fine music festival outerwear This collection is a rather literal exercise in brand extension truebut it contains some attractive and wearable pieces that could serve as usefully in a summer wardrobe as a Le Pliage does in your hand$$We exist on the digital frontier at the dawn of a virtual age in which all experience will be filtered through screens Nicolas Ghesquire long one of fashions most intrepid designers isnt looking back Since he arrived at Louis Vuitton in early 2014 the idea of travel has propelled him Vuitton has been in the business of making luggage since 1854 after all But this season he took a different kind of journey We are all living with this new dimension he said afterward We are all managing how to integrate these new notions of digital virtual and cyber with our real life A conversation between technology and nature animated the new collection his most audacious yet for the house and one that had his fans chiming The old Nicolas is back The old Nicolas was a sci-fi obsessive and an experimentalist qualities he subsumed early on during his tenure at LV that came rocketing to the fore here His reference points were many Wong Kar Wais 2046 and the anime series Evangelion came up backstage The show itself started with an introduction to the video game Minecraft which will be familiar to anyone with young children Later a sound clip from Tron Legacy the original of which was a favorite movie from Ghesquires own childhood played I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer Jeff Bridges intoned What did they look like Ships Motorcycles Were the circuits like freeways I kept dreaming of a world I thought Id never see and then one day    I got in  Ghesquires cyberpunks wore moto jackets and metal-embroidered skirts laser-cut leathers and beaded knits that coded like armor and spaceship-print pants Leather gauntlets keyed a tough aggressive attitude but the designers vision was not a dystopic one On the contrary He was quick to point out that his materials looked high-tech but were actually not synthetics at all What with the nailhead-embroidered peasant dresses the crafty sweaters and the festival-girl crop tops and shorts Vuitton Spring looked a lot like a digital bohemia$$Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema meets Marisa Berenson As far as inspiration goes thats a daring match But for Luisa Beccaria it was a successful one at least in the garden where the action for her Spring collection took place It was a quite literal celebration of flower poweror an homage to a horticultural obsession Billowy dresses bloomed with a lavish abundance of lilacs roses carnations irises hydrangeas tulips violets cornflowers periwinkles cyclamens Printed or embroidered in exquisite appliqus they called to mind From Marie Antoinette's Garden a recently published tome that praised the encyclopedic love that the French queen had for all the flowery specimens she tried to grow at the Petit Trianon her pastoral retreat Ever the romantic Beccaria indulged her passion for long ethereal gowns in wispy organza lace and chiffon They had a prairie-chic spirit spiced up with a hint of folklore Seventies bohemian silhouettes added a fresh spin to an ultrafeminine lineup of Empire-waisted frothy dresses with bouffant sleeves and coquette dcolletages Wide-brimmed straw hats and languid floral scarves completed the bucolic look The crowd of posh mothers and daughters part of Beccarias loyal family-and-friends audience looked very pleased ready to order dresses that would be perfect for weddings in historical Tuscan villas or tea parties in manicured gardens$$To hear Lutz Huelle speak about his clothes is to be on the receiving end of all sorts of mini revelations To wit I like that something appears sexy because the person inside it decides it is going to be sexy The supporting evidence a trench coat or gray jersey tunic that could be unzipped from the shoulder down the arm Or else hell consider how a garment might exist in a fixed seductive state of sliding off the body this he did by suspending the core of black parka from diamant straps flipping its raison dtre from outerwear to evening attire Huelle operates from the premise that his designs need to end up being worn otherwise as he puts it Whats the point But his application of elasticized seaming to alter volumes or the flapper fringing spilling forth from a boxy blazer also backed up his belief in eccentric simplicity There were other indications throughout the Spring collection that this under-the-radar Paris-based designer studies construction without overthinking it A dress pleated from neckline to hemline was bookended with circular denim sleeves the result was slouchy yet flattering If the pliant meshakin to citrus-fruit nettingseemed less essential than other pieces it also layered the looks with unexpected edge Speaking of unexpected Huelle arrived at his final looks by accident upon realizing that the sheer perimeter of an embroidered sample made for a dynamic overleaf He loved the idea so much that he tacked an oversize square of black silk onto the front of a white T-shirt dress How easy how right$$In the age of diffusion lines and fast-fashion collaborations where designers are brands and celebrities in their own right Lyn Devon is a breath of fresh air Despite having been in business for 10 years (an accomplishment in and of itself) and enjoying a loyal customer base Devon is far from a household name And thats just fine She prefers to stay small focusing on longtime private clients whom she often hosts in her atelier housed in a cozy Upper East Side town house It suits me she said during an appointment I like having a mom-and-pop vibe Devons design aestheticwhich she describes as elegant put-together clothes her clients who tend to fall between the ages of 35 and 65 can throw on and then forget aboutis as quietly powerful as her business strategy This season she took inspiration from origami and traditional Japanese dress to surprising if subtle effect Paper-thin dresses and tunics were hand-painted by Japanese artist Ken-Ichi Takahashi with botanical and pastoral scenes and the designer introduced a gorgeous pleated hakama pant in khaki and dusty pink Most items in the collection were unlined to emphasize a certain weightlessness and ease of dress For Spring Devon said she thought the idea of tying yourself in felt romantic and so several of her dresses and coats came with a long ropelike belt that could be left off or wrapped around the waist It gives the wearer some autonomy she noted A washed silk coatsomewhere between a robe and a trenchwas a prime example of Devons sweet spot the kind of effortlessly chic piece women on either end of her core age spectrum will fall in love with$$The unrelenting pace of fashion can make it feel a bit like a circus so why not channel that into a collection inspired by trapeze artists tightrope walkers and other high-flying acts M Missoni is one of the few brands that would go for such playful inspiration its signatures include Lurex unexpected color combinations and ribbed knitswhich taken together can lend itself to circus iconography Plus M loves a theme Last season it was all about Texas while other past references have ranged from Shanghai to Little Red Riding Hood done with a wink and plenty of sparkle every time Some of this seasons updates were bold and exaggerated like high ruffled collars (evoking Pierrot clown costumes) lion prints and graphic swirling shapes inspired by big-top tents Elsewhere the whimsical theme was a bit more subduedsee the rainbow-striped jumpsuit bow tie details and color-blocked macram skirt For those who cant quite get behind the ringmaster connotations though you cant beat M Missonis classic knits Clingy sweater dresses and ribbed wide-leg pants in shades of lime fuchsia and lavender would make familiar yet fresh wardrobe additionsespecially if you buy the star-printed sneakers to match$$For Marcia Patmos everything always goes back to travel The ability to seamlessly unpack ones life in a different place is a central concept of the brand Her past collections have referenced far-flung locales like Uzbekistan and Japan but this season Patmos trained her eye a little closer to home drawing upon summer nights spent in the Hamptons and Montauk Imagining the kind of thing youd want to pull on as the air grows cooler at the beach Patmos created an array of cozy transitional pieces like a chunky cardigan scarf worn around the shoulders with two deep pockets and a poncho-like contraption that read as a dress and could be worn over a bathing suit or a full outfit Patmos is not a girly girl but she wanted to incorporate ruffles into the collection partially because she had let her imagination stray slightly to Cuba She did so in the least twee way possible on a slouchy gray cardigan and the sleeves of a white T-shirt She also made a good case for knitwear for eveningan open-knit metallic tank with a fringed hem was a standout Its the kind of thing that will work even if the only island you inhabit next summer is Manhattan$$Why mess with success Under the direction of Somsack Sikhounmuong Madewell has proven itself to be JCrews most solid bet in the face of financial troubles With the designer shifted over to improve the fortunes of the big sister brand this summer new Madewell creative director Joyce Lee has stayed his winning course in her first outing for the label (a Madewell vet of seven years she worked closely with Sikhounmuong before his decampment to JCrew) It was a little sweeter perhaps but whats arguably most remarkable about Madewell is its knack for conjuring up a convincingly familiar quality in spanking-new mass-market clothing Plenty of the styles here looked as if they had seen a road trip or two or at the very least were ready-made for making memories in Consider unexpected vintage touches like custom embroidery (Springs high-waisted flares plus cheeky cherry-red script is a combo that will be hard to beat) or the cosmic cowboyesque stitching on the back of a fatigue jacket All that 70s-hued bohemia found a foil in girlish pieces such as striped rompers and frocks edged in broderie anglaise But perhaps most charming (and savvy) of all was Lees choice to introduce collaborative styles including price-friendly patchworked jeans in partnership with insider-y favorite B-Sides$$You can take the Kitsun girl out of Parisdrop her down in Tokyo Hong Kong or Manhattan saybut you cant take Paris out of the Kitsun girl The Spring images suggest she has ended up in some sort of Dadaist dream a desert locale care of Pierpaolo Ferrari where mountains of gold foil rise from the sand and red doors lead to nowhere In Look 9 in which she is eclipsed by a pair of enormous lips the grid-printed dress-parka combo reads unquestionably Kitsun Ditto the floral-brocade bandeau and high-waisted shorts The womenswear is reliably gamine that way A jersey Teddy jacket and pochette bearing familiar block lettering are true to character the mini empire of Maison Kitsun has risen off the backs (and fronts) of those eager to sport sweatshirts that spread the word But the generously proportioned dress midi skirt and white suit in Looks 6 18 and 20 respectively are evidence that the brand understands it must grow up if it is to grow out If eternally youthful cocreator Gildas Loac speaks as confidently about the overall directionincluding international customers and store expansionsas he does fabrications he can also cherry-pick pieces that show off how far Maison Kitsuns clothes have come Mixed-knit gauges and sweatshirts shaved down to create a mesh-like pattern for example represent ideas that will continue to be developed Desert theme or not the collarless utility jacket in slubbed cotton Japanese indigo leisurewear and patterned tie-front sundresses are instantly likable items that refresh a wardrobe without going to extremes$$A girl in a giant green beehive with silver petalpainted eyes wearing a 50s three-quarter-sleeved clutch coat and a pair of pointy white pumps with bulbous molded heels and toting a capacious white bag was the opener She marked the takeoff point for John Gallianos most rounded and product-filled Maison Margiela collection so far Lo-fi sci-fi was his tagline for it words that came via email rather than straight from the designers mouth as he doesnt appear at the end of his shows nowone of Margielas house traditions he surely values But this was a wholly Galliano trip not an old-school Margiela one He made a delightful merge of vintage-y eccentricity Japanese geisha styling and colorthemes that have constantly been part of Gallianos design territory from the beginning of course The good news was that despite the extreme teased updos and his casting of several androgynous boys to wear dresses this was not one of his excursions into a fantasia of old He had grounded it in a slew of believably wearable clothes for the first time since he arrived at Margiela At one end of the spectrum there was crystal embroidery resembling dangly earrings smothering a mint green 50s coat at the other a pragmatic tailored grass green suit with skinny trousers and a body jacket In between plenty of skirts that might make us think differently about narrow just-above-the-ankle proportions maybe worn with fitted peplumed tops And then for evening and events numerous dresses in extraordinarily subtle combinations of kimono-inspired prints and tintsas well as a glimpse of a gold satin bias-cut slip dress of the kind the designer brought into fashion in the 90s Galliano is back on his game againa relief for those who supported him in the first place and a thrill for another generation whove grown up to see him through new eyes$$Imagine you could temporarily step away from your life and escape to some far-flung corner of the world where a lover awaits what would you want to wear Rabih Kayrouz offered this as the narrative for a wholly desirable lineup that did not require a backstory to leave a lingering impression He bookended the collection with two very different dresses in the same papery ribbed white organza To start a generous caftan punctuated with placket and side pockets just barely tacked down to finish a floor-grazing gown free of finery In between were traces of tailoring that imbued the looks with assured grace from a jumpsuit that folded and flushed around the body to smoking jackets furnished with a fluted overlay offering hands a place to hide  The seductive touches were just as tacit slender slits extended arm openings that converged at the waist or a double set of dress straps framing the dcolletage Similarly the djellaba-inspired robes and fluid draping transmitted the weightlessness of a consummated love affairthe frisson of the body at its freest Suddenly theres nothing to restrict said Kayrouz backstage Its very pure this time Arguably it was also expressivea motif of rainbow ribbons projected pure optimism while a green hue that evoked antique banker lamps suggested his muse wasnt all that concerned about staying inconspicuous The fact that the collection unfurled to the soulful songs of Millie Jackson struck a chord in the absence of the actual escape these clothes were channeling the longing They almost made the heart achein a good way$$Resort was Declan Kearneys first outing as the new creative director of Maiyet It was a breakthrough moment for the brand A veteran of Alexander Wang and Jason Wu Kearney injected Maiyet with a fresh vitality turning out clothes with a high desirability factor The pea coat in particular made the top of a few editors wish lists but there were plenty of other great pieces to wear too Today marked Kearneys debut runway show as well as Maiyets first in New York after a few years in Paris and retailer turnout was high  The brainchild of Kristy Caylor Paul Van Zyl and Daniel Lubetzky Maiyet is an American-born company with a global perspective one that enlists artisans from around the world to weave silk or do beadwork and reinvests in the artisans communities Its a noble mission The thing is women shop with their heart not their conscience Kearneys Resort clothes appealed to both He aimed high for Spring Amelia Earhart and NASAs unsung mathematician Katherine Johnson gave the collection a utilitarian backbone Arizonas Antelope Canyon inspired the striated swoosh motif that appeared on a few loose shifts Knits were a highlight especially a chunky ribbed T-shirt dress that was accessorized by a Bolivian macram scarf and a tunic-length plaid knit sweater worn over a hammered silk slip dress one of the shows dominant silhouettes The burnout velvet numbers at the end were luminous But overall the collection suffered a bit for its washed-out palette and felt a bit flat If Kearney failed to raise pulses quite as high as he did with his first effort he has the time and more importantly the talent to raise the bar$$Eh whats the point That in a nutshell was the thought galvanizing Maki Ohs latest collection Lagos-based designer Amaka Osakwe likes to draw on unexpected themes but a tribute to human futility may be her most far-fetched yet Osakwe was thinking about Sisyphus she said and Camuss quote Our life is built on the hope for tomorrow yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and the Yoruban trick among parents of sending their bored kids around to nearby homes in search of arodan a thing that doesnt actually exist The Almodvar film Talk to Her and the karuwai courtesans of northern Nigeria were bouncing around Osakwes headspace as well making for a rich brew Which in the end was the point Life may be futile Osakwes collection posited but it is also deliciously full Osakwes engagement with existential absurdism freed her up There was a new sense of looseness in the silhouettes witnessed particularly in Osakwes terrific fluid trousers and a refreshing playfulness found in the collections rather daffy approach to embellishment and print Scalloped edges thread embroidery a dash of distressed denim graphic appliqu feathers fringe Lurex meshOsakwe had at it coercing coherence from the mix with her innate sense of discipline She gave herself permission to experiment in other words but the overall effect was far from slapdash And a few of her flourishes had a philosophical weight one doesnt often discover in clothes Note for instance the indigo teardrop print which when you peered inside the tears revealed an underprint of delicate flowers Osakwe is a designer with an urgent need for her clothes to mean something this time out she encompassed that meaning in looks that were her most wearable yet Why wear a relaxed ruffled dress of geometric black broderie anglaise Why not Life is short We take our pleasures where we find them$$Backstage before his show Manish Arora introduced Bunnyla a floppy-eared fashionista who would be making several appearances on the catwalk in some cases enrobed just like her model chaperones The designer then revealed Bunnylas belly ring and the condoms tucked into her bejeweled briefs For writers accustomed to finding young women in a state of undress the sight of Arora enthusiastically lifting a stuffed toys skirt might have been a first But he did this by way of explaining how the Spring collection marked a departure into adult territory Why be pigeonholed into couture tracksuits for raver girls when he could stretch his wings with glamorous gypsy dresses for disco queens Most noticeably Arora swapped the moon boots for metallic platforms by Terry de Havilland and kept his lineup light on pants (the handful of mens looks notwithstanding) In turn he went extra-heavy on full skirts in highlighter hues shoulder- and midriff-bearing tops trimmed with laser-cut filmy fringes and minidresses exploding with plastic flowers  When asked why he pushed into a more feminine arguably costumey register at exactly the moment that people are gravitating toward sport clothes Arora joked How much more could I do adding that he wasnt so much concerned about his customers maturing as elevating his psychedelic aesthetic to a new level of luxe But by now youd think he might realize how easy it is to overdose and past a certain point in the show the groovy folkloric buzz wore off Luckily he was saved by veteran model Debra Shaw who brought a welcome dash of diva to his decadence Bunnyla meanwhile will be multiplied many times over for retail$$Mara Hoffman isnt afraid to take her inspirations literally Willie Nelson was the starting point for her Spring collection and you could sense it from the first look Nelsons beloved song Blue Skies was playing and the set was decorated with a bright sky backdrop that mirrored the models own sky-print suit The girls even sported Nelsons signature waist-length braids in case you didnt pick up on the reference But the musician has a very particular take on Americana which presented a new challenge for Hoffman whose print-heavy collections are known for being exotic She updated Levi's by embroidering them with cornstalks and experimented with classic shirting silhouettes but she also made a point of casting diverse models to represent Americas rich blend of cultures What really felt new for Hoffman though were the tomboy looks Slouchy overalls boxy suits with bolo ties and button-down shirts with popped collars were some of the most masculine clothes shes done but she was drawing from her own personal style My collections are really feminine but more often than not Im in vintage jeans and a shirt buttoned all the way up she said Of course that can be really sexy Even Hoffmans most covered-up propositions like the closing looka sheer star-embroidered shirtdress layered over matching wide-leg pantsfelt alluring in an unexpected way$$New York Fashion Week began and ended with giant spectacles Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy show was contemplative or at least set out to be Marc Jacobss tonight was a clamorous exuberant affair Both got the public involved Its still hard to score access but the shows are less and less an insular insiders-only experience  Circumstance forced Jacobs out of his usual venuesometimes the Army needs the Lexington Avenue Armory He said he jumped at the chance to show in the Ziegfeldas a native New Yorker he grew up seeing movies at the famous theaterand that the innovative setup was custom-fit to the special location Marc Jacobs One Night Only blazed the marquee Inside there was popcorn and fountain drinks cigarette girls offered candy and ushers dispensed Playbills (not a mixed metaphor the original Ziegfeld showed musicals not movies) as they led celebrities like Bette Midler Winona Ryder Sandra Bernhard and Sofia Coppola to their seats Outside models including Bella Hadid Guinevere van Seenus Emily Ratajkowski and the singer Beth Ditto walked the length of a red carpet that stretched for half a block stopping for a picture at the Marc Jacobs step-and-repeat before they made their way up the stairs and into the theater where we watched the street-side happenings on the Ziegfelds giant screen  The show was a love letter to the movies Americas greatest invention to America itself and to a New York City thats all but vanished The Ziegfeld is the largest surviving single-screen theater in Manhattan and trumpeter Brian Newman and his band played punk progenitors the New York Dollss 1973 song Trash Nostalgia is the most powerful force in Jacobss work This season he indulged his insatiable catholic tendencies High culture (Maria Callas as Medea) low (showgirls) and things in between (Janet Leigh in Psycho) mingled on the runway You couldnt help but think that Andy Warhol would have appreciated it not least of all because some of the prints were suggestive of the Pop artists silkscreens  Its the kind of collection that will reward an up-close lookdense with detail and hidden meanings and totally irresistible$$The entertainment multi-hyphenate Marcelo Burlon naturally didnt opt for a static presentation to showcase his burgeoning brand County of Milan Having sprouted from a T-shirt line into a label stocked in hundreds of global stores his womenswear now includes leather outerwear Italian embroidery and allover printed tailoring And for Spring the show producer events planner musician artist and social media magnet channeled his disparate skills into the evenings artistic pursuita dance performance choreographed by Kirikoo Des His tribe of dancers (which included a voguing champion from the House of Ninja and a French Lido dancer) were clad in County of Milan garb and writhed to a soundtrack composed by Burlon and Davide Squillace It was an arresting sight especially in a darkened theater one the Argentine creative director said he used to frequent when he dreamed of becoming a dancer The collections motifseagles snakes and graphics taken from a Lamborghini and Burlon collaboration moved to the beat with a 3-D projection playing in the foreground It was at times awkward when some of the dancers yelled out but still such a welcome change from the usual show format Also unusual Despite the fact that the Milan designer has captured an Instagram following and the fact that many well-known photographers were in attendance few showgoers were unable to take their eyes off the choreography and the clothes Applause instead of phone photography at a runway show A rare sight these days indeed Afterward flicking through his lookbook Burlon said he specifically chose to incorporate the poncho into his Spring collection While elsewhere it may be considered a winter garment in his native country the blanket-like cloak is used to fend off the sun in gold-embossed silk it is bound to appeal as are his new buyer-friendly denim separates (the line sells at Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue) Motifs such as wings were taken up a notch from allover prints to metallic embroidery on the back of leather jackets silk tops and even slides It was a smart act to follow for the casual crowd$$As any department store shopper can attest the biggest problem with designers lower-priced labels is that many fail to capture the magic you see on the runway of their main line For Marchesa Notte the sister collection of Marchesa that usually isn't the case Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig launched Notte back in 2007 to give their couture customers slightly less-fantastical options for garden parties weddings and other nonred carpet affairs With a more approachable price point to matchdresses range from $800 to $1000Notte has also become a go-to for high school proms Girls who are still dreaming about the bird-inspired Jordan almondcolored fairy-tale gowns that hit the Marchesa runway a few days ago will delight in the fact that Notte pulled inspiration from the same places The big difference was in the silhouettes which were just a bit simpler They lent themselves equally well to Marchesa propers rose gold embroideries petal appliqus and tasteful cutouts An added bonus Most of these dresses were relatively ageless save for a blush A-line minidress with tulle overlay and life-size flower embellishments which would look particularly sweet on younger girls with sneakers or gladiator sandals$$They dont refer to fashions flock for nothing Keren Craig and Georgina Chapman looked to the skies for inspiration for their Spring collection and found it slightly closer to earth in a botanical menagerie of caged birds These were represented by fluffy feathered skirts 3-D embroideries of flora and fauna artfully arched modesty-preserving wings and colorful dcollet accents poking out from the bodice of sleek corsets on red carpetready gowns  Sheer boudoir-inspired evening looks in black and nude Chantilly lace provoked further rumination on the caged bird concept The sweeping ombr-dyed tiered tulle trains in shades of sorbet caused a riot of Instagram snaps among a front row section occupied by a gaggle of Disney Channel starlets eager to scrum for their debut in the larger celebrity ecosystem (On the other end of the spectrum and the runway was Bette Midler to whom a thickly jeweled sheer-shouldered gown in deep navy was of significantly more interest) And what else is Marchesa for if not exquisitely rendered red carpet moments for ones own inner Disney princess That a few of the dresses left some runway detritus (a fistful of feathers here petals of tulle there)turning a devoted Harvey Weinstein into a quick one-man clean-up crewonly proved that even the brightest peacocks among us have to return to reality now and again And you know what they say about birds of a feather$$Since his earliest days on the Milan runway Marco de Vincenzo has distinguished himself by his use of embellishments He has a fine eye for the way color pattern and texture can highlight and accentuate a womans body Up until now hes taken inspiration when it was obvious at all from his base in Rome but a recent trip to Japan inspired todays exploration of Eastern motifs The red disc of Japans flag appeared on a couple of tops and Mt Fuji featured on one or two others De Vincenzo used silken kimono fabrics for a handful of coats that did a nice job of straddling the day-night divide  Owing to his decorative tendencies De Vincenzos eveningwear has received the lions share of the presss attention Picking up where his Fall collection left off he made a strong effort here to broaden his before-dark offerings A fanciful kind of girl will appreciate the outfit that combined an over-printed silver leather jean jacket a rainbow-striped collared shirt and a lavender pencil skirt in a squiggle motif that was echoed on the metal heels of strappy sandals De Vincenzo was fairly brazen about mismatching patterns here and it totally paid off  It was with some of the eveningwear that he stumbled A wisp of a dress with a single breast in ruffle-swathed optic lace probably shouldnt have made it out of the atelier The underwire detailing on other dresses proved almost as distracting Elsewhere though the tinkering paid off Chiffon shredded like confetti read like fur from a distance in the hand it was almost preternaturally light In a bid for the minimalists in the room De Vincenzo showed midi-length gilets and flared pants in the fabric in monochrome black and white but it was a true marvel on a coat that shaded from black at the shoulders through white red and blue to a deep yellow band at the hem$$No matter what the latest trends are dictating the concept of high-low juxtaposition will always be in style Marissa Webb has built her business around contrasts like masculine and feminine hard and soft edgy and sweet For Spring Webb didnt veer too far from those signatures but her inspiration lent a fresh genuinely new angle After flipping through old 1950s photographs of her grandfather Albert decked out in military fatigues beside her grandmother who favored prim dresses she realized how great those uniforms would look mixed together The result was a collection rich with texture color and volume  Instead of adhering to one specific vibe Webb tends to play with mini themes throughout her collections here there were neon orange lace dresses grungy plaids and a pale pink skinny suit which offered a slicker take on Le Smoking But the best looks featured some kind of vest a plaid-and-lace dress with a leather pinafore-style vest or a swishy floral gown topped with an abbreviated army jacket From a distance the vests and dresses appeared to be fused together for one easy piece but shoppers will be able to buy them separately come next year That kind of styling trick calls to mind Webbs career-defining stint at JCrewarguably the harbinger of the modern mash-up lookbut perhaps well see more of those mixed references at her Banana Republic presentation this Saturday$$As fashion formulas go heaping playful decorative motifs onto a template of featherlight streetwear seems promising And it certainly succeeded for Markus Lupfer who this season presented a confident tight variation of his it-just-works recipe His theme was so out of left field as to seem arbitrary flowers and Mexican wrestlers As he explained it I envisaged this hard desert land Then it starts raining and fields of flowers bloom Chrysanthemum embroideries rustled around illustrations of ham-thighed colorfully masked wrestlers on T-shirts and sweatshirts made of French lace or black organza skirts shorts and bombers Chokers and vulcanized skater shoes were garlanded with more blooms in beads pins and sequins An appliqu wave rippled across more organza while Lupfers strongest traditional evening proposal was a rose-gold flower-heaped fil coupe shift with a layered underskirt Printed drawstring silk-mix track pants shorts and tees meanwhile were the pieces you could imagine buying and wearing straight out of the store Imposing sometimes-borderline OTT decorations onto elevated versions of pieces that so many young women wear every day is a pretty sweet niche and Lupfer has clearly made it his own$$Mentally undressing models is not the usual activity of a fashion reviewer Were here to evaluate clothes not bodies But at Marni the mind couldnt help inquiring What was happening under all those triangular asymmetrical layers The suspicionhope evenwas that it might be a simple anchoring slip as the back views of some of Consuelo Castiglionis looks gave a glimpse of satin and straps From the front the rigid leather and ponyskin camisole-like aprons and tunics of her first outfits seemed a clue that she was presenting an abstracted thought about the key garment of the season Later on the shape reappearedat times as long dresses in oversize sport mesh other times as plain wool structures with geometric chunks cut out of the skirtsand always amongst assemblages of other garments That adds up to a lot to put on all at once Marni is a brand with a woman-friendly reputation for color and print and this collection did have plenty of it Castiglioni proved her eye for the right orange red tobacco brown and bottle green which few designers would dare place in the same collection as egg yolk yellow primary blue and shell pink But it was with her giant leaf prints on graceful elongated tunics over fluid trousers that the collection really hit its stride It was then that the anxious viewer stopped worrying about what it would feel like to manage all those semi-garments and began to appreciate the chic neo-moderne metal and dangly acetate earrings and chunky lacquer bracelets that are such a Marni draw No one will ever want this brand to go minimalist but when Castiglioni shows a little less she makes her customers want her more$$Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida arent abrasive rebellious-seeming people at allif anything they seem pleasantly down-to-earth (Marta) and almost shy (Paulo) But these two apart from being incredibly hard-working are also quietly obstinate about going their own way  From the beginning they took what seemed an extreme path with their super-shredded denim in direct opposition to what some young Londoners call Downing Street fashion (ie the tendency toward a pretty party dress) and kept their sights on doing clothes for real street As Marta Marques often says the benchmark they always use is whether her 22-year-old sister Sofia finds their clothes acceptable and whether normal girls can find the prices within the realms of affordability Well the extent to which that stubborn luxury-resistant policy has paid off can be seen not just in the innumerable Marques  Almeida pieces in evidence on the Fashion Week crowds but also in the influence of this Portuguese couples work has had on mainstream manufacturing If 2015 is the year a pair of ripped-knee jeans made its way into every girls wardrobe thats thanks to Marta and Paulo Which is why the great and the good of the fashion firmaments of many nations battled through torrential rain to a north London warehouse to witness what Marques  Almeida is offering this spring Answer more of the same destroyed-yet-practical glamour for street bar festival and pub Maybe its the combination of the designers Latin genes and their 90s-revering generational taste that made them come up with ruffles (that wave thats rippling across fashion right now) and transparency In their book though the ruffle-fronted shirt has gone wild and raw-edged roughly chopped into dense halter-bibs while the flounces run across sheer chiffon or down into shaggy-fringed denim skirts If at times the deconstructionism got a bit too skimpy things took a turn for the far more interesting when the couple started taking on new fabricsslubby-beige linen and burlapand working in a crackly-surfaced patent leather and chocolate brown suede There was a traily grunge-by-way-of-Galliano feeling and a tinge of 90s romanticism going on as well butrememberthese designers are not the kind of people who spend their nights partaking of any louche party scene As realists they are carefully deepening their brand by simply reproducing their most-liked shapes (jeans oversize biker jackets halters) in different fabrics Clever$$Post-show Martin Grants supporters congratulated him on what they felt was his best collection yet Not that they were wrong but it prompts the question based on what Heres one theory It felt thoughtfully composed Grant picked up where his pre-collection left off by reintroducing the linen-wool blend that he uses in place of denim as well as the silk organza feathery tinsel aka his summer fur And once again he barely left the confines of black warm white and navy The printsa paint splotch and a medley of stripeswere created by hand and counterbalanced the rough-hewn silk and double-face cotton with rhythmic lift Theres a chance that Grants women offered such unanimous praise because he left out the pieces that in previous seasons existed to attract younger customers to the label Instead he seems to have realized that neckline emphasis is good waistline emphasis is better and slimming emphasis is best of allno matter the age Furthermore the eveningwear optionsfrom chemise and ball skirt to elongating jumpsuitoozed urbane chic Ultimately Grant doesnt leave a writer with much to reportno theme inspiration muse or talking pointswhich might give the false impression that the collection was light on ideas Was it his best Perhaps only Grant is equipped to judge But judging against his recent endeavors it was right up there$$It is weirda sort of barely conceivable telescoping of timeto realize that Mary Katrantzou graduated from Central Saint Martins MA in 2008 with precisely 10 shift dresses each of them digitally printed with oversize images of jewelry (the evidence is in the archives of Vogue Runway) Well look at her now seven years on filling the atrium on the Central Saint Martins campus with a large immensely intricate body of work framed around Roma gypsy dress and cosmic stargazingall of it visible in a vast mirror that reflected the lineup into infinity The G-forces exerted on any designer whose business has taken off so rapidlyKatrantzou sells around the world noware extreme But the remarkable thing about her is how she has adapted over that time always carefully paying attention to critical feedback as she speeds forward After breaking new territory with digital trompe loeil prints which all too swiftly became a widespread style throughout the fashion world she turned away from her computer and went into handcrafted embellishment When people criticized her for being a decorator she moved on to experimenting with sculpted shape And when the response to that hinted that her experiments might be getting too cumbersome she came back with what she presented tonight a collection that combined tiny flower prints micro sequins and metallic quilting in weightlessly fluttery forms It is interestingmaybe even disturbingto wonder why so many designers in Europe have been thinking about the folkloric costume traditions of the peoples of the Balkans Romania Hungary and farther east Can it be that the consciousness of mass migrations in the daily news is ending up processed into floral prints and collaged patchworks on pretty fashionable dresses If so then Katrantzou is not the only designer or label that has become porous to those subconscious influences Mini-rose prints on a black background even turned up on the Topshop runway four hours before Katrantzous show and before that in many variations in the British designer Stuart Veverss Coach collection in New York City last week But Katrantzou in her intelligent way senses the danger of being boxed into a trend In this outing she also showed she can take on the challenge of proving shes able to design without print without color and without embroidery or texture Her passage of pieces involving solid black material cut with couture-like exactitude into A-line skirts and fit-and-flare coat silhouettes was surprising yet instantly desirable Compared with the clothes she was making when she came out of CSM this collection bore almost no relation stylistically The only link between the two is lodged in Katrantzous constantly self-challenging brain And the intellectual result whatever it might be elevated this season to another plane$$Summer may feel like a distant memory now obscured by the fracas of fashion month but the season came to vivid life in Maryam Nassir Zadehs latest offering The designer imagined it as a series of distinct personal chapters The first was bright open and inspirational colored by the time she spent traveling with her family in Italy a heady vision of days in Palermo Rome Puglia and Capri But vacations always enda second chapter told the story of returning to New Yorks harsher often tumultuous realities Zadehs denouement lands somewhere in the middle grounded in a life at home and informed by the perspective of time abroad  The designers Spring lineup was an organic expression of those ideas not too beholden to plot There is a certain intimacy that seems to mark Zadehs clothestheyre both familiar and uncanny Take the gentle volume of a sculptural metallic organza bomber or crisp poplin dresses which came unexpectedly tied halterlike at the neck Ensembles were alternate strokes retro-beachy and rustic likewise in palette pops of lime and cherry red drew a sharp contrast to shades of blush and gold that recalled the gessoed walls of Zadehs summer travelsa lovely dissonance  Still for many MNZ shoppers the biggest news here will be the exciting trials in reworked denim A pair of pants patchworked in varying washes from cornflower on up to indigo will be a sure sellout ditto a softly fraying jacket made from a pair of jeans$$Nautical has been in style in summer at least since Coco Chanel set sail around the Mediterranean with her lover the Duke of Westminster in the 20sand even she cant claim to have invented it since earlier examples of sailor collars and boaters go back to Edwardian times Why else would we automatically call a certain shade of dark blue navy So for a purveyor of classics such as Max Mara the theme is a natural and obvious one And theres nothing wrong with obvious Faced with the oceans of mucked-about and difficult clothes that are proffered as fashion how astonishingly nice would it be to know there was one store where perfectly cut sailor pants striped Breton T-shirts and jerseys peacoats and the like are reliably available Max Maras creative director Ian Griffiths should not fear that this could be a boring missionthe fact is that non-bonkers non-branded classics can actually also be synonymous with cool In his presentation there were plenty of garments that might fall under the classification of great genericsthe sort of clothes that could live with you for years He threw in a couple of novelty notesthe star-pattern knits (no doubt inspired by officers epaulets) and prints of ropes on silk piecesand he couldnt hold back on some quirky styling extending the sleeves of stripy tees and doing up jackets and coats on the wrong button  la 80s John Galliano As a matter of fact Griffiths really doesnt need to try to dress up Max Maras classics in that sort of way at all One day he should see what happens if the company simply marches out 30 variations of a single garmentfar from narrowing his audience he might just convince the young as well as the middle-aged and senior among us After all the democracy of chic has no age limit$$One thing you may not have known until now Sarah Burton in addition to her role as creative director of Alexander McQueen is also in charge of McQ the labels contemporary line McQ was brought back from the licensing world five years ago and has steadily smoothened and shaped itself as McQueens sportier complement with an underlying war cry of corrupting the everyday With a focus on New York in the late 70s to the mid-80sthe no wave art movement especiallyBurton and her team came up with a collection that was both kitschy and hard invigorated by graphic elements like polka dots silvery metallic leathers (even in dress form) and chain accents As for the latter Burton suggests wearing them as suspenders belts or necklaces or all at the same time and layering them with abandoneven over something as lo-fi as an outsize white T-shirt and an ivory-hued skirt The strongest pieces here were the polka-dot numbers namely so in the form of a silk georgette long-sleeved floor-scraping dress punked out with yet another chain Likewise with rose lace options these all held a touch of the macabre romanticism that Burton has woven into McQueen proper It would be nice actually to see more of this element as McQ continues to develop$$New Yorkbased Melitta Baumeister considered scrawling legible writingcatchphrases evenacross her glossy vinyl bonded garments before settling on black spray-paint tagging and white chalk paint I like the illegal aspectthat something beautiful can be defaced and appear destroyed she said from a rental apartment in the east stretch of Paris Surface patterning no matter how unruly marks new territory for the young designer who has become best known for using slick stiff and spongy materials that arent traditionally wearable On that count shes progressed too For Spring Baumeister used second-skin viscose Lycra to offset her exaggerated volumes But lest this sound like shes conceding to retail imperatives the details were as fetishist as everthe bodysuits zippers ran from nape of neck all the way around to the front of the crotch And she figured out how to affix nipple ringtype hardware to a top (and elsewhere to coat closures) so that people can experience the shock value sans pain or permanence Simply by keeping strict about her silhouettes (hey its all relative) Baumeister is showing maturity But for all the checks there remain a few imbalances The back of a padded apron dress consisted only of a harness Add a pair of pants or skirt and the front becomes maternity wear In a perfect world Baumeister would prefer her looks be worn in full an admission thats equal parts understandable and unrealistic In February one or two of them will be featured in BeautyCooper Hewitt Design Triennial  Her work will fit right into an exhibition setting But its clear that fitting in has never been her goal$$At Michael Kors Collection Spring 2016 had a curious but possibly telling dichotomy running through itminimal androgyny in neutrals on the one hand and flowery womanliness in pretty colors on the other In a way it looked as if two collections had been chopped up and merged together so that to quote from the show notes you had for example Lisa wearing Look 13 white linen gauze duster white tissue linen tank white linen gauze utility pant followed by Lindsey in Look 14 a lapis poppy-print georgette dress with frayed floral embroidery Michael Kors is one of the great American storytellers of New York fashion and it scarcely needs to be reiterated that his narrative about a serene discreetly moneyed and always optimistic lifestyle is enthusiastically (and lucratively) received far beyond the United States Would those followers be puzzled by the two strands running through this show Unlikely for both come from the traditional American playbookstripped-down-90s utilitarian go-to-work tailoring and decorative dresses for entertaining and special occasions In other words this was a collection that covered the social waterfront with everything from Korss classic tan suede trenches and billowy poet-sleeved blouses with drawstring necklines to an evening shirtdress with vertically inserted strips of sheer Chantilly lace all of which looked good But perhaps the underlying contrasts between those two aesthetics is also an unconscious reflection of two rival themes that have emerged this week at the New York showsthe celebration of cleaned-up grunge-era style which is everywhere and the newer backlash toward sophisticated pulled-together feminine dressing weve seen from Peter Copping at Oscar de la Renta As it happens with his poppy prints and fil coupe fabrics Kors was on almost exactly the same page as Copping so no matter how his customer feels like playing it come next season Kors has her covered$$A return to nature is already a big theme for Spring 16 but Millys Michelle Smith was perhaps the least likely designer to go there Over the past few years her collections have been all about sporty fabrics graphic colors and structured silhouettes so Spring was almost free-spirited in comparison Smith said she wanted to capture the ephemeral feeling of a summer romance but not in a clich way (read no billowing chiffon or girly florals) Instead she relied on texture to give familiar minimal garments a new sense of ease  Denim linen felt particularly fresh for Milly A strapless no-frills gown would be just as chic with flat mules or strappy stilettos and thats exactly the kind of versatility women are looking for these days Asymmetrical skirts in fluttery silk cady also fit the day-to-night bill as did a range of crispy poplin shirts and dresses When you really stopped to think about it though this collection was more about an attitude than anything else Sure you could see a beach sunset in the rich papaya-and-gold jacquard pieces and plunging necklines exposed a sensual flash of skin But it was also interesting to see the way Smith layered a miniskirt over an extra-long shirtdress or how a bias-cut slip dress floated around the body just so Its those quieter details that added up to the chicest real-life looksthey left room for interpretation  Backstage before the show Smith said it all felt like entirely new territory for her But what designer doesnt love a challenge With sport references on the sharp decline this looked like a promising new direction for Milly$$Mira Mikati set the bar high at her debut last season thanks in part to a cameo collaboration with artist Darcel Disappoints (Craig Redman) For her follow-up she recruited Kaws (Brian Donnelly) The three special-edition multicolored varsity jackets they did together favor Mikatis buoyant vibe more than the grayscale angst of Kawss Companion character Zoom out to the full collection and theres no escaping the fact that fun is her driving forceand for Spring a fantasy road trip across America At a presentation space filled with cactus balloons and bold city signage she showed off how workmanship and a personalized touch elevated her ideas beyond the realm of camp Do not disturb me appeared laser cut and outlined in embroidery on the back of a cotton linen car coat rather than simply printed A comic cityscape pattern inspired by a coloring book featured crayon contributions from her children  If drawing from Santa Fe and New York in equal measure risks a disparate representation of styling souvenirs (from bohemian suede and a crochet poncho to a shrunken blazer and sleeveless trench) the predominance of whiteright down to the sneakersbalanced all of the layering like a gallery backdrop Indeed the progression of the narrativefrom Wake up for Fall to Sleep all day for Springsuggests an outward expression of Mikatis inner dialogue But as much as the text sounds refreshingly unfiltered design is a creative exercise in filtering and to her credit she creates clothes not wearable art Of course at the rate shes going she might just convince the likes of Murakami or Space Invader to join in on the fun Shes certainly sparked the desire to collect$$For Spring 2016 Misha Nonoo presented a series of eminently wearable tomboyish coveralls flirty A-line skirts and culottes in all shades of rusty poppy and chalk white denim and breezy and bright pajama-style suiting There were baby blue cropped T-shirts embroidered with in-jokes (Darling Naughty Square So Real Surreal) breezy white summer separates and swinging bell-sleeved knit frocks and all took inspiration from no less than the Bauhaus movement minimalism by way of Donald Judd and what Nonoo called a 1960s 1970s cool girl vibe  Honestly everyone does the same thing in our industry so how do you stand out asked Nonoo who chose to opt out of the New York show schedule and instead debut her designs in a one-two wallop of a freshly created Instagram account as well as on the backs of a bevy of handpicked fashion influencers from Lena Dunham and Olivia Palermo to New York City Ballet principal dancer Sara Mearns and Linda Rodin who will post selfies in ensembles from the collection on their own accounts today When you have most of your front row built out of people with huge social media followings and what you really want is for them to go to your show take a picture and share it with their followers why dont you just get to that point first asked Nonoo who shot her parochial schoolinspired box-pleat pinafores graph-paper-checked shirtdresses and grosgrain-trimmed jacquard sundresses at Pioneer Works in Red Hook Brooklyn orienting the results to a horizontal wallpaper-style scroll (users will be directed to flip their iPhones) for the new account and who estimates that the cumulative followers of her international band of influencers total somewhere around 8 million (And without a single seating chart) The thought Nonoo explained is that rather than have everyone come to her shell go to where the action isin the steady grips and handbags of fashion editors fans and her customers Ultimately its all about the asset in the first place so if you can create even better assets even more stylized assets said Nonoo then why not just do that Its worth noting that she has recently found success going her own way with the December launch of an in-house e-commerce site proving both fruitful and educational insofar as connecting with the Misha Nonoo customer Things are changing the designer explained doing this beautiful very art-directed shoot in a space that I love that I feel super-comfortable in for me its showing more about my brand and my collection and the environment and the ethos and the philosophy than 15 minutes on a runway Only time will tell if her followers earn that designationbut its a heck of a start$$Turns out you really can go home again For Spring 2016 Angela Missoni took her brand back to its roots Sportswear exclaimed the designer backstage before the show Her boards were full of photographs of Maasai tribespeople (Africa being as Missoni noted the roots of humanity) and the graphic street-centric work of the Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez whose colorful kinetic crosswalks inspired the runway Yet the show was full of the bright breezy vibrant type of jet setready attire that has made the house iconic for decades  The silhouette was long and lean with narrow sweeping cardigans paired with hot pants fete-ready halter-neck dresses in vibrant metallic pleats and open-collared tunics paired with flowing trousers Swimwear boasted generous looping ties or thick layered Maasai-inspired collars Fitted striped polo shirtsthe type of thing Missoni fans have long scoured vintage stores forfelt like a slam dunk Before we were a zigzag we were a stripe said Missoni backstage and for a house with an innately bohemian attitude (and during a season full of splashy occasionally bewildering debuts) you cant get more straightforwardor more comfortingthan that$$Miuccia Prada is interested in the political and the pervy Always has beenbut especially now Todays Miu Miu show had kitschy nylon-looking negligees layered over sweaters and gingham shirts it involved wintry purple and green lozenge-patterned narrow coats and midi pencil skirts fur stoles and boxy Deco-patterned cardigans Anxious that this doesnt make sense Dont be That is exactly Pradas point Though the outrageous glam rockmeets-Kiss multicolored patchwork platform boots are her other point obviously They might as well have had Buy Me Now picked out in the glitter on their heels It all came out in an end-of-season conversation in the dark at the conclusion of the Miu Miu presentationthe show at which the audience is always stir-crazy after looking at clothes for 28 days in four cities and not exactly feeling entirely compos mentis Neither is Prada who talked about how she had to put together both the  mainline Prada collection and Miu Miu in the midst of dealing with the passing of her 103-year-old aunt Nana whom she described as a second mother The designer wasnt at the Prada show so this was the first time she surfaced in public this season Really Miu Miu was about irrationality she began The times we are in are extreme Theres conservatism on both the right and left in politics And then people look for escapes from it attracted to strange religious beliefs or underground clubs and music One of the underground clubs shes thinking of is definitely kinkya sexy salon she quipped laughing as she indicated those see-through negligees which were caught up in quite a few looks As so often was the case this season the assemblages on this runway seemed made to be pulled apart layer by layer and absorbed into a womans wardrobe in whatever manner makes sense to her The ways of high-fashion styling are indeed extreme but surely even the most ambitious blogger wont be daring enough to parade herself in the full Miu Miu rig in front of next seasons street photographers Ladies suffering from dementia may be seen going out shopping thus attired forgetting in which order the nightie goes on but mimicking them in full may be a few steps too far down the road toward kooky delirium for most On the other hand there were the aforementioned boots a major draw in a season of loudly decorative footwork not to mention more conservatively sweet ballet slippers (again with a touch of the confused in their mismatched ribbon ankle ties) tiaras ruffle-neck blousesaSwan Laketutuand within it all goth black-and-white silk pieces printed with candles and cigarette lighters surely a mini collection unto itself Theres a method to Miu Mius madness after all$$Todays gritty MM6 Maison Margiela runway presentation was a flashback to the industrial techno dens of Londons subterranean club scene In a cavernous corner east of the city representatives of the MM6 collective wore anonymous white lab coats The disruptive mood was cemented by the huge bank of analog recording equipmenta wall of sound if you willthat formed the backdrop to this retro-futuristic warehouse party As models took to the stage they stopped to tinker with the equipment as if to create their own soundtrack to what was a hypnotic display These club kids came well prepared for a long nightpacking Coke cans beers and even plastic banana holders in their Perspex cross-body bags (how else to stylishly sustain an all-nighter) MM6 mainlined the chaos and creativity of post-gender club kids beautifully This was an idea-packed show with more than one standout moment There were eagle and equestrian prints glitter-bombed fanny packs retooled as tops and plastic bin liners fashioned into everything from a surprisingly elegant blouson to detachable pouf sleeves and a cerulean sundress Ideas were pulled from not-so-distant eras then reappropriated and repeated There was also a prettiness here (for both boys and girls) in the pink metallic Ziggy Stardust two-pieces and sheer dresses in khaki and pale blue that tied at the neck with pussy bows MM6 surely is a place for its group of designers to have fun mining the dress-up box of recent history But the models with determinedly blank stares and hunched posture resembled androids giving fun a far-off feel$$When you are grown-up its easy to long for the carefree entirely fictional days of youth and forget the reality of dreary schoolbooks and even drearier summer jobs Is it any wonder that as you take your first steps into the adult world you so often arm yourself with powerful fashion fantasies  Molly Goddard in her latest presentation had her real girl models working at a replica of a sandwich factory but they were going about their soul-numbing tasks in clouds of tulle and smocked raw silk ivory frocks Is the designer telling us that this is the way life should be that we must assert our fierce conviction that inside we are all fairy princesses All ballerinasregardless of what life holds for us at the moment Certainly this young designer is striking a chordduring recent Fashion Weeks in London and New York numerous fashion editors (including this author) could be seen squeezing into tiny show seats swathed in billowing Goddard tulle In this latest outing Goddard offered her classic outsize silhouette with a few new embellishmentsa lovely acid green tutu featured hand embroideries tiny pink skirts were awash in burgundy ruffles and there were tartan dresses that seemed like the fantasy version of a school uniform that some little girl who cant wait to grow up is dreaming of$$The program notes described this latest Moncler Gamme Rouge collection as Versailles meets Abstraction which doesnt immediately call to mind luxe sportswear but does suggest something rather rarefied And perhaps this has been the modus operandi of the Gamme Rouge range all alongyet it was never more apparent than today when a mass of maidens ambled up and down a garden path (more enchantingly English than formal French) in looks that married haute couture with high performance After a tender exchange with Lee Radziwill creative director Giambattista Valli explained how a plumped-up slicker in technical lace flounced dresses in embroidered PVC a gray sweatsuit embellished with lilies of the valley and a leotard in red jacquard all expressed varying degrees of the same elite inspirations fencing and French chteaus Indeed when the bar is set this elegant a parka is no longer a parkaits a rococo confection in guipure that happens to be rain resistant Moncler gives me the technical fabrications and the support and I do it in an atelier way Valli noted as Bianca Brandolini dAdda planted a kiss on his cheek The designer conceded that the Spring offering always poses a greater point-of-view challenge than Fall because outerwear isnt the customers priority With this one he plucked more elements from historical dress than usual yet the floral-embroidered sneakers (and sneaker boots) kept the feeling decidedly fresh Though there were quite a few dashing black looks for evening in the mix such a predominantly white collection might send another message to his gilded lilies Said Valli I love the idea that Gamme Rouge is sporty but you can get married in it$$Monique Lhuilliers front row was an apt description of where her brand is headed these days Bella Thorne Ashley Madekwe and nearly a dozen other pretty young things were decked out in the velvet floral dresses and tea-length party frocks that defined the designers latest Fall and Resort collections Considering that youth was one of the themes Lhuillier name-checked at a preview last week those are just the girls who will want to wear Springs super-bold looks on the red carpet Lhuillier has certainly never been afraid of color but in this collection she turned the vibrancy up to the max Bright poppy lipstick pink electric blue and tangerine silk gazar made for sweet sculptural shift dresses as well as more directional looks like an emerald tunic over skinny jacquard flares or a turquoise bustier top with a trailing sash Either of those pant-centric ensembles would be an unexpected choice for say a New York movie premiere or press call Structure was a big message but a parade of feather-light gowns in paint-splatter prints (and minimal embellishment) lent a more ethereal artsier tone The accessories were also hard to miss its still a new category for Lhuillier and here she made the case for matching your shoes to your outfit with jewel-like Lucite wedges and embellished sandals It felt as though she designed them specifically with the red carpet in mind$$Aspiring young designers have two new role models to look up to Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia who presented their first collection for Monse on Saturday afternoon The duo met during stints at Oscar de la Renta where they discovered their own strengthsKim as design studio director Garcia as a top designerwhile learning from a beloved industry legend  For their buzzy debut which saw Prabal Gurung Domenico De Sole and Ruth Wilson sitting front row Kim and Garcia presented an original yet approachable vision We like the idea of relaxed glamour Garcia said before the show A classic shirt was the starting point for everything We realized its something that a lot of people can relate towe just looked at it in a different way The first dress out was a cotton poplin mini that mimicked an oversize shirt wrapped artfully around the shoulders It checked all the right boxes There was texture a fresh silhouette and just a hint of charmall in one youthful and wearable garment It was followed by a billowing maxi dress with a similar wrapped-and-knotted effect Of course the construction likely wasnt as easy as tying a bowbreaking down an item as familiar as the button-down shirt wouldnt work unless the craftsmanship was meticulous and a bit restrained Those white cotton pieces were naturally relaxed but even the grander propositions in silk faille taffeta and duchesse satin felt effortless We wanted it to look like you just buttoned it up and were done Kim said Were inspired by real girls today who wear jeans flats    They want something easy  Its a concept that mirrored de la Rentas own passion for ready-to-wearclothes that make women feel beautiful without being complicated You could sense his influence in the rich jewel tones and luxe fabrics too and in the 3-D cotton flowers and oversize bows Prepare to hear a lot more from Monse in the coming months$$Nobody but nobody is having more fun than Jeremy Scott at Moschino Season by season the ideas get zanier but the productions just keep getting bigger And why not when his clothes and accessories are selling so well True to silly form tonights theme was car-wash couture Traffic cones barricades and a genuine car wash that sprayed bubbles instead of water were installed on the runway No Parking Couture Zone one sign read another Dangerous Couture Ahead Also true to form this was not a show about subtext But if it was all out there on the waxed and polished surface that doesnt mean it wasnt smart Take the full-skirted trench coat with a warning sign on the backOpen Trench it reador the little black dress with the iconic red octagon on the chest printed Shop not Stop In a he-thinks-of-everything moment Scott had none other than Lapo Elkann international playboy and heir to the Fiat automobile fortune in the front row  The accessories served up one visual pun after another None other than Stephen Jones milliner to fashion royals and royal royals did the veiled hard hats and traffic cone chapeaux There were toolbox and lunch-box bags tail-fin sunglasses and caution-tape sandals As for the clothes they were the tony uptown answer to last seasons below-14th-Street streetwear Chanel-style skirt suits came in flashy neons with flashier reflective-tape edging others had Cristbal Balenciagaworthy volumes Scott played fast and loose with Chanel-isms most literally and perhaps dangerously with a print of interlocking C clamps A pair of petticoated satin party dresses with taillights lifted off a 57 Chevy looked like a subtler (if you can call it that) reference to Thierry Muglers iconic corset  An extended evening section that riffed on the rotating brushes of drive-through car washes was capped off by a long column dress with a neon sign slung over one shoulder Scotts got fans just crazy enough to take it for a spin IRL$$There was a quiet confidence this morning at Mother of Pearl Maybe the self-assured mood was helped along by the historic surroundings of the Caf Royal but for her sophomore solo show creative director Amy Powney embraced her pretty pioneer theme with gusto It all started with Victoriana then took a Midwestern turn she said backstage But the real cues came from Laura Wilsons photographs of the Hutterites of Montana a closed community whove farmed the land of the American West since the turn of the century These settlers may eschew the technological trappings of modern life but they sure know their way around a smock dress And as Bon Ivers Holocene was plucked out on the banjo (what else) Powney evoked those prairie pastures with a series of piecrust collar shirts pinafore dresses and pantsuitssome in decorative sequined ginghams and checks and others in botanical prints of her own design It was these trippy patternswhich up close revealed scenes of lobsters carrying combs and narcissistic birds gazing into Alice looking glassesthat were arguably the high point of the collection In line with MOP founder Maia Normans signature sporty vision all this was punctuated by some cleaner sleeker looks The black bonded leather and neoprene coats worn over scholarly mustard-toned tops and track-y pants were supremely wearable But Powney never strayed too far from the frills and the flourisheseven athletic sweatshirts were embellished with ruffles and embroidered roses Add playful footwear to this mixsneaker-soled Mary Janes that were carried through from Resort and pointy-toed 80s bootiesand youve got a collection that is seriously rich in box set inspiration Pull out those copies of Little House on the Prairie and St Elmos Fire now$$Massimo Giorgetti quickly found an audience for his upbeat contemporary brand MSGM launched four years ago Street style types scooped it upits bright colors and loud prints are irresistible to photographersand now the label is found in hundreds of stores across the globe His success landed him the plum assignment of creative director at Emilio Pucci At home at MSGM today he tried something new swapping much of the quirky sweetness of previous seasons for a more tomboyish wannabe badass spirit His notes mentioned Catherine Hardwickes skateboard movie Lords of Dogtown but he couldve just as easily been channeling another subculture turned mass culture like grunge or punk thanks to the shredded plaid separates an oversize hoodie and long knit pants that pooled at the soles of high-top sneaks But Giorgetti didnt fully commit and heavy silver chains wrestled with bows as the shows dominant decorative motif They first dripped from long tunics and laced up the would-be seams of chain-mail tees and skirts (MSGMs full-body collars could make 50 Shades of Greys Anastasia Steele blush) Bows meanwhile adorned waistlines and hips trailing ribbons past the knees Ruffles were supersized too Up until now the magic at MSGM has been in the mix but this season Giorgetti's usual irreverence came off more like indecision$$The ships propeller backdrop and aircraft carrier runway semaphored David Komas theme at Mugler today military What again The frequency with which the uniform of war is press-ganged by designers intent on crafting clothes to love can seem counterintuitive in an industry based on generating innovation Donatella Versace just launched her martial-themed Spring 16 collectiona campaign for gender empowermentwhile Chalayans was a typically dense take inspired by the end of Cubas isolation Every season for either gender you can expect a significant military presence Why Its not complicated When done well military collections can make the utilitarian seem sexy via universally recognizable signifiers Komas casus belli seemed straightforward too Half-hiding behind a mirror to evade well-wishers after this show the designer said We have such incredible girls here and its about being inspired by them Wanting them to look cool to look fresh and to enjoy clothes He rattled through pretty much every military service The first wave was naval an interplay of navy and white with decorative insignia buttons on looks that included an angled peak-lapel three-button double-breasted jacket and minidresses that rearranged the fold and contrast of traditional sailor suits One dress featured a lovely helter-skelter twist of white that twined around the body above a four-button accent Softer items included an asymmetrical-hemmed pliss dress with half-zip details at the waist Next into the field came the army the olive section included a cutaway backless dress in leatherthe top and bottom half linked by a clasp of three gleaming officer stripes Soft kicky trousers were topped with deconstructed bodices while the classic field jacket was turned into a sleeveless minidress with silk poacher pocketsa skinny belt peppered with eyelets cinched the waist A dress decorated with a grid of angular metal openings and dresses crisscrossed with metal-piped slashes were harder to link to Komas theme although the former did demand the wearer go commando She must NOT wear underwear ordered the look-board backstage Komas body-con brigade kept coming some in hefty-heeled pointy-toed monk-strap flats some with the straps of their handbags looped through the epaulets at their shoulder A burst of burnt orange looks ran contrary to the camouflage agenda of real militarywear but had the explosive impact that Muglers customers enjoy The final push was Doutzen Kroes looking invincible in a backless navy jumpsuit This was a deceptively simple but cleverly executed take on military and it won$$The seed for Naeem Khans Spring 2016 collection was first sowed in Mexico where the designer hosted his wifes 60th birthday party The theme of the three-day event was centered around Frida Kahlo and guests were encouraged to come dressed the part flower headdresses and all That idea carried him on a trip to the Mediterranean where his fascination with flowers bloomed Dresses in bougainvillea pink lilac and marigold floated down the runway and some of the most successful looks referenced that influence including a gorgeous lemon floral-beaded caftan gown Khan was also thinking of muses like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren echoes of styles worn by both could be seen in the wasp-waist full-skirted ball gowns A lilac gazar number with rolled bateau neckline particularly recalled Kellywell surely be seeing that one on the red carpet soon Princess gowns have their place as Kelly more than proved in her lifetime but Khan would do well to curb his appetite for embellishment here A dress with a bustier emblazoned with a large glittering heart for instance verged into Disney heroine territory  That embellishment worked best when its design wasnt so overt Backstage Khan said that 600 people worked on the collection up close each gown was clearly a masterpiece so it was disappointing when the message became slightly muddled on the runway The sky-high platform heels seemed another misstep particularly as models struggled not to trip over the delicate skirts Khan has already proven his skill at creating gorgeous red carpetworthy gowns the designer doesnt need to dress it up so much In fact as happened with a few looks the extra fixings detracted from the main course$$Nanette Lepore always manages to inject a swipe of playfulness into her clothes Take this season when the designer introduced her collection at her downtown store transforming the presentation space into a full-on bash Ive always threatened to have a big party said Lepore And then I made fun clothes that people would want to go out in The attire matched the carefree scene ranging from cocktail pieces to daywear all with references that hovered between the late 60s and 70s (Time periods when everything was happening said Lepore) That feel-good let-loose attitude was evoked in an off-the-shoulder black eyelet dress while a floral-print frock in groovy neon blues and purples had a bohemian swing to it Cool retro separates came in a multi-patterned jacket with ruffled kimono sleeves and a polished pair of cropped flares  One infusion however brought the party into the here and now that was the segment of the show devoted to select pieces from Lepores collaboration with Eddie Eddie by Billy Tommy a line of shirts featuring cheeky statements and graphics worn by Miley Cyrus and Kendrick Lamar Lepore translated the statement-making text nicely into body-skimming silhouettes like a Pepto-pink slip dress that was emblazoned with Slippery When Wet and a bubblegum-lacquered midi skirt with a thigh-high slit that had This Is My Favorite Mini Skirt Duh printed on it But it was the Tie Me Up Please Thank You tube top cleverly paired with empire-waist pin-striped gaucho pants thats guaranteed to keep both Lepores grown-up and teenage customers equally entertained at any party$$Narciso Rodriguez is an engineer as much as he is a designer Hes always had a thing for seams and his clothes are constructed like precision instruments After a Fall collection with elongated silhouettes perched on towering heels that took his preoccupations to extremes Rodriguez was after something more sensual here Its a bit undone he said beforehand Outfit number one was a black sateen top as glossy as leather that wrapped asymmetrically around the waist above a pair of full white trousers Not undone by a long shot but it was definitely more relaxed than what hes been up to the last couple of seasons It was followed up with an extremely fitted side-buttoning jacket As a rule though the clothes here floated on the body Silk tees slouched off one shoulder and dresses twisted around the legs to fall in asymmetrical hems  The gentler silhouette was a welcome development So too was Rodriguezs use of fabrics with a keen sense of the hand the sateen that looked like leather and the nubby linen he chose for dresses that arched over one knee which by the way happened to be completely reversible to silk chiffon Tech fabrics tend to have a flatness that leaves you cold There wasnt a chance of that here Rodriguez explained that his starting point was photographs of the ocean floor but the palette was warm bright amber lacquer red and golden mineral rings that swooped across dresses and encircled others from front to back The sea creature embroidery on a bias-cut white silk dress was as exquisite as anything well see all season$$Many designers are rethinking the way they show their wares to press and buyers this season and Neil Barrett is among them In lieu of a jam-packed presentation the Milan-based Brit hung banners and plastered the floor of his Paris showroom with a camo-meets-kaffiyeh-scarf print inviting editors one by one to view his entirely colorless Spring collection Monochromatic after all is a tried-and-true signature for the designer (whose womens lineup remains unapologetically rooted in his menswear background) and the East-meets-West military pattern rings true with his rigorous creations that collide historical references through a linear lens This time around Barrett shook up that rigor by way of bold fringing and pleat details on slinky separates and accessories that loosened up his sleeveless tailoring and jacquard outerwear with a sporty lan Fringes can be fussy but here sliced bands of black leather and its vegan alternative (a savvy compromise for washable T-shirt dresses) read punchy and sleek as wide belts and slashed skirt layers both paired with fanning peplum shirts graphic minis or a generous fluid pant Layered in alternating scales Barretts somewhat militant graphics were softened through their tactile application Wide cotton weaves and a rich silk jacquard ensured zipped blousons and bomber jackets held a dressed-down eveningwear potential Those looks provoked the same twist of tomboy ease he worked into a sleeveless tux jacket thrown over collaged artist tees The series of three features Picasso Hockney and Basquiats faces peeking out from under a kaffiyeh Its an irreverent remix and a diabolical sign of the times$$Nellie Partow specializes in two very different categories tailoring and knitwear Neither lends itself particularly well to the concept of lightness but thats where Partow got to work on her Spring 16 collection Earlier this summer I was just standing in my closet and thinking about how difficult it is to find pieces that are really light and easy she explained You see a lot of silks and wools out there but not really beautiful cotton So she developed a superfine 37-gauge cotton with an Italian mill whipping it into semi-sheer sweaters that scarcely weighed more than tissue paper Elsewhere Partow used similarly buoyant materials such as stretch cotton jacquard fluid crepe and an airy weblike cotton ingrained with silk fibers In layering items like crisp shirts wide-leg pants and natty little blazers those fabrics skimmed the body rather than clung to it   Partow approached her popular hand-knits with a new sense of ease and structure Coated cotton held its shape on a boxy cardigan and different cabling techniques lent a bit of slouch to the designers signature rose gold cutout sweater I love the idea of one of these knits being your jacket she said The contrast between her sharply cut pantswhich have inspired a following of their ownand a nubby artisanal knit will appeal to women who think about texture and shape before print and embellishment Partows color palette also mirrored her quiet approach to luxury Refreshing shades of ice blue and orchid popped against cognac olive green and ivory$$Springs fodder may be new territory for Nicholas K but suffice it to say its in the brands DNA For their latest outing dubbed Terminal Velocity the sister-and-brother team of Nicholas and Christopher Kunz looked at flight suits after all their father was a flight surgeon their brother a Navy SEAL A tenor of utilitarianism was high from the word go starting with a cream-colored parachute trench worn by show opener Sarah Abney Like many of the other items it came with a cross-body rope clasped with a tough-looking carabiner The light glossy nylon the designers used billowed like silk and while it may have been an exploratory move they ran with it whipping yards of the fabric into maxi dresses skirts and ponchosso much as to blend together at times With dip-dyed styles otherworldly-looking silk dresses and trousers in shades of charcoal and saffron they had some real winners on their hands Among the 50 looks the pair might have done with a few more of the pieces akin to those and their capes in supple periwinkle denim clothes that nodded to the presence of a human hand All that nylon felt in places a little anonymous coming up short on covetabilitythough their gorgeous drop-waist jumpsuit in distressed leather surely did not$$Nicole Miller didnt have to look too far for inspiration this season I kind of became obsessed with the grate pattern you see on loading gates said the designer who had cast her eye about and found a petri dish of inspiration in her urban surroundings I took a lot of things very literally from the street she said No kidding One of the recurring prints was of a brick wall plastered with graffiti and the diamond grate motif popped up on denim and dresses and also informed a few sexy cutouts I wanted it to have the grit of New York explained Miller Gritty is not a word usually used to describe her brand and its introduction here may not be appreciated by Millers core customers However theyll find plenty to love in the sheath dresses and sequin maxi gownswhether theyre fans of graffiti or not  Some of the strongest pieces referenced other types of paintingless St Marks Place street art and more Jackson Pollock Indeed a black and white splatter print that appeared on handbags and denim instantly recalled the artist Other standouts included a white sheath dress embroidered with colorful scribbles and a white organza shift with brick-like embroidery and flower paillette appliqus This is where the collection hit its stride when Miller got to what she does best (pretty flattering dresses) and left most of the grit on the New York City sidewalks$$Its a stylists world and the rest of us may well just be living in it But for her Spring outing Nili Lotan harked back to a time when raw young talents were creating not only music but the kind of images that are still setting the tenor for much of what the industry strives for todaybefore every on-the-rise starlet had her look carefully crafted by a team of pros Pictures of Joan Baez Joni Mitchell Cat Stevens and Patti Smith lined Lotans mood board the designer particularly connected with the earnestness of Vietnam War-era singer-songwriters like Baez and Mitchell dubbing this collection Blue 1971 in an homage to the latter Likewise she called on her own 70s adolescence when she was beginning to cement the personal style that defines her brand today Springs free-spirited prcis fell right in step with the codes that have long kept Lotans followers coming back for more slouchy army pants and jackets gauzy bohemian tops and floor-skimming dresses Resorts bewitching eveningwear  la YSL gave way to a mix of casual and rakishly elegant pieces every one of them a wardrobe workhorse The smashing sailor pants looked natty against the gritty milieu of this seasons lookbook bien sr but would have plenty of Jane Birkin-esque appeal teamed with Lotans plunging blouses in sheer fluttering chiffon (Serge Gainsbourg and his longtime lover made up the European contingent on the designers mood board) The latter drew a stark and lovely contrast to a grouping of military-tinged items like a hardy utilitarian-looking dress in olive drab with gorgeous lace-up detailing Lotan may have streamlined the offering of her famously lush knits but with the wealth of winning options here fans are sure to find plenty to stock their wardrobes till fall$$Guillaume Henry has the goodwill of the fashion community He gave Carven which was a defunct couture house when he arrived in 2009 a global profile and a distinctive look Women responded to Carvens gamine sensibility and the brand grew quickly opening a store in New York Tonights show was Henrys second for Nina Ricci but he hasnt yet found his footing Its an issue more of tone than execution though both play a part His backstage mood board was pinned with pictures of Romy Schneider in the 1971 film Max et les Ferrailleurs and images of 90s models like Kate Moss Nadja Auermann and Kristen McMenamy Id love men to fall in love with [the Nina Ricci woman] he said  Thats not a bad goal but this was provocation without seduction a fact that came down to the stiffness of some of his materials the sheerness of others and a generally slack away-from-the-body silhouette The shows patent ostrich skin had a glossy almost lurid sheen but it was about as unyielding as materials get The black-and-white cowhide coat and apron-dress werent much more forgiving This will no doubt make us sound both American and prudish Considering Nina Ricci is a brand historically known for its lingerie it wouldve been nice to see a bra underneath Henrys sheer organza blousons But his see-through wrap skirts were an even bigger miss The best pieces here were the micro-pliss shifts which enhanced the models natural hourglass shapes Henry should keep them in mind when he begins working on his next collection$$Fashion may fall head over teakettle for decades in fullOh the 70s with their suede and their slouch Give us a 40s tea dress Or the 90s slipbut in real life real women reach into their closets to be confronted with (if theyre lucky) a living record of any variety of erasAlessandro DellAcqualeaned into this reality with his collection for Spring Its inspired by Corinne Dayso 90sand the fabulous Tina Modotti the designer said backstage before the show Modotti the actress and photographer died nearlyhalf a century before Days iconic snaps of Kate Moss which gives an idea of the temporal range DellAcqua was working with Its about inverting images overlapping and reworking masculine and feminine and quite sexy said the designer There were macram dresses in soft pastel shades crepe pinafores and cotton lace with chantilly overlay all in various stages of tumbling off the body to illustrate DellAcquas pointthough this was less an overt va-va-voom take on sexy than a slightly quiet Manic Pixie Dream Girl one (The diamond tiaras tangled in some models hair aided in the latter notion) Caban-style jackets boasted Latin-inspired ruffles and pom-pom trims narrow overalls came in lace wrap skirts made of strips of python leather and worn with striped boxy tops resembled nothing so much as a backgammon boardand oh the rules of love There were also worn under nearly everything white T-shirts tank tops and deconstructed button-downs with ties left dangling to the windCrepede Chine blouses and jumpers boasted a delicate design that upon further inspection became a subtle in-joke lit cigarettes trailing swirls of smoke (Remember 90s) Berbere inspired sandals (pom-poms feathers sequins) were equally anything-goes and it was all resoundingly for the girl who doesnt dress for the decade shes in (or even the decade she wishes it to be) so much as wholly for herself$$As the owner of New York Citys well-loved Centre Market Place boutique of the same name Karin Bereson knows how her No 6 customer shops Her new lineup played savvily to that with a first delivery that was all about cheery 60s- and 70s-hued nostalgia for some much needed sunny vibes in the midst of winter and a second delivery thats all about easy pieces to transition nicely into spring Of course ease is a key selling point of all of Beresons wares Its a subtle evolution from season to season with familiar shapes making comebacks in cheeky prints or jolie laide colors but recent collections have found the designers gamine sensibilities imbued by a new feeling of femininity That came to life most winningly in looks like a pieced-together slip dress in blush linen and silk which would pair just as nicely with sneakers as it would stilettos It had a kind of understated sexiness about it that felt like a particularly nice addition to the spectrum Bereson and her team regularly offer up Still if many of No 6s shoppers are longtime clients who keep coming back for classic mainstays like jumpsuits or the labels terrific culottes and drop-crotch trousers they surely wont bristle at Springs great new expansion efforts First and most notably are four soign footwear styles all made in Peru and all as Bereson puts it shoes that disappear The eminently shoppable bag offering has expanded too building on Resorts leather bucket bag with a half-moon woven shape for the beach and a killer patchworked suede tote No 6 first dipped a toe into the waters of swim for Spring 15 and here turned out two bikinis and two maillots plus a Don Draperpoolside terry-lined shirt and shortsone of the lineups coolest propositions$$And now for something completely different Kei Ninomiya is quietly and painstakingly riveting together a darkly wonderful body of work This collection contained more of his inky-black intricately engineered dresses made by bolting scores of curled polyester organdy strips rendered flowerlike in shape held together with a skeleton of tiny studs The dresses contain not a single stitch and float around the wearer Ninomiyas shapes were more adventurous this time than last and featured jagged sculptural protrusions He has also discovered that when he turns these pieces inside out there is a different texture to their beauty These are amazing but challenging to wear signature pieces  A touch less Lady Gaga but no less dense-with-effort was the dress containing a twist of 7000 hand-applied beads that took two people three days to construct That was the longest said Ninomiya A biker jacket of transparent vinyl worn over some pinstripe culottes was stitched together with a macram of plastic cord another biker was decorated with jagged lines of more transparent plastic and yet another biker with a satin sheen featured arms constructed of Ninomiyas signature studded organdy whose segments undulated over each other and strongly resembled a ravens wings I make things in a new way said Ninomiya And so he does rather brilliantly$$Nurses scrubs may not at first thought set most womens hearts aflutter But inspirations such as that underscore Yara Flinns knack for marrying utilitarianism with lean youthful elegance Spring found the Nomia designer riffing on workwear of different sorts from those aforementioned scrubs (nodded to in a sporty V neck) to fabrications in denim ticking which Flinn stumbled on in researching uniforms at the Mets Costume Institute Reference Library That ticking came to life beautifully as a kimono with raw denim trim  Consistency is a key element of Flinns lineups from season to season hallmarks like her patch pockets and D-ring details tie an evolving body of work neatly together Chances are that her customers can make space in their wardrobes for another of her classic slit-back dusters as well as a newer style for Nomia the terrific slinky one-sleeved dress$$When in doubt go with a classic Today the All In One Dress a style Norma Kamali first introduced back in 1973 became the cornerstone of her Spring collection After seeing a serious response from her distributors the designer is taking a fresh look at the shape sending it out in three lengths (maxi mini and medium) and a variety of prints Wear it as-is with its funnel neck and dolman sleeves or pull an arm through the collar and wear it one-sleeved with the other one tied around your waistper Kamali the possibilities are damn near endless Even if the DIY opportunities of that piece dont delight its charm is mirrored in so many of Kamalis garments Ball them up and toss in a carry-on throw in the wash and start all over again That goes for shapes like her fishtail flare which kicked out in a full circle from the knee and some spruce activewear tailoring While those are sure to please new converts to the Kamali lifestyle for the customer who comes back season after season the designer served up a generous offering of new prints from a splashy painted floral to trompe l'oeil jean patchwork Even better was the real deal a series of fraying raw denim styles like a trench and kicky skirt all reversible and all very cool$$Art has always played a big role in Jordana Warmflash's collections for Novis but while references to Henri Matisse may have skewed too literal in the past a more pared-back approach for Spring should catch buyers attention She drew inspiration from Clarice Cliffs graphic slightly rustic pottery for her vibrant color palette of mint cerulean and poppy while hits of black and white ensured the clothes were for the most part still quite wearable Sleeker silhouettes helped that cause too Column gowns A-line skirts and razor-sharp trousers acted like blank slabs of porcelain to be decorated with geometric prints kitschy landscapes and matte beading Print and color are integral to the Novis message but Warmflash should continue to explore texture as well The best pieces featured a soft color-blocked crochet which captured the theme but also had a warm artisanal feeling that will appeal to a wide range of customers$$Our newness right now is not really newness and to us thats the newness Thats Oaks Louis Terline on the tack the well-loved New Yorkbased brand is taking He makes a valid point The breakneck pace of not just fashion but the world can hardly be sustainable And so Terline and cofounder Jeff Madalena have zeroed in on their obsessions the things that keep an expansive demographic coming back to their stores and website pieces like killer leather jackets knits and trousersall at varying levels of inkiness The other newness Taking cues from the hip employees of Oaks four shops pullovers worn inside out for example or almost comically oversize Those styling tweaks yielded coolly subtle reinventions of staple pieces dropping a sweatshirt shoulder by two inches or adding say 15 to a baseball jacket Where youth culture in fashion is typically something that has trickled so far down as to be totally divorced from whence it came something feels authentic in Terline and Madalenas buy-now-wear-now riffs on what their employees are doing Beyond that their clothes are just plain cool and wearable to boot As Terline tells it theyre always designing back to the jeans For Spring Oaks denim will team with workwear-inspired quilting and sporty touches like a zip-front funnel-neck topall in the brands signature monochromatic palette For the record all that black is as much function as it is fashion chalked up by the designers to tiny New York City apartments with finite storage and the citys general grime But lest things get too geocentric Terline and Madalena havent forgotten their more far-flung followers This season for LA fans the designers are introducing a lightweight take on their classic motorcycle jacketjust new enough$$When will girls stop pining after vintage jeans The high-rise straight-leg style (whether actually vintage or just vintage-inspired) has become more than a trendits totally changed the way we dress Alexandra Michelle was doing non-stretch boy jeans at Objects Without Meaning before everyone else started cutting up their Levis and she quickly earned a cult following for them But the key to Michelles success is that she also answers the question of what to wear with her jeans offering a steady range of luxurious collectible basics like silk camisoles ribbed-knit turtlenecks and linen T-shirts Her approach is as no-frills as it gets minimal silhouettes are elevated with comfy high-quality fabrics and there are zero prints or embellishments save for an unraveling hem here or a twisted strap there It gives her customers room to layer style and accessorize as they please For Spring Michelle expanded both her denim and basics categories First she got a bit more experimental with her indigo Some jeans had blurred squares of darker blue mimicking a patchwork effect while an A-line button-front skirt had a released hem She styled it over ribbed lounge pants elsewhere some of Michelles best-selling powder-blue flares peeked out from under a tea-length poplin dress Those new layering ideas felt freshest hereshe also put her own spin on head-to-toe knit dressing and introduced her first swimsuits which were spare enough to be worn under cardigans and denim shorts$$For someone who has orchestrated theatrically imposing and occasionally improvised stage environments for Kanye West a dfil of 20 looks within a compact contemporary art gallery would seem like no big deal But as this was Virgil Ablohs first runway show for his label Off-Whiteas well as his 35th birthdaythe occasion felt well special Abloh titled his collection Off-Day although not out of some reverse-karmic pre-emptive strike As he explained the latest Off-White undertaking emerged from several streams of thought but principally how cool girls today have figured out that the most relevant dress code has nothing to do with dressing up Abloh (who earned a masters in architecture) used a white tee and blue jeans as his building blocks which he subsequently broke down to arrive at a draped crepe tuxedo top an open-sided gilet tiered maxi sack skirt and flocked grid-pattered pajamas among other transformations Some combination of cropping lengthening offsetting patchworking bias cutting and hand-pleating went into each look And thats not even accounting for the time Abloh spent at the Levi Strauss & Co archives (six pairs of jeans were reworked from the companys denim) or going through the necessary legal channels to redesign an old Grateful Dead crew shirt (via illustrator Othelo Gervacio) All told a lot of effort And yet for Abloh this wasnt enough I want to push the concept of showing in front of an audience in Paris he declared backstage I want it to be a reminder that this is still an art formnot just the

Positioned upside down it spelled out Why are you looking at which Abloh attributed to the ongoing refrain among those who binge on fashion shows so heavily that nothing ultimately registers So was this show any different To the extent that it came across as a multilayered exercise in self-expression yes But often a single lookthose jeans spliced with organza windowpanes for exampleis all it takes$$Really there are any number of ways to do summer style For some theres the desire for the easy the breezy and the often sheer for others theres a chain-fringed bandeau and trouser boasting a Justin Bieberesque quasi-harem drape For either (for both) there is Ohne Titels Spring 2016 collection As usual there were the technically advanced knits the house is known for seen in body-conscious one-shouldered tops and skirts bodysuits bikinis and a red and white fit-and-flare frock that sunny Sunday dreams are made of Nearly all the knits had geometrical patterns painstakingly woven in New for Ohne Titel were the entirely fetching gauzy pleated caftan dresses lightweight pieces in bright summery shades and a series of fringed bra tops skirts and a dress crafted from the chains of ball bearings Off-the-shoulder viscose rompers and separates came in shades of crimson and magenta that felt fresh and easy and easily imagined on any number of vacationing It girls from Montauk to Ibiza But it was a geometrically printed silk shirtdress long lean and slashed at the shoulders in a deep teal and navy combination that felt like the biggest advance made in the pursuit of true summer style$$Olympia Le-Tan doesnt merely infuse her collections with her own personalityshe injects them with her life-experiences too This was an autobiographically touched collage of homage to her relationship with Japan one that Le-Tan first determined to make after hearing of the demolition of her favorite Tokyo hotel the Okura So Hotel Olympia ran the cursive script on the front of her reverse souvenir jacket with a coiled rope logo to reflect her interestan aesthetic one she emphasizedin kinbaku (Japanese bondage)  Binding twisted at the ankle of her hyper-stylized Louboutin geta

recurring cinematic motif The Polaroid prints were illustrations by Le-Tans father Pierre of pictures taken by the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki including some of the designer Eclectic and authentic this collection was particularvery particularto Le-Tan herself That should make it ultra-appealing to her followers Fetishists and Hello Kitty obsessives will no doubt be stimulated too$$A fashion industry vet I know once joked that given the reiteration of certain themes among designers hed like the opportunity to assign fresh concepts to brands Farm-to-table was one of the concepts he proposed Opening Ceremony honchos Carol Lim and Humberto Leon never lack for inventive references and this season they came up with one pretty similar to farm-to-table all on their own Their set in a cavernous space on Wall Street was a marvel to beholdabout a zillion potted plants which will be replanted after the show at four schools around the city as part of the Edible Schoolyard NYC program That worthy initiative was one expression of the new Opening Ceremony collections larger theme Frank Lloyd Wright Wright Lim and Leon explained had a daughter who was a modern dancer and he often designed sets for her shows And as an architect he was concerned with the idea of a home as a set for livingthe place where people perform the daily rituals that taken together add up to a life He was also a fan of intentional communities self-sustaining mini utopias organized on much the same logic as that of indigenous tribes These were all interesting paths to explore via fashion but the problem with this evenings OC outing was that Lim and Leon chose to explore all of them at once The intentional community ideathat would have been a lively and timely organizing principle for a collection but the designers diverted it into the set The dance element came through in the inclusion of dancers who performed seemingly spontaneous choreography among the shows models Mainly the clothes dilated on the theme of home and the decorative elements that make one up Lim and Leon are particularly eclectic in their tastes so their riff on this reflected that sensibility with mixed results This was a difficult collection to wrap your head around Wright-era design elements were one motif imparted for instance in the prevalence of sand tones in the palette and knit dresses and skirts with a weave like that of mid-century chairs Architecture in general got a look notably in the jumpsuits and tunics that featured inverted arch-shaped necklines These were the collections most direct looks and among its very best The laid-back mood of at-home lounging was referenced in silk garments with a certain pajama mien those that featured chinoiserie embroidery boasted surprising streetwise appeal There were other pieces as well that lent a global magpie aesthetic to the proceedings It was easy to isolate standout individual itemsthis collection was especially strong in its trouser silhouettes and its knitsbut the showing as a whole never really cohered It left you wondering what the uniform of a Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned utopia might have been That farm-to-table conceptits still up for grabs$$I knew this dame was trouble as soon as she walked into my office     The femme fatale is a recurring trope in fashion but its safe to say that none have looked quite like the muse of John Patricks film noirinfluenced new collection Patrick was mostly taking his cues from the high-contrast lighting used in classics of the genre but he also had the wit to propose that trouble of the dame variety neednt come in a slinky red-lipped package Trouble can also be fresh-faced and clad in boyish cropped trousers and a matching jacket or a virginal shift of crisp cotton poplin or a preppy cardigan and high-waist mini Even the cleanest-cut girl has at some point in her life longed to make (or be) trouble Not that Patrick avoided slinkiness entirely In fact this was a sexier outing than usual for him Alongside the slouchy all-Americana staples much of a piece with previous Organic collections there were body-hugging slip dresses in a squishy mesh-like knit and flirty looks in neon tulle and lace An ankle-length T-shirt dress in that neon tulle went so far as to conjure the lurid atmosphere of the Vegas Strip Apparently the Organic girl has a dark side too$$Its been 20 years since Orla Kielys signature leafy prints showed themselves to the world The Irish designer marked the moment in swinging style today with a presentation of adorable clothes and accessories that revealed her secret passion crazy golf the sport also known as mini golf or Putt-Putt I dont play actual golf Kiely admitted gesturing to the sprawling stage set that provided the backdrop for her Spring collection But I love crazy golf Its just so fun And as the sun shone through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Royal Institute of British Architects the models wasted no time in pulling up their cute floral-patterned caddies and taking a putt Kiely pulled her muted palette of coral lime and lilac from the poolside photographs of Slim Aarons and the clothes conjured an uncomplicated trip to Palm Springs California I always love the 60s and 70s said Kiely And its Palm Springs that really sets the tone for that era The silhouettes swung from pinafores and shift dresses to loose flowing jumpsuits all tethered to that mid-century feel The standout moment came in the form of a chartreuse shorts suit in heavy jacquard which made for wholly appropriate sundowner attire Though the swans and windmills and oversize poodle (perhaps inspired by house stylist Leith Clarks much-loved pet pooch) were all well played it was Kiely who really hit a hole in one$$Whats new in a glutted knitwear market The trio behind Orley husband-and-wife team Matthew and Samantha Orley and Matts brother Alex are hard at work figuring out just that Yarns are the bread-and-butter for the brand and so for its third womens offering (the first season Fall 15 was picked up by Barneys) the designers wisely opted to emphasize their foundation in knitwear before branching out into wovens Of an all-knit lineup the team estimated 70 percent to be Italian-loomed the rest handmade in New York and stressed their desire to create a narrative not just a really nice cashmere sweater That end game was clear from the word go with every piece of the Spring lineup speaking to a certain off-kilter almost Tenenbaum-esque take on preppiness from polo shirts to sweater vests (yep sweater vests) Take a cotton-cashmere pleated skirt in a mod-looking custom graphic print It had a splash of retro quirk to it without feeling overly precious A pair of mulberry and tussah silk flares though sat firmly on this side of the 21st century and echoed the industrys current yen for head-to-toe sweater dressingso polished you could take them to the office but so forgivingly stretchy you might just opt to wear them for SVU reruns at home too Things heated up in a cable-knit pullover with a surprisingly sexy back and open panels the result of crocheting around laser-cut plastic discs  At a recent studio preview Alex emphasized the importance of not just reworking their mens styles for womensix months from now the trio expect their girls business to outstrip their guys Here was a lineup that was strong but also single-minded enough that youd look forward to seeing how the label will diversify next season One of the collections standouts a crocheted shift in cherry-red and white stripes offered a promising hint$$Possibly it seems ridiculous to begin a fashion show review with a discussion about the precisely desirable color of a carnation Yet it is a fact that there is a vast gulf of taste between a deli-cum-gas-station pink or white type of a carnation and the deep deep almost cinnamon-dark kind of a red carnation which Oscar de la Renta picked for his daily buttonhole when he was a young man living in Madrid But the fact that Peter Copping Oscars successor picked up on that color and its resonances is a perfect testament to his suitability for the job He like Oscar has a phenomenal eye for color and social tone Apparently said Copping before the show they used to throw red carnations into the ring after a bull fight Which explains the presence of carnation prints in various sizes that Copping scattered on dresses swathed skirts and frilled blouses and the fact that he saturated an eyelet dress in the color of Oscars favorite flower Copping was partially inspired by his discovery that De la Renta had met Ava Gardner whose lover was a bullfighter in the 1950s But to research the Spring collection he had also been up to the Hispanic Society of Harlem to look at their paintings surrounding bullfightinghe took in everything from the pale blue satin of a matador suit painted by Goya to the exact shade of baked yellow Francis Bacon used in a bullfighting scene to the colors of peasant wool embroidery on popular Spanish postcards said Copping Then he let it all percolate in his imagination and came up with a collection that thoroughly proved his own powers as a colorist and as a designer who brings the finesse of Paris with him from all the years he worked at Louis Vuitton and Nina Ricci The combination of respectfulness for the founder and pure personal flair made for a collection that succeeded in making every woman present at the show want to be part of Coppings ravishing modern view of femininity and sexuality The sight of his models scrubbed and groomed with matte red lipstick their hair brushed smoothly into ponytails with low grosgrain ribbon bows made fashions prevailing messy no-makeup grungy beauty suddenly look a whole lot less desirable at a stroke It was not just a question of the breathtaking color choices which ran from saturated to pastelsay emerald green duchesse satin for a skirt suit with a narrow powder pink belt or the grass green embroidered shoes under a mint gazar dressbut also of Coppings ability to undercut froth and frills with a modernizing casualness He did that by putting suits with jet-embroidered flat espadrilles by tying black ribbons nonchalantly into incredible lilac and ice-blue ball gowns and by daring to show glimpses of naked skin through black lace In a word it was faultless$$Plenty of designers have found inspiration in the Amazon jungle but very few have actually visited the place let alone camped there and participated in tribal rituals But then Oskar Metsavahta UNESCO Goodwill ambassador and former doctoris not like most designers  One year ago I went to the Amazon forest and met the Ashninka tribe and was invited to their rituals said Metsavaht The whole collection is inspired by that experience The narrative begins with the monochromatic blue looks in contrasting silk and suede inspired by the ocean and a photo-printed silk dress that referenced the designer's overhead view of the jungle as he flew in As Metsavahts stay with the Ashninka continued he began to incorporate the tribes element of stylethe materials and colors Linen pieces in white or earthy taupe some of which were tied in organic knots at the hip or waist had an attractive rough-hewn quality The lone red look constructed from a latex silk blend that Metsavaht developed was like a red feather sticking up at the back of a headdress And the tribes characteristic face paint was incorporated to surprisingly sophisticated effect in the sheer looks with graphic black lines Bags were made from fish skin an homage to the tribe's practice of using every part of the animal It was a clever translation of a culture that is worlds away from New York Citys hustle and bustle and one that will be as appreciated on these American streets as well as on the beaches in Metsavahts native Brazil Beyond the feathers and face paint what really inspired Metsavaht was the Ashninkas respect for beauty The meaning of aesthetics is very important for them he said Beauty for them means strength and sensualityfor man or for woman And thats exactly what fashion is For Metsavaht who juggles sustainability with a luxury sensibility the Ashninka reinforced an idea about which he is already passionate That fashion frivolous though it may sometimes  be portrayed is far from meaningless$$I ask you for violence in the nonsense and you you give me grace your light and your warmth Osman Yousefzada quoted a wonderful pang-of-passion Frida Kahlo love letter in his notes while references to both her art and her personal style were scattered here and there throughout this collection The beaded tree decorations in the closing looks some of the suiting and Stephen Joness take on Kahlos trademark headbands were among the most sharply drawn Yet Yousefzada insisted with a touch of weariness that such accents were mere mood music For me its just the same thing that I do again and again Clothes basically Which I think women will want And thats what its about Well yes Whether women will want these clothes depends on the women Certainly Osman has a fan base thats especially dedicated to his raved-about suite of pants He is exploiting this happy niche not just by extending his selection of cuts but by extending his market to the most pant-dependent constituencythis collection featured his first runway menswear which starred notable horizontal moire corduroy jackets with a lapel shape imported from cutouts featured in his Fall womenswear collection Although that beading looked fine and the silhouette was dramatic Osmans closing yellow column dress was clearly a trial for the model to walk in More harmonious amalgamations of theory and practice included the striking same-shade halter-neck tiered dress in waxed duchesse silk and his blown-up ikat brocade on blown-up silhouettes The skirted three-tiered pants combined daintiness and jaunt This collection featured a lot more flashes of grace than nonsense$$Every valid fashion show has a built-in sense of its place in the world of where the clothes fit in and where people are supposed to find it exciting and useful to wear them Complex conceptual scenarios from deep within a designers brain can only fascinate so much if the clothes dont have any imaginable destination other than a fashion shoot or awards ceremony So one of the subtexts running through this season is the need for fashion to readjust widen its perspective and stop excluding so many peoples realities Smart creative minds can sketch in an environment subliminally which is exactly what Julien Dossena was up to today at Paco Rabanne as he ran a patched-in mixed-up soundtrack on which the far-off noise of a live performance seemed to boom in the distance Actually that noise was heard at Chlo too And we all relate to what that means festival sounds the new massive social dressing-up opportunity for a generationfrom the beginning of every summer to its end Dossenas collection nailed that context cleverly merging high-tech sportiness with a sense of casual disheveled sexiness Bra-topped baby doll dresses unraveling at the hems walked alongside fitted motocross-influenced leathers silver and khaki anoraks and parkas track pants and vaguely 70s sweaters printed with abstracted Native American motifs On the feet a practical very cool series of suede cut-down biker-cum-Western boot-shoes ideal for coping with desert terrain mud and all-night dancing   At the end Dossena paid direct homage to Paco Rabannes signature space-age chain mail by showing slinky gold dresses and asymmetrical skirts roughed up around the edges with yarn chain stitching or thrown together with an army green sweater Perfectly calibrated as potential stagewear or perhaps just for hanging out in a backstage VIP tent next summer In the 60s Paco Rabanne might have imagined wed all be living on the moon by 2015 but actually this is really where weve landed$$What do you want to wear Thats the question that empire-builders Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor ask each other at the outset of their design process each season Then they take a look at what Nash-Taylors daughter is currently wearing and from that informal poll they conjure a collection This season the duos proposition erred toward the hippie-ish with asymmetrical knit dresses and skirts and slouchy graphic tees providing the contemporary counterpoint to such Easy Riderera staples as fringed suede jackets embroidered peasant blouses and studded leather miniskirts There were other updates toothe patchwork flares for instance were of trompe loeil denim-dyed French terry and the frequently deployed camel-colored suede found its way into sporty items such as track pants The designers want their casual clothes to wear like basics but not look like them and with that in mind they embellished tees and sweaters with knot details and fringe and finished numerous pieces with a mottled wash that added to the collections overarching vintage sensibility The Pam & Gela clothes are flying out the door at the stores where theyre soldapparently when Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor ask each other what they want to wear they furnish an answer many young women agree with$$Todays Pamella Roland affair was the inaugural fashion show to be staged at the Whitney Museum of American Arts new Meatpacking digs If its somewhat surprising that that particular honor didnt go to an artsier designer it should be noted that Roland does sit on the museums board and has been passionately involved in the new space since its earliest days What then would a label that is fluent in mermaid dresses and marked by a kind of princess-y exuberance when it comes to full-throttle glamour offer up for a turn at this bastion of the avant-garde As the designer put it backstage You cant show in a museum and not do art  Roland was especially interested in the work of Frank Stella known for his large-scale geometric paintings in Technicolor palettes (a major retrospective bows at the Whitney in late October) She evoked that oeuvre in subtle ways Some of her nicest propositions came through in a series of silk gowns whose fronts were folded up origami-style to expose the fabrics brilliantly hued undersides Liquid organza was surprisingly techy in a floor-grazing blush number but the huge floppy bow it appeared as on a column gown fell a little flat Rolands real successes here were the ones in which Stellas spirit seemed to guide her most the punchy and relatively spare pieces (though it was hard to deny that a wild-card crystal-encrusted jumpsuit would look pretty great on Mary J Blige who sat front-row) The more precious items like a strapless bubble-hemmed minidress in sea-foam with white roses or a jewel-trimmed 50s-feeling evening coat seemed to run counter to both the designers message and the venue$$No fewer than 11 graduates of Parsons School of Designs esteemed MFA program (Fashion Design and Society) which is touted as the first in the nation of its kind both conceptual and skills based showcased their thesis collections today They were Katherine Mavridis Liya Liu Long Xu Mayako Kano Diletta Cancellato Pengji Cai Ryohei Kawanishi Shih Hsun Lee Sisi Liu Tianfang Jing and Varpu VernaHel Rapeli If their collective output is anything to go by the future of fashion will be a studiously creative place Four of the students were on hand to discuss their work and used pitch-perfect industry parlance in doing so Mavridis from Australia described her technique of weaving tightly coiled tubes into enormous shapes that hardly need a human body to fill them out New Zealander Kano spoke of the delicacy of Meiji-period Japanese photographs in particular the now-faded pigments used for preservation to explain her lacy confections Hailing from China Liya Liu said New York Citys mountains of street garbage waiting for pick up inspired the nylon trash bags of her collection almost none of which were actually sewn as did the enormous amount of waste that goes on in the garment trade And most irreverent of all Kawanishi looked to Dadaism to create the mundane quotidian stupid serious objects on his runway ranging from a bath mat and a toilet paper dispenser to closet hangers and FedEx envelopes Other strong showings came from Xu who used a bamboo-weaving technique from his native China to craft his intricate multicolored pieces Hsun Lee the only mens designer this year who combined  traditional mens tailoring and skateboard gear Sisi Liu who enlarged the ornamental flowers of her box-making hobby into large-scale 3-D versions and Jing also from China who made her ethereal collection by printing folded paper with translucent film In addition to the schools revered course director Shelley Fox Parsonss new dean of fashionand expert in sustainabilityBurak Cakmak was also on hand One of the most important things we teach is that students should have fun he said We allow them to choose their own guiding principles Cakmak replaces Simon Collins Parsonss outgoing dean who was very visibly reveling in the fun his final students were having$$Paul & Joe sent out a metallic pink embossed postcard as the invitation for its Spring show but it may as well have been fronted with a photo of Miami Thats where founder Sophie Mechaly mined references for a collection that was fun frisky and swathed in palm fronds More precisely she said she drew from Scarface and Magnum PI to arrive at key looks such as the halter maxi dresses and slim pastel pantsuits Just as there will always be flora and fauna prints in a Paul & Joe collection so too will there be modified denim sweet flourishes (broderie anglaises ruffle accents) and a boyish wink (shirts or shoes) the difference each season comes from how Mechaly doses them The Miami throwback allowed for a new twist retro jogging attire remixed as silk blousons and shorts or hybridized as a studded tuxedo pant The theme also meant she could go gutsy on glitz from the silver leather trousers to the sequined baby doll and the metallic boots Just in case those pieces didnt sufficiently incite the spirits she added a vintage-style T-shirt with the line Go for it Mechaly was already wearing it like a souvenir from the show$$Paul Smith and his wife Pauline Denyer Smith were once couture show regulars and to this day one of Paulines prize possessions is the last Smoking ever made by Yves Saint Laurent Preshow this afternoon Sir Paul said When you hold that suit the weight is amazingit gives this lovely drape Drape was one of the key preoccupations of this collection which while obviously not produced on a couture level managed to force its fabrics elegantly to assert their designers will against the implacable tug of gravity Thus the first dressa silk-screened mlange of orange on two clashing patternssignaled the turned-up volume Sir Paulstyle of many of the looks that followed The colors were drawn from David Hockney while the disjunctive block shapes of the printed panels looked to be mined from Henri Matisse appropriate enough for a show held at the Serpentine Galleries Smith makes a masterful pant and is especially sensitive to the subtleties of the break Todays finest broke lavishly on a pair that came wide-legged and pin-tucked in gray wool worn under a matching jacket with a lean lapel that featured six mysteriously nonfunctional buttons Elsewhere a short-sleeved asymmetrically hemmed jacket challenged the masculine codes from which it was drawn The croc cross straps on colorful rubber-clad platforms echoed the built-in cross-body suspenders that recurred throughout the collection while the houses newly boosted accessories team delivered some harmonious harmonica handbags and a tote so ingeniously colored that it seemed to be its own light source$$In June one year after the departure of founder Serge Cajfinger Paule Ka named a new creative designer Alithia Spuri-Zampetti The 31-year-old Central Saint Martins grad comes directly from a six-year stint at Lanvin where most recently she was the head designer of womenswear Market categories notwithstanding the leap in sensibility between the two brands isnt a huge one her background is probably very appealing for Paule Ka which occupies an untapped nichecall it accessible elegancebut lacks the cachet Spuri-Zampettis influence however will not be noticeable until next season which means the current collection represents a studio-designed placeholder And given the flux it came across as sure and steady Beyond the brands standby trapeze dress there were several other day-to-night variations each distinguished by some combination of polished fabric (crisp faille fluid cloque cotton tricotine) or punchy color (hibiscus sky blue citron) Everydayand every nightnovelty seemed to be the through line from pastel brocade outerwear to a loosely interpreted tuxedo-style strapless dress Bonus points if you identified the puzzle-piece pattern as MC Escher applied here and there to skirts dresses and knits it took a stronger stance than standard houndstooth But the strongest design of all was a flattering sheath slit from below the knee up each leg and fronted with a sculptural knot On the hanger it seemed sleek enough on the body it had a magic effect$$The Martini-drinking Los Angeles stylist Shirley Kurata was the driving force behind Peter Jensens Spring 2016 show today Jensen marked his 16th year in fashion and a return to the official London schedule with a no-holds-barred homage to Kuratas Pop Art sensibility Inspiration certainly struck from close quarters this season The eclectic stylist who has recently been responsible for the red carpet reinvention of Lena Dunham has worked on Jensens shows for some five years after the pair hit it off at Vogues Fashions Night Out in New York City  Jensens enduring affection for a 60s silhouette held fast this season It was embodied here in a mod secretary look that meshed with what he explained as a vintage 80s vibe This came through first and foremost in the fabricationwith cream skirt suits and shift dresses in toweling (a throwback to the designers time living in Hollywood that motherland of the velour tracksuit) but also in the cacti-stitched polo shirts The seasonless standouts were the pretty camera-print dresses worn over shirtingand the heavily sequined white socks and visors that finished every look Jensen took the idea of the muse to its outer reaches both with the sweater that read Shirley Shirley Shirley and the step-and-repeat print comprised of hundreds of faceless Shirleys This homage to the Tinseltown stylist was always going to have an emphasis on fun$$Heres a query about long flared culottes Granted they are being worn around the streets this season in their tailored form but will they have legs next season in lemon or pale blue semi-sheer seersucker Peter Pilotto took a gamble on them for Spring and on the evidence he provided the answer is Unlikely For the past few seasons Pilotto has been carefully orienting his collections in a way that moves him away from being defined as a print designer In this one he decided to concentrate mainly on solid colors and diaphanous texturesThe signature prints he made his name with were de-emphasized and reduced to graphic lines stamped with black on white circles and triangles that ran along segmented skirts The stronger part of Pilottos vision for Spring lay in his reprise of the midi-skirted silhouette he innovated a while back at a point when no-one else was thinking about that gracefully attenuated line That proved prescient and the continuation of that line which today appeared with tailored sleeveless wrap-over jackets worked to his advantage as did the dresses and skirts cut in pale layers of diaphanous lace Along the way Pilotto also picked up on some of the themes which are swirling in the fashion ether drawstring details tiered flounces and asymmetrical frills On the rack in stores all of those things will no doubt have appeal as high summer fare But do they stand out as recognizably Peter Pilotto Thats debatable Every young designer deserves the chance to develop but sometimes customers are reluctant to let go of what they found compelling about a label in the first place$$Get ready to hear a lot more about Phelan The new label by former Alexander Wang knitwear designer Amanda Phelan launched this afternoon with a bang The show seated theater style was led off by an extraordinary four-woman performance choreographed by Vim Vigor Dance Company founder Shannon Gillen and it concluded with the assembly onstage of models clad in some of the most innovative looks to come from a young New York designer in quite some time The rapturous applause was earned The dance wasnt just for show As Phelan explained movement is key to her brands identity and she wanted every element of her first collection and its presentation to speak to that theme Its plainest expression was via the knits which displayed a staggering level of technical invention There were knits popcorned and puckered ones gossamer sheer and others patterned in graphic intarsia The jaw-dropper was an accordion-knit silver dress that came off armor-like from a distance but was revealed to be pliable and lightweight when studied close-up Phelan was clearly stretching her knitwear muscles here but she spent the wealth of her Wang experience in another way too Aside from a few longeurs these were street-ready commercial looks Phelans movement theme also extended to the woven pieces It was evident in an abstract brushstroke print and in here-and-there fringe embellishment A long cotton skirt was slit up the front to accommodate a long stride and the blinding metallic pieces captured motion through light Phelan made and remade the same point but the sheer variety of ways she found to tell the same story kept the storytelling from feeling heavy-handed If anything the quibble here was that the looks the dancers wore also by Phelan werent included in the official runway collection The dancers high-waisted wide-leg cropped trousers demonstrated movement in the best way possiblethrough the furious aliveness of bodies$$As hundreds of hands simultaneously lifted their personal screens to ensure by-proxy digestion of the sight in front of their eyesCourtney Love in ripped jeans sliding down a mechanical runway singing to the backing of two glow-eyed Terminator-touched robot guitaristsit was easy to see Philipp Pleins point In his bare backstage office before this show wired on Red Bull and super-stressed in the expectation of imminent catastrophe he had observed Our life today is dominated by machines and electronic gadgets Like your phone is dominating your life and your navigation system is helping you to go from A to B Without our gadgets it is really hard these days for us to survive Which is true When that show started there were very few people in the audienceand certainly not mewho werent holding up their machines to prove their presence in the room Plein had decided to throw this Orwellian showthink Metropolis meets prt--porter meets Alexander McQueen Spring 99after watching the Alex Garlandscripted and directed film Ex Machina on a flight back to Italy from his second home in Los Angeles The idea he had was to use robots to equip the models as they proceeded on conveyer belts down the catwalk In stop-starts they moved forward as if on an assembly line and the industrial machines handed them their accessoriessunglasses handbags and the rest It was a show to chill the hearts of stylists everywhere  Yet when we met backstage Plein had just learned that two weeks of programming had crashed and the robots werent working He was kvetching hard-core Luckily some adroit IT specialistperhaps  someone turned the robots off then on againmeant that by showtime (only 52 minutes late) all was as planned Love bloomed forth sang her song and afterward the models made their chillingly passive progress down the runway The collection (oh yes) was an extension of the punk theme that Plein had plucked from the ether for his most recent menswear collection He is a pop designer and the clothes are pop too Many in fashion dismiss them as schlock but there is design behind these clothes apparent paucity of it Patched with fake album cover art and slogan badges and very often machine gunned with studs these were as maximalist-ly expressed as his theme They were obviouswhich is Pleins whole in-your-face MO  Not long afterward I found Love She was settling into her chair at the post-show dinner Asked if it was challenging to perform with robots she said Well I rehearsed just once and it was quite scary But actually the robots were very well behaved It was sliding down on the conveyorI had to rehearse that a few times And was that her most bananas fashion show experience ever No But its up there$$Lorenzo Serafini established himself as a dress man at his Philosophy debut for Fall 15 His second runway collection was very much an evolution of his first Victoriana by way of the 70s with a hint of the undone prairie girl Erdem Moralioglu covered similar ground in London but where his frocks had a special occasion sense of hauteur Serafinis dresses are designed to be lived in Wisps of floral-printed chiffon with tiny buttons left undone over lacy bits of lingerie paraded down the runway on glossy black cowboy booties beguiling in their offhandedness  David Hamiltons photography was on Serafinis mood board and like the famous lensman this designer idealizes the young A cropped crocheted sweater worn with hip-slung chambray trousers exposed acres of midriff broderie anglaise bloomers did the same for upper thighs Those shorts might get an airing at Fashion Week a year from now but otherwise theyre a nonstarter Elsewhere a cowhide leather coat seemed like a too-obvious nod to Serafinis Western theme As he settles into his new role hell learn to avoid that kind of runway pratfall Serafinis promise lies in his easy way with a silk dress from a pale mint drop-waist style to the lace inset slips and nightshirts with shorter-in-front and longer-in-back hems that ended the show Extrapolate on numbers like that and keep at the crafty knits he paired with them and hell be onto something$$Brava Phoebe English At her presentation today the up-and-coming designer began in earnest to deliver on her tremendous potential This was Englishs most fully fleshed-out collection to date filled with varied wearable pieces that expressed her distinctively dreamy point of view Displacement was the theme here imparted in everything from the askew cut of a simple camisole to the stutter effect of the three-layered pieces of fabric on the front of a flax-canvas sleeveless jacket English often talks about wanting her clothes to have a sense of immediacy a feeling she conveys via techniques that can come off as naive That sleeveless jacket though was one of the garments here that betrayed her sophistication as a designer The jacket was tailored through the back and the topmost piece of fabric layered in the front had a nattily finished blazer pocket Lots of designers play with deconstruction English was genuinely deconstructing Details like that jacket pocket werent the first things that jumped out at you about Englishs new clothes There was of course the signature handfuls of tulle that English applied to create her gauzy effects there were also sui generis embellishments like the rope-draped velvet frills that looked not unappealingly like scrunchies And English introduced some intriguing new textures here such as string embroidery and a material made by re-weaving torn-up strands of silk The re-woven silk pieces were a highlight of the collectionthe fabric itself was beautiful and English added to its expressiveness by leaving the ends of the silk ribbon dangling to create an irregular fringe The real development here though was in the collections accessibility Another highlight of this outing were the matter-of-fact culottes slashed on both legs near the hem The gesture of the slash sufficed to announce Englishs presence in the garment but you could easily imagine it as a mix-and-match go-to piece in a cool girls closet Ditto the slip-like silk skirts and those nicely askew camisoles English has gone a long way this season toward figuring out how to diffuse her voice through the kinds of items that make a wardrobe Expect more and better to come Thats not a lesson designers unlearn$$For the launch of Piazza Sempiones Spring collection the label again embraced a collaboration with the art world tapping R di Martino a talented Italian video artist whose emotional yet elegant visual language has been widely acclaimed She was commissioned to make a short film called A Day of Wonder shot in Marrakech and inspired by the cult movie Cat People a 1942 film noir depicting an exotic atmosphere full of danger and mystery Di Martino captured the sensuality of a lush Moroccan walled garden where a beautiful woman was lounging poolside Obviously she was clad in a Piazza Sempione cotton kaftanwhich she ditched pronto when after fluctuating lazily between dreams and reality and upon hearing a terrifying roar she jumped hurriedly into the pool for safety There she was surrounded by a surreal play of lights reflected on the water like a deceitful net The finale revealed the illusory nature of her fearsas well as the Moroccan inspiration of a collection which in an abundant stream ofreferences also mentioned a novel by the Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun Ideas from North African garb were translated into clean lines and comfortable shapes in a lineup where tunics capes and elongated dresses had an easy casual feel yet were elegant in their fluid simplicity Colors were warm and natural micro geometric patterns were inspired by zelliges the traditional colorful tiles adorning the walls of mosques and palaces They also served as the starting point for the digital work of artist Najia Mehadji whose pulsating images of flowers were reworked on printed silk poplin and duchesse$$Everyone says that the fashion business is changing For this reporters money the best evidence of the week so far came at Polo Ralph Laurens rooftop presentation where Selena Gomez (435 million Instagram followers) and Brooklyn Beckham (42 millionnot bad for a celebrity offspring) took in the tableaux vivant side by side Considering the access to all the eyeballs that millennial celebrities can provide a brand a journalist cant help but wonder if her kinds days are numbered  While I still have your attention a thought on the company and its new Spring collection Nobody knows their own brand better than Ralph Lauren knows his One season fashion leans minimal the next it sways vintage nerd-chic but Polos all-American style is eternal Exiting the stairwell into the bright sunshine of The McKittrick Hotels Gallow Green Gomez and Beckham were greeted by a denim grouping which produced two of the afternoons strongest looks a faded jumpsuit with metal hardware that was as slouchy as a three-piece denim suit was slim Section two had a Western flavor Fringe may be absolutely everywhere at the moment but let the record stand Lauren got there first  Group three is where Lauren turned on the brights tying the sleeves of a fuchsia cable-knit crew around the shoulders of a coral red minidress layering an electric orange schoolgirl blazer over a Bengal-stripe shirtdress and reuniting that definitive preppy combination of pink and green on a linen blazer and skinny jeans Floral-print sundresses were accessorized with floral-print bags of many different shapes and sizes By comparison the guys khaki suiting came off staid Classic isnt a bad thing when it comes to menswear but for the preppy peacock Lauren had a vibrant red firemans jacket$$Natasa Cagalj is a designer who believes in allowing her experiences as a woman a mother and a friend to other women to inform the way she designs The ideas for the collection she put together for Spring started she relatedwhile pulling out an oversize poplin top printed with circles and flowerswhen she was on the beach in Croatia this summer These are the simple potato prints my children made on holiday she said Im half Croatian half Slovenian and used to spend four weeks on the beach every year in Croatia as a girlI always used to bring ribbons and tape and paper and paints with me to make things just to stop myself being bored She smiled So now its a family tradition that me and my sister and all our children always do the same thing every year The sense of a lifestyle craftiness and do-it-yourself resourcefulness ran through the collection which was based around building a wardrobe of pinstriped shirting pieces pants knitwear soft tailoring and dresses Cagalj whose studio is in London says shed like to take the stress out of dressing for busy women who have work family and business travel to contend with I had this thought of how nice it would be to go to bed in your hotel room in your pajamas and bathrobe and maybe just get up and go out in them How many fashion women in a zombie state of tiredness at the shows will relate to that$$When a 79 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 of this year Kathmandu-raised Prabal Gurung mobilized quickly using his social media platforms to call for donations Since then about a million dollars have been raised for the quakes victims by the Shikshya Foundation Nepal on the board of which he sits Backstage tonight he was feeling gratitude If it wasnt for the fashion industry I wouldnt have been able to do it His show started with a thank-you some 30 monks clad in their traditional red and yellow robes hands clasped in prayer chanting The collection too had its roots in Nepal The work of artist Laxman Shreshtha who Gurung said he grew up studying became a jacquard on skin-baring evening separates the orange and yellow Holi powder hues of which formed the shows warm lit-from-within palette Last season Gurung took a turn for the minimal and he was on a similar path for Spring Simple pieces like a bias-cut chiffon column in pale yellow or a sleeveless black-and-white guipure lace sheath were the ones that resonated Gurung has a tendency to overembellish from time to timea printed dress with a skin-baring hand-tacked seam at the waist and another dress with a cluster of cutouts below its plunging neckline were two looks that wouldve benefited from a little more restraint By the end however he was in his groove The trio of body-skimming brightly colored finale gowns were stripped of all the extras They looked sensational$$Subverting traditional classics That was the line transmitted about the Prada collection by design director Fabio Zambernardi backstage in the absence of Miuccia Prada who was sadly unable to be there this season due to the passing of her aunt If Miuccia was elsewhere her aesthetic was fully present in a collection which literally stayed within narrow lines It was an essay on skirt suits and coats bisected with a graphic theme of vertical stripes and accompanied by a wealth of her quirky accessories signature embellishments and the swish of dozens of dangly earrings as big as Christmas-tree baubles The news from Milan so far has been about retro-eclecticism drawn through an Italian sensibility Well if anyone is the mother of all that it's Miuccia Prada who has been writing the encyclopedia on it with PhD-level footnotes and wittily allusive fashion-changing asides for decades This collection trod firmly on her home territory shod in an array of elegant low-heeled shoes each pair made in its own delicious configuration of pointiness ankle-strapping metallic leather patent and suede As for the suits they came in collages of checks tweeds and stripes sometimes in leather and suede here and there in transparent prints What to make of this For one thing Miuccia Prada pays no heed to weather-appropriateness In her viewwhich is a global onetheres as much need for pieced fur coats in summer as there is for skimpy silk slip dresses which she optionally layers over chunky knits Theres the question of proportions tooher loosened shoulder line and boxy shapes and a series of waist-length jackets in brown suede and leather could well prove influential The show ended with a siren call to Pradas wealthiest constituencies coats in metallic snakeskin and suede stripes and beautifully desirable organza suits and coats decorated with outsize transparent pailletted flowers One way or another all those looks are destined to be broken down and distributed as trophies all over the realms of young Hollywood the art world weddings and special occasions that Miuccia Prada knows so well$$Forecast Next summer will be about prettiness romance ruffles and laceor at least it will be for the portion of female humanity whos naturally into that But what if youre not Preen by Thornton Bregazzi is a collection that might meet you halfway Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi are a couple who know how to put an English edge on a ruffle and a flash of sex in a fluttery print frock Not surprising Theyre based in Notting Hill and started their business in the 90s in a concrete bunker under the overpass on Portobello Road Versed in the history of subversive alternatives as they are they can easily turn their hands to punk-ifying a Princess Diana Shy Di blouse with a couple of D-rings and straps or making that whole yoke and frill shape in startlingly erotic sheer black lace Thornton and Bregazzi said theyd been looking at contemporary dance particularly at Michael Clark and wanted a sense of beautiful romance in the collection The opening dress a dusty pink with sprigged flowers and a falling-off-shoulder line captured that fluidity of movement in a Stevie Nicks sort of waya trend thats continuing since the New York shows Then came a lot of slim lace dresses layered over short skirts which had cutout patches on the sleeves that had been re-appliqud with guipure flowers If they slightly trod on territory Christopher Kane mapped out at the beginning of his career and other moments brought back memories of some of Nicolas Ghesquires Balenciaga collections thats only a quibble Otherwise it was as always a confident showing of what their audience likes best$$A Georgian townhouse on Fitzroy Square was the serene setting for the first showing of Preen Lines Spring 2016 collection It was a chance for the designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi to indulge their magpie spirit with a series of vintage-inspired pieces that had their frequent stomping ground Portobello Market at heart Rainbows and flowers in satin stitch embroidery with more than a hint of the Haight-Ashbury hippie nodded to the 70s needlework of Ossie Clark It crept across the sleeves of a white double pleat denim jacket and onto a series of seriously desirable two-tone suede pieces that included a belted shirtdress and button-front A-line skirt Preen-staple floaty dresses were amplified with acidic yellow and pink checks on chiffon and stretch drill fabrics that hit a hard-edged punky note Once again the joy of Preen Line was in its ability to pull elements from countercultures and transform them into the kind of everyday essentials that smart hardworking woman want and need There was much for them to choose from in this sprawling 70-piece collection which overall was an altogether softer proposition than Fall though the graphic stripes that featured so heavily that season also found their way onto cropped sweatshirts and monochrome tank tops here A standout was the zigzag sweater which injected some much-needed West London glam into this quiet corner of Bloomsbury$$Although Massimo Nicosias press notes quoted him as saying this collection reflects an ethereal holiday in Scotland it would be highly inadvisable to pack these clothes for a real vacation in Braveheart territory Because seriously If you didn't freeze to death the midges would eat you alive That trifling quibble apart this was an often-lovely highly shootable potpourri of technically impressive work Nicosia is a percolator a thinker and this season he was trying to step back behind Pringle of Scotland's thick-knit lambswool curtain into more elemental territory The deep-V punched argyle intarsia in the debut look pointed to the rustication and sublimation ahead Rubberized string and leather tape were the fronds that twined below faux-naif floral details pinned to the chest and hip of faux-crochet (faux-chet) loose woven dresses Sliced panels of silk in diamond formation were more argyle salutations whilst the fishing-net open stitching was Nicosia's nod to the installation pieces of artist Ernesto Neto All this carefully wrought through-a-prism primitivism worked pragmatically in the net bags and stitched sandals To further entangle this collection's complicatedly knotted self-referential pitch at distillation that orange stitching was in fact digitally printeda computer-realized simulacrum of an artisan technique$$The things you hear backstage Tonight at Proenza Schouler Lazaro Hernandez declared We were looking at bananas things that peel away from the body The designer and his partner Jack McCollough turned out an audacious collection for Spring one that solidified their recent preoccupations with texture decoration and asymmetry and produced some of the most knockout dresses of the week Spain seemed to be a starting point what with the black white and red color palette the ruffles and the exposed shoulders and the pom-poms that traced the edges of dresses and jackets in broderie anglaise But this wasnt the straightforward interpretation of Spanish influences that Peter Coppings was at Oscar de la Renta last night Two shirtdresses that spilled off the shoulders (fashions current favorite erogenous zone) turned to reveal a crisscross of straps the hem of another dress was connected via a series of tied knots and the back was cut out of a knit dress with flamenco ruffles Tailored pieces were stripped of their closures velvet ribbons that looped through metal grommets and tied in bows kept patch-worked jacquard jackets and vests from falling open All of which brings us back to Hernandezs peeling bananas The Proenza boys have long been New York Citys most craft-obsessed young designers With a new investor announced earlier this year their ambitions are bigger than ever Here and there the details were overdoneseen all together those bows surely looked too busy But when they were on they were on Tops in our books was a series of narrow midi dresses with ruffles cutouts and fil coupe dots Feathered numbers made by shooting a rod through each quill to create a mesh grid were truly special As for accessories the pointy-toed mules with metal ring detailing lacing at the ankles and low mirrored heels rank right up there with the best of New York City too$$Creative director Kate Wendelborn may have recently left Protagonist but Spring found the hyper-soign label born of The Line in fighting form albeit with a slightly more conservative tenor The studio team hewed close to its aesthetic foundations clean lines immaculate fabrications and unfussy luxury The latter was paramount for Spring straight out of the gate to wit a spare robe coat in buttery suede andwait for ita chocolate croc bolero A piece like that might easily feel anachronistic downright patrician even but in the closet of the Protagonist woman (sitting as it no doubt does alongside tattered 501s and white tees) it reads as a serious statement Itll team dreamily with one of this seasons lookbook shoe stylesBirks  la Blahnik good enough to make you pray theyll make it into production Their androgynous appeal was echoed in rakish pajama tops which borrowed a classic mens shape and added a simple tie to cinch the waist  A grouping of straightforward black nylon jackets came up strong on utilitarianism still theyd hardly have been missed within this generally singular lineup Shirting an emphasis for the brand from day one was as covetable as ever with pieces alternately crisp and louche with wide cuffs or with shawl collars and delicate button detailing Those closures were equally effective on a slit-to-there pencil skirt which was risqu without being showy and evocative to boot$$The pressures on for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne The Public School designers unveil their debut collection for DKNY in a few days time and it was reasonable to expect that the duos need to deliver for their new corporate masters would result in a Public School show that looked well distracted Instead Chow and Osbornes DKNY assignment seems to have prompted them to think even harder about Public School and how to bring the brands clothes a real sense of elevation A sophisticated tone was set with the first pair of looks two streetwise yet soign ensembles that featured terrific softly pleated palazzo pants Here at last was the payoff for all the effort Chow and Osborne have put in the past few seasons to bring more dimension and fluidity to their womens looks And indeed the highlights of this collection found them exploring dimension and fluidity with a fresh sense of fluency Those qualities were there in spades in for instance a chic belted gilet of sand-toned raffia multiple parachute-inspired coats and the silky maxi dresses that read as a sporty take on that lean Haider Ackermann silhouette The latter looks didnt read as derivative They did however feel grown up Chow and Osborne said after the show that they were imagining the Public School girl gone abroad on far-flung travels seeking to find herself Thats a grab bag of a concept one that invites a lot of drift and where Chow and Osborne faltered here was in the looks that digressed from the collections overarching urban-nomad vibe A tennis sweateresque knit dress for instance seemed out of sync with the rest of the show ditto the sculpted wrap skirts and button-downs with graphic contrast piping The designers werent wrong to want to interrupt the parade of diaphanous looks with something a little sharper but they did that to better effect when they introduced say slender ribbed tunics with tonal horizontal stripes Those pieces expressed the signature Public School geometry but elegantly and with understatement If thats what comes of turning up the pressure on Osborne and Chowbring it on$$Was a new Wes Anderson flick filming at The Plaza Hotel this morning No it was just that Rachel Antonoff had taken over The Plazas storied Palm Court to stage her labels fantastical Spring presentation A branch structure encircled the rooms central bar and the plush carpets were strewn with torn paper pinecones Coleman lamps and the like All around were exquisite 3-D paper birds With a theme of birding Antonoff envisioned the seasons protagonist Edith Finch a slightly dotty (if not downright deranged) woman We dont know if its all in her head Antonoff offered She might be the only person at camp There was also a dose of Troop Beverly Hills The set was an ultra-involved imagining of what the Womens Aviary Society Annual Birding Weekend might look like In keeping with the quietly sinister undertone models posed casually with say an ax (more Misery than Troop BH) or a bow and arrow Whats more one of those paper birds came shot bleeding tiny crimson paper droplets There were sweet Carmen Mirandaesque fruit prints itty-bitty cropped novelty T-shirts (Tiny Tee read a particularly meta one) and 50s-style frocks The camp/birding themes hit their zenith in the counselor get-upskhaki colored with all manner of ornithological flair The chickadee patches were darling but there was an authoritarian dowdiness to those pieces that may make them a tough sell for Antonoffs clientele What theyll go gaga for is the pure 90s slip dress in a candy-colored pastel floral jacquard and the eyelet column gown$$This was a watershed moment Tonights Rachel Comey dinner-cum-show at Pioneer Works in Red Hook unfolded a little differently than ones past As opposed to filing out in a series of looks between courses Comeys models came out once this evening en masse And most of them werent models at least not in the sense that the term is usually understood These were dancers of varying ages colors and sizes from the robbinschilds company with which Comey collaborated on a video presentation for Resort They were fitted in characteristically easy-going looks that suited each womans shape and as they took their leisurely turns down the ersatz runway between the dinner tables they asserted an aura of self-possession and authority The dancers looked like interesting stylish women you might encounter on the street That was Comeys point of courseto validate the reality of her clothes rather than setting them up as a fantasy that potential customers might wish to enter into Many people in the audience said afterwards that they were moved It seems a bit glib after that coup de thetre to talk about individual pieces But Comeys collection did underscore her themethe emphasis was on fabrics that felt soft and looked lived in experienced somehow To wit the stonewashed velvet that Comey used in slouchy suits and one excellent duster-length trench and the vegetable-dyed leathers and emphatically distressed denim A sense of things being in process pervaded the collections shapes as well These were fitted closer to the body in general than Comey is usually wont to do but they frequently featured dangling scarf-like hems or other kinds of asymmetries to create dimension and dynamism There were standout pieces alongside that velvet trench and sundry details worth calling out but they all served Comeys larger point which was to validate the fact that these clothes were made for living Which is a thing that real interesting women do$$After a turning point for Rachel Zoes eponymous line back in Resort you hoped the designer and her team would be able to keep up their momentum in reviving the formerly fatigued label And at yesterday's presentation they generally succeeded At the risk of sounding like a broken record in characterizing the mega-stylists design sensibilities her woman doesnt vary too much from season to season even if the locale does periodically (Morocco or Carnaby Street) gypset luxe with a Bianca Jaggeresque ratio of uptown polish and downtown bohemia Zoes clothes continue to take on a more aspirational quality Spring's tasseled suede topper felt a long way from the parade of filmy pussy-bow blouses from seasons gone by There was a sense of luxury to it and to pieces like a beaded and fringed vest in cream-color upholstery or the tasseled suede toppers The designers suiting meanwhile was more compelling than ever before Opulently slouchy pajama styles stole even the heart of this Fashion Weekweary reporter A few looks felt superfluous the diaphanous yellow maxi dress was surely nice and shoppable but perhaps not distinctive enough to warrant its place in the runway edit Nevertheless this collection was another savvy step in the reinvigoration of the Rachel Zoe brand$$Did it make any difference that Rag & Bone decided to show in Brooklyn Not in the sense of having any material effect on the pictures you see here in which the background and lighting are indistinguishable from any other professional production in New York Yet theres a yearning among many designers now to get back to some feeling of authenticityor rather any feeling at all that takes people out of the usual show rut And in the case of Rag & Bone designers David Neville and Marcus Wainwright that meant deciding to invite their audience to partake of something privately meaningful to them on both the local and the stylistic levels to wit a collection that re-channeled the 90s of the designers youth and in a community arts center St Anns Warehouse which they both revere as a stage graced by Lou Reed and other members of the Velvet Underground generation A swift read out in terms of clothes revealed slightly different reference points though Backstage Wainwright said that the midi tube dresses and hoop earrings were derived from his memories of going to the Notting Hill Carnival in London in the late 90s and all the army-surplus references to MA-1 jackets parkas and ribbed sweaters came from the huge collection of military clothes Ive had since before we even began this thing Add in some slip dresses technorave sportswear mesh and track pants and there you have it The truth is that the Rag & Bone guys are of course English They came to the United States and made it on a commercial scale which would never have been possible on British resources in such quick order Now Wainwright is so deeply embedded in New York that he sees Brooklyn where he lives as home Inviting his audience to drive out to visit his adopted neighborhood at nine at night was no big ask in his mind but more of an act of solidarity with a community Giving back is always good$$USRL 1967 the patch on a white shirt announced Jessica Chastain Julianne Moore and the rest of us were transported oceanside at Ralph Laurens show this morning To use a maritime expression the designer found his sea legs for Spring Accessories ranged from captains hats to souvenir straw bags to the sort of cork platforms you see in resort towns As for the clothes they hewed to the RL standards preppy yacht-clubbing essentials in a vivid all-American color palette and cable sweaters draped over shoulders or wrapped around waists Amid the large offering of navy and tan leather jackets there was at least one of his de rigueur double-breasted blazers The seafaring theme was particularly hard to miss in a series of looks in a super-bold geometric sail print This was one of Laurens most literal-minded collections in some time but if the designer and his styling team mightve used a lighter touch to convey the seasons crisp sporty message piece by piece there were great clothes A color-blocked sleeveless jumpsuit had the graphic punch of nautical flags Clingy knit dresses that took cues from athletic swimsuits looked like theyd be fun to wearin particular the evening versions with their sexy strappy backs And who doesnt love a striped knit Speaking of stripes the stars of the show were the evening dresses in cotton broadcloth shirting fabric haute silhouettes in a humble fabric$$Whos Raquel Allegras biggest fan Judging from the designers New York Fashion Week debut a whole lot of women Thursdays presentation drew a buzzing crowd and women from top boutique buyers to a radiant Marisa Tomei grabbed her for selfies Despite years of showing her collections only on an appointment basis Allegra is a well-established presence in the industry and yesterday was vivid testimony to that fact Allegras work has always been heavily marked by the bohemian and Spring found her embracing it wholly Models stood at the edges of a floral mandala created by close friends of the designer and a psychedelic soundtrack (the 13th Floor Elevators anyone) was piped in over the system  Recent seasons have found the designer expanding her purview integrating other materials into her signature vernacular of supple jersey denim lace leathereven some rabbit fur for Resort Likewise there was a lot of newness to be had here floral separates and dresses in a more conspicuously print-y print than shes shown in past something for the guys (a Spring mens capsule will be available exclusively at Barneys) and wait for itfootwear Coolest were a pair of leather slip-ons that Allegra dubbed the baby of a creeper and a ballet flat In a lot of ways that was an apt description for the seasons offering on the whole Allegras got an evident romantics soul but some of the best pieces here were the ones that spoke to a punkier edge and pushed her established boundaries a bit Take the sheer layering pieces in her trademark cobwebby shredding or a short-sleeved fringe leather jacket shown with a top and wide-leg trouser in a murky green and black stripe She may be a big proponent of oversized pieces but Allegra surely knows her way around great soft tailoring$$One gets the feeling that Rebecca Minkoffs customer might be most familiar with the designers seasonal muses from say a Pinterest board Still if Minkoff can turn on her young clientele to the likes of Patti Smith or Franoise Hardy as some of the icons she's envisioned through her kicky clothes more power to her For Spring the inspiration was Marianne Faithfull whom Minkoff discussed backstage in terms of both her sweetness and her rebelliousness The designer nodded to that duality with her color story opening the collection with a parade of virginal ivory cream and bone which soon gave way to plenty of black The Minkoff girl at her baddest (and coolest) came in an homage to Faithfull as seen in The Girl on a Motorcycle a lightened-up take on the black leather jumpsuit she wears in the film Shapes here were a mishmash of the Mod (a sweet suede shift) and the bohemian (maxi tank dresses with a nice flyaway sleeve detail) The hemlines were short and the designers footwear of choicea pared-back knee-high gladiator with colored Lucite heelscame up long on appeal$$One reason Rebecca Taylor is a highlight among contemporary designers is that she trusts her instincts Rather than reinterpret last seasons trends or cobble together an obscure reference she taps into what women are craving whether its a Victorian neckline or something less defined like a freer more experimental approach to getting dressed For Spring she was feeling midi lengths baby boot-cut pants and less volume overalldetails that feel right this season but you cant quite put your finger on why A-line skirts skimmed the hips before gently flaring out and off-the-shoulder dresses with big ruffles flattered the arms they were the kind of pieces that draw you to the rack because theyre pretty not because they reference a particular decade or mood  Taylor is known for her eccentric feminine prints and this season she indulged her love of the Bloomsbury Group a collective of English artists philosophers and writers from the early 1900s She flipped through a heavy coffee-table book and pointed out paintings and drawings that were mirrored in the collections rich florals Several looks had different prints patchworked together as if she couldnt choose a favorite a V-neck ankle-length dress with capped sleeves was a real standout$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli swapped Seattle for the Petit Trianon this season And given the designers penchant for embroideries and point desprit Marie Antoinette proved to be a much more natural inspiration than Kurt and Courtney While Falls grunge references came off somewhat literallywho looks to Red Valentino for a lumberjack shirt after allthese riffs on eighteenth-century styling seemed more subtle Take the ruffled corsetry which lent a new insouciant charm to the jumpsuit a popular silhouette that has been in need of a refresh Since taking the reins at this label Chiuri and Piccioli have made all things A-line their signature The hourglass corsets count as genuine news for the duoreason enough to give this little sister line a closer look for Spring The real stars of the collection though were the cap-sleeve slightly empire-line dresses in delicate layers of lace hand-embroidered with wildflowers or beaded here and there with small birds We expect to see Hollywoods young royals in them all awards season long$$Reem Acra a Lebanon native wanted to show who she was in this collection by combining her past and present life Acra tied the two together quite literally by using the belt as a jumping-off point I was going to flea markets all over the world and collecting belts off of people she said The accessories had intricate nods to traditional Middle Eastern beading and were embedded into short dresses highlighting the midsection for a nice bloom-at-the-waist emphasis The detail became a figure-complementing necessity with pieces like a floral-print V-neck dress with a tulle overlay that cascaded over the shoulders as well as an orange scoop-neck shirt paired with a twisted aqua skirt While most of the belts seemed plucked straight from a bazaar in Beirut not everything was quite as homage paying There was an almost bohemian through-the-looking-glass version that was common in the 60s That factor came through in a metallic-whipped dress with poet sleeves patterned with paisleys doused in a groovy palette of lime greens lavenders and pinks A strappy thigh-skimming chiffon dress was slathered in midnight blue sequins and had dcolletage that dipped into the waist  But it was the floor-skimming gowns that were Acras strong point and they fully exemplified her meticulous attention to detailthose were full of far-flung romantic flou A crimson robe dress secured with a metal-looking clasp belt had strips of emerald beading that lined the opening eventually curving around the neck for a sliver of sex appeal while a caftan gown with gold edging and bright red embroidered florals injected a dose of modesty Both versions would be nice to see on the red carpet this coming awards season$$Its easy to think about fashion at the surface level What makes us feel comfortable beautiful powerful sexy Most people dont go beyond that to consider how the current state of culture affects their wardrobes but it plays a big part in what we buy Rie Yamagata for example doesnt approach design with a specific theme or dramatic twist in mind she just wants to make clothes that cool girls would wear in New York City Tokyo and everywhere in between She thinks about what women crave and more importantly why we crave it Her starting point for Spring 2016 was the Southwest but she couldnt quite put her finger on how she got there I think with all the technology happening right now I just wanted everything to feel natural she said We used a lot of natural silks that feel so good against the body I didnt want to use many synthetics  Words like crafty and artisanal were thrown around the presentation space a lot You could think of them as the inverse of selfie and wearable tech A cream silk georgette gown with black trim had the potential to be the perfect one-step summer party uniform while nubby jacquard jackets and skirts with unfinished hems lent a bit more structure Even the prints felt just slightly undonea poppy floral was vaguely surreal on a wide-leg jumpsuit and a few silk dresses featured a blown-up pixel weave print that mimicked fuzzy plaid and houndstooth But one of the simplest pieces managed to sum up the collection best A sleek ivory column with a hand-knotted macram placket was equally suited for day and night and nailed that easy yet special balance that feels so fresh right now$$In a recent interview actress Carey Mulligan complained about the fact that the characters she plays are often described as strong women That label she said makes it seem as though strength in a woman is the exception not the norm And it rubs her the wrong way Its not uncommon to experience a similar frisson backstage at a fashion show when a designer says that his (or her) collection pays tribute to strong womenthe message is always well meant but by setting up strength as a quality found only in a particular type of woman it demeans the fairer sex as a whole At his latest show Rick Owens put paid to that way of thinking Owens latest coup de thtre wasnt a tribute to strong women it was a tribute to female strength Thats a major distinction Chanteuse Eska who performed last year with Owenss wife Michle Lamy at the Meltdown Festival in London presided over this evenings proceedings singing the theme song from the film Exodus As she sang models exited in new Rick Owens lookssome of which like the sleeveless dusters and crinkled anoraks registered as atypically accessible silhouettes while others such as the short dresses collaged from canvas and leather reiterated Owenss signature sculptularity in a new almost dreamlike tone Periodically the dfil was interrupted by an incredible sight a woman dressed by Owens carrying another woman down the long length of the runway Their bodies were yoked together sometimes the women being carried hung upside down legs slung over their partners shoulders Other women were strapped on like backpacks Speaking before the show Owens said hed been thinkingwondering reallyabout the ways women nurture others metaphorically taking on another human beings weight That inquiry was communicated forcefully by the shows staging The carrying women with their human freight also suggested the physical labors of pregnancyan undercurrent amplified by the Owens silhouettes featuring distended volumes that were almost carbuncular When the last model crossed the catwalk wearing a short dress and one of those terrifically commercial crinkled anoraks she looked sublimely unburdeneduntil you noted the straps crisscrossing the jacket in back Even the most sylph-like seemingly footloose and fancy-free woman is prepared at any moment to shoulder a weight That at any rate appeared to be Owenss message in making those load-bearing straps his shows closing image All women are strong Even the ones who dont know it yet$$Peter Dundas has a reputation as a classy designer In his varied career hes proven his talents at Emanuel Ungaro (doing haute Parisian) Revillon (fur) and Emilio Pucci (sexy rock-chick dressing) Now Dundas has circled back to Roberto Cavalli the house where he began his careerand where incidentally Balmains Olivier Rousteing was once his assistant Over the past couple of years the competition among labels to capture the imagination of a new generation has resulted in a remarkable changing of the guard The domino effect started with Hedi Slimanes democratizing youth-cult-y success at Saint Laurent it flowed on through Alessandro Micheles eclectic vintage-y takeover at Gucci and most recently it hit New York putting Public School in charge at DKNY For his Cavalli comeback Dundas has handled the commercial situation by sidestepping the haute and embracing street and nightclub-wear with an 80s spin The result skimpy body-con dresses high-waisted animal-print jeans and leggings sleeveless biker jackets bandeau tops tied in pouf-y bows on one shoulder and prom skirts trailing giant frilled trains in their wake There is nothing wrong with tinkering with 80s styling per seMiuccia Prada Jonathan Anderson and Christopher Kane are all dab hands at playing with Princess Di yoked collars pumped-up Gloria von Thurn und Taxis leg-of-mutton sleeves and jangling Christian Lacroix-meets-Memphis color and pattern Theres a fine line of irony though which divides the intriguingly kitsch from the literal and cheap looking Dundas was on sure ground when he tailored leather into neat jackets and sexy pants these showed his long-standing expertise as a cutter and fitter for beautiful young girls bent on having a good time But Dundas still needs to find that difficult balance between accessibility and designer leadership He has all the talent and experience it takes and a huge swath of friends and goodwill following him His track record suggests that by next season hell have it figured out$$Gala Dal wife of Salvador was Alessandro DellAcquas muse for Spring Shes a fitting inspiration for the designer who has imbued his version of Rochas with whimsy and hyperbole Both were in evidence in his new Spring collection which featured torso-spanning bows beaded giraffe embroideries and shiny retro bras and briefs (patent plastic) underneath lace dresses And that was just DellAcqua getting stared There were also jailhouse stripes on a pinafore dress an Alessandro Michele for Gucci pantsuit moment and anachronistic graphic tees layered under clouds of white organza Not unlike his No 21 collection in Milan last week this Rochas outing strained under the weight of all DellAcquas ideas Thats too bad because there were gems in the mix like the loose-fitting slip dresses he cut in several different fabrics prettiest of all a colorful jacquard over which he layered delicate black Chantilly lace A quick scan of the top e-commerce sites suggests DellAcquas Rochas is a popular label but the buys tend to be significantly more conservative than what he showed on the runway today Among the things that made it to the catwalk that were sure to see online are the eccentric but easy-on-the-feet lace skimmers$$Sometimes I feel like its futuristic to go into the past Sometimes fashion quotes like that one from Kate Mulleavy seem to make little sensebut what she was talking about after the beautifully feminine Rodarte show was the powerful effect of taking time to read poetry and then seeing how it works on your creativity She and her sister Laura spent the summer immersing themselves in Elizabeth Barrett Browning Emily Dickinson and Leonard Cohen while listening to Electric Light Orchestras early synthesized sparkly music It seems to have put them into a kind of a 70s-nostalgic trance from which their best collection in a long time proceededa kind of soft glam-rock tenderly sewn into immensely intricate lace dresses trailing long silk scarves and an aura of Old Hollywood glitter in its wake Whatever therapy reading poetry offers the soul it seems to have refocused the Mulleavys on what they do best and believe in most giving them the heart to fully concentrate on the art of dressmaking which has always been at their fingertips but has at times drifted from their grasp in the crosscurrents of other pop-cultural seasonal notions This time though their promise was realized in a head-spinningly light and complex series of collages of lace velvet embroidery beading and silk fringing cut into Victoriana bodices and swinging gently out from small waists to touch the knee Such lavish techniques can easily lead to heaviness or a sense of inauthentic costumey-ness but this was a fully realized and believable fashion look Down to the black lacy tights down to the truly enviable gold silver and colored suede Deco shoes it read as a young womans interpretation of what it might take to have a really good night out on the town non-uptight dressing for maybe dancing and lounging languidly around on couches who knows where It wasnt all dresses either What with the floppily louche lam pantsuits big shearling chubbies and some sexy bugle-beaded miniskirts with flower appliqus curving dangerously upward in the front this was a collection that achieved the range that has also eluded the Mulleavys till now Did it move fashion on Probably not But as far as Rodarte is concerned looking to its own past brought out what will stick in memory as one of the most soulfully authentic collections in New York$$Since moving to New York City from Sweden Carin Rodebjer has like many of her fellow city-dwellers developed an obsession with space Not outer spacethat was the theme of Rodebjers fine Fall 2015 collectionbut space in general and having enough of it to move around in This season she translated the obsession into clothes that emphasized movement The theme was iterated in various waysdiaphanous silk dresses kimono-shaped jackets and blouses culottes made for a long stride Eyelash fringe underscored the collections sense of motion as well as adding to its rich sense of texture so did fabrics like a white silk dappled in silver meant to catch and throw back the light  Silhouettes erred toward the long and the lean but never so much that the looks came off as in any way constrictive and the languid tone was echoed in the palette which moved through rustic earth tones to oceanic blues There was an element of pop however The monochromatic collage prints in sandwashed silk were designed by Rodebjers longtime friend the artist Liselotte Watkins The prints geometries though soft helped to provide the clothes with a sense of urbanity one characteristic of Rodebjers oeuvre For all its vacation-y ease this was a city-dwellers collection after all$$Geometric sculptures dotted the runway like jigsaw puzzles at Roksanda Ilincics show this morning giving clues to her new collection Cutouts and asymmetry have been recurring themes on the runways this season and the designer was thinking along those lines for Spring too The show opened with one of her signature floor-length A-line dresses which was covered with an Abstract Expressionistinspired pattern but first signs of a more off-center approach came through in a ruffle that snaked along the leg of cropped trousers That idea reappeared in more recognizable puzzle-like pieces such as in a sweeping canary yellow and black dress that was cut with keyhole peepholes Those somewhat tricky experiments in proportion made way for a more fluid silhouette and the simpler slip dresses in shades of blush baby blue yellow and black were the most convincing looks hereand right in line with the softer romantic mood of the season With her mille-feuille shredded chiffon dresses that closed the show Ilincic took her voluminous aesthetic in an interesting new direction It would likely require a statuesque beauty like Ilincic herself though to pull them off on the red carpet$$Roland Mourets Galaxy dress turns 10 this year There have been times during the last decade when Mouret has worked hard to distance himself from that sublime frock even as the media has never let him forget about it Today he made a celebration of it sending the models out for their finale in a rainbow coalition of Galaxy dresses to the delight of the crowd Designers feel untold pressure to innovateMouret includedand in the endless quest for something new hes occasionally made dresses too complicated for their own good with origami-like nipping and tucking at the waistline The patternmaking has been fairly virtuosic and the hourglass fit sexy yet the finished product has at times felt overwrought Mouret avoided that mistake here opting to explore color and print rather than fabric manipulation and fixating on the shoulders as a new erogenous zone In keeping with one of the major trends of the season there were a handful of cold shoulder dresses but he made a point of variety also showing a crisscrossing spaghetti-strap cocktail dress a fluttery black halter top that descended into a midi-length white skirt and one-shoulder knits worn with knee-length skirts for a daytime appeal As for that color and pattern Mouret took an inclusive approach offering classic navy on the one hand and bright saffron and mint-green on the other The most innovative print was actually a laser-cut floral motif on a pair of skirts The program notes announced a capsule collection of pieces made in the Galaxy dresss image Theyre already available for sale on the Roland Mouret website We have a feeling theyll be getting lots of clicks tomorrow$$Rosetta Getty stumbled onto her inspiration this season She was at the Getty Center checking out the Jackson Pollocks and happened to notice museum workers installing the show Yvonne Rainer Dances and Films That got her thinking about postmodern danceits expansiveness and its naked expressivenessand about the aesthetics of the dance world in general Getty extrapolated the dance theme pretty directly here and to very appealing effect She emphasized fluid silhouettes that could accommodate movement whether in calf-length skirts and dresses with trumpet silhouettes or fine rib tees with a leotard-like fit or trousers with a pajama sense of ease There were also lots of openings and slits often created via apron-ish ties Wrapping and tying were already idiomatic to Getty but she nicely updated her vocabulary this season The apron-style tunics open at the side and white satin wrap dress piped in black were two particularly strong looks As usual much of the beauty of Gettys collection was to be found in her fabrics For example the crepe she used is you have to believe the very best crepe The excellence of its hand-feel cant really be imparted in words or photos but a glance at Gettys taupe V-neck gown hints at its terrific drape Likewise the cotton poplin she used in her charming flounced off-the-shoulder tops was paradigmatically light and crispy and the georgette of a black cape-sleeved gown was Platonically silky One of Gettys grace notes was her tonal textural adaption in luxe white viscose of the paisley print seen elsewhere in silk Her trousers and wrapped tunic top in the viscose fused pliancy and authority in much the way a top-notch dancer does Getty did her stumbled-on inspiration proud$$Rosie Assoulin is having a good time The bonhomie is self-evident in her clothes which often come off as immaculately crafted surrealist jokes Assoulin isnt as sly or pointed as Elsa Schiaparelli was at least not yet but shes working in the same playful vein This season for instance she traded in the dirigible-size gowns for which shes been known and focused instead on recontextualizing the most casual of wear to wit bathing suits pajamas and underwear The undies were boxers poking out of slouchy twill pants theyd been sewn into the pajama-inspired looks came bedazzled in grids of tiny Swarovski crystals or more slinky yet were executed in iridescent crystal mesh Swimsuits meanwhile offered Assoulin numerous opportunities to have funtriangle tops as daywear candy-color bikini bottom ties as embellishment on a cocktail dress magnified ties cinching the sides of pantsand she parried those riffs with mariner-inspired looks Workingman and vacationing lady meet at the waters edge A romantic comedy by Rosie Assoulin As far as the evening looks went Assoulin didnt entirely jettison her penchant for volume and exaggeration this season but she did rein it way way in There were gowns and long skirts that spread out from the hip in godet pleats and formal tops with Mannerist sleeves But the designer seemed more turned on by the subtler elements here like the snaps that allowed a one-shoulder pink frock to shape-shift if the wearer so desired or those bedazzled crystal grids Assoulin is finding new outlets for her sensibility in other words and relying less on operatic effects Surely Schiap would approve$$Ryan Lo expressed his yen for maximalist cutesiness through a series of treacly-sweet tropes of Valentines schtick anime superheroes and fairy-tale archetypes in this tasty sugar rush of a collection The frills kept coming frolicking up jersey socks trousers and dresses cavorting hither and thither in crema whorls against printed jersey Heaped-on jewelry and lost-in-the-forest mussed-up hair added entirely unnecessary but hey-why-not drama and flash  Acid pick-and-mix intarsia knits with punctuations of knot were the looser sometimes anguish-touched exhalations There were heaps of craft passion aplenty and reams of reference that Los note writer Susie Lau reported featured sweet Kiki from Hayao Miyazakis Kikis Delivery Service and the kawaii witches from Ryans childhood faves Sugar Sugar Rune and Magical DoReMi Harajuku heaven$$Some designers drift from season to season looking for a current mood or muse to propel their vision onward Others like Ryan Roche find that the best way to move their label forward comes by returning to a consistent highly personal aesthetic In Roches case that means a veritable obsession with softness a delicate palette (with a particular fondness for the palest shade of blush) and what can only be called coziness Thats not to say that her clothes arent forward-thinking With her latest collection she continued to marry a finely wrought fashion sensibility with a real commitment to ease As far as starting points the look of nineties minimalism and ballerinas in rehearsal was percolating in Roches minds eye for Spring The overall effect was more languid than you would expect from a dancers working uniform though and a cream robe and slightly oversize ribbed pink sweater would make for luxurious pieces to roll around in on a lazy Sunday afternoon  These days that casual yet luxurious approach to everyday dressing appeals beyond the weekend and Roches laid-back elegance speaks to the way many women want to dress right now That her popular cashmere sweaters came with subtle modern twistsan asymmetric ruffle here a belted waist therewas all the more reason to fall for them (or more specifically wrap up in them) Its been a year since Roche was named a runner-up in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition and its clear from her latest collection that shes headed in the right direction$$Sacais Chitose Abe landed a Nike collaboration earlier this year and her name has come up as a possible candidate for the open creative director job at Balenciaga Wed put her clothes in the top handful of most visible brands on the street style scene and shes become highly influential for other designers So whats the problem Easy Abes level of popularity breeds familiarity and as tempting as it may be to stick with what sells shes also aware that she must move on to maintain the level of enthusiasm and support shes lately enjoyed  Her niche has been the concept of hybrids Abe will combine a sweater and a button-down shirt a tweed blazer with a biker jacket or a kilt with a flowing chiffon skirt For Spring the idea was to push things further Its not only about hybrids but about distortion to get new shape her right-hand man Daisuke Gemma said afterward We worked very hard That much was clear The foundations were familiarvintage shop souvenir scarves bandanas Peruvian blanketsbut where they ended up was somewhere way way beyond basic These were audaciously complex clothes constructed from many layers and with a sense of disarraystraps spilling suggestively off shoulders slashed waistbands falling slack at the hipsintentionally built in  It was chaotic just like Paradise Garage was back in the day (The New York City 80s clubs logo tees appeared here as they did in her mens collection back in June) But it was controlled chaos Abe belongs to an elite group of the most ingenious designers working today The navy and gold floral pieces (not lace she pointed out backstage but embroideries with the negative space laser-cut away) are about to become as ubiquitous as all of the Sacai pieces outside the shows today$$It used to be you could get away with buying one good dress for an entire social season But with the advent of social media notable outfits are made to be documented and sharedmaking the economics of re-wearing garments slightly more problematic for the Instagram set Babi Ahluwalia who along with her husband Sachin founded Sachin & Babi said this year she visited several trade shows and spoke directly to a number of customers who expressed anxiety over re-wearing evening gowns after posting images of their outfit on social media At the same time they told the designer they couldnt justify spending thousands of dollars on a dress theyd wear only once Respecting this new digital landscape the Ahluwalias paid extra attention this season to evening separates that can be mixed and matched Strapless trapeze tops in frothy white eyelet or printed chiffon could be worn with a matching skirt or with pants to create an entirely new look (and entice a few double taps no doubt) The designers were also mindful of the price tag Everything in the collection is under $1000 except a hand-embroidered layer cake of a dress that hovers around $1200 and had enough technical detail to warrant the added cost Those were the most exciting offerings from the brand Less so were the more straightforward cocktail dresses though the couple still found a way to add interest by way of off-the-shoulder necklines and bold abstract floral prints$$Commercially Hedi Slimane has no more to prove with what hes set out to do at Saint Laurent In a word selling His thorough refurb from advertising to video to music connections to multiple lines of product has turned Saint Laurent into a power brand More than that the success of his breaking down the house and rendering it into accessible uncomplicated items has set off a chain reaction at the top of the designer fashion industry Heads have been rolling and new ones put in place all over Milan New York and Paris as corporations scramble to cast talents they pray will be able to replicate Slimanes magic touch with multiproduct marketing With Alessandro Micheles appointment at Gucci the process has been working at speed but in some other places there are bandwagons still stuck in the garage  Not everyone can package up a look and whack it to the public in such a first-degree widely understandable and Zeitgeist-savvy way as Slimane For Spring one glance at the lowbrow tiaras the sparkly see-through mini-mesh dresses the rock-chick leather jackets and the skinny legs of the models shoved into Wellington boots told us where he was going To Glastonbury with Courtney and Kate it was with an entourage of throwback shaggy-headed waifs and a caravan-load of ready-made vintage-y stuff  Slimane was smart to suggest he was pitching it in a more down-to-earth way this season There is a movement toward real ordinary clothes going on largely triggered by the left-of-field rise of the Vetements collective which ingeniously repurposes generic garments Slimane seemed to have tuned into that when he came up with a perfectly ordinary beige trenchcoat sand-color camisole jeans and black Wellingtons a faded army-surplus shirt patchworked denim capes and leather bomber jackets that looked as if they could have been trawled from racks at the cheap end of Portobello Market Say what you like about whether this is actually design there is a skill in making a familiar-looking garment fit well and come off as generic enough to be absorbed into a girls wardrobe and Saint Laurents sales have shot up because of it  Still the grunge and glitter theme also gave Slimane the key to turning out his more special things too loads of variations on the bias-cut slip dress in metallic sequins or velvet patchwork liquid gold charmeuse or black silk plus glam fur and feather chubbies Finally though there is only one litmus test which will make this or any collection sell Is the girl on the runway someone other girls want to be Slimanes good at pushing classic youth-cultural buttons but in his casting the one thing hes not in touch with is the fact that todays young girls want to look at other girls who represent the way they look How long will it take for designers to realize how badly theyre cutting their own chances by not reflecting that$$Sally LaPointe is best known for her super-luxe knitsthink simple pullovers with fox-fur sleeves and plush cashmere-wool turtlenecks with just enough slouch Cozy textures are her thing but since its easier to experiment with pony hair leather and merino during the Fall season Spring always presents a challenge for the designer This time LaPointe translated her rich vision by juxtaposing lightweight textures that could still be layered in balmy weather I was really inspired by the idea of introverts and extroverts she said backstage I dont think you can pin anyone down and define them Everyone is kind of both so I wanted to present something with a lot of contrasts A glossy pony robe coat was spliced with pleated (and surprisingly pliable) vinyl and a chunky sleeveless sweater was thrown over a swishy sequin skirt It would make a chic party lookyou could even wear flats  LaPointe acknowledged that this was a new direction for the brand But her customers many of whom shop at Bergdorf Goodman her biggest retailer come back to her because they want luxurious wearable pieces that feel a bit unexpectedand that's just what they'll find here$$Saloni Lodha launched her brand on the strength of its signature printed dresses That focus has always served her well but this time around the designer finally feels shes in a place to branch out This is the biggest collection weve ever done said Lodha who added denim leather and T-shirt categories to her lineup this season I didnt want to expand too soon Now we are at a stage with our retailers where they really can see us as a full brand Brand extensions can go either way of course But here the new categories were a major boon Lodha successfully translated the lines signature playful femininity into those aforementioned leather and denim jackets jeans and T-shirts by way of clever embellishments A favorite included a 70s-inspired cropped denim jacket with a random spattering of grommets in primary colors that is sure to be street style photography bait next season while a leather jacket embroidered with flowers was an unexpected alternative for evening Often the new categories furthered themes that have been central to Lodhas aesthetic from the beginning A pair of organic natural-dye jeans in which you can see stripes of variation in the springy pink hue were made in Pondicherry India the same area that Lodha named her LLC for when she first launched her business But the core of the brand will always be printed dresses theyre a buyers no-brainer and a consistent best-seller For Spring the designer tweaked some of the offerings to go even more romantic with skin-baring cutouts and prints painted on lace All in all this collection was a strong step forward for Saloni$$Flavia Pennetta the Italian winner of this years US Open received a round of applause from the audience as the lights went down at Salvatore Ferragamo Her surprise victory didnt impact creative director Massimiliano Giornettis latest offering which was underway months ago nonetheless there was a certain synergy in the matchup Giornettis latest collection had a buoyant grace Though it's not activewear by any stretch of the imagination a woman could be active in these dresses and look great  Leather is almost obligatory chez Ferragamo even for Spring Giornetti did a fine job of making it suitable for warm weather cutting it in generous proportions and using bar-tacked seams that quite literally let a paperbag-waist skirt and loose-fitting culottes breathe But despite the houses shoemaking legacy the best pieces here werent skins Rather they were the midi-length sundresses in lofty cotton one in black with bows on the shoulder straps a strapless style with a wrapped waist in sky blue and another strapless frock that combined tiers or black dusty pink and coral Knit dresses had a springy bounce too By comparison chiffon numbers with feather embellishments looked fussy and there were a few too many extraneous bows on other pieces Still all in all this was a good-looking outing for Giornetti$$On a recent phone call Samu-Jussi Koski reported that the consensus from friends and family was that his clothes had done some growing up since last spring Its an unexpected comment perhaps given the certain ageless appeal that has always characterized the Samuji brand But there was a new serenity to this seasons looks owing in part to the scaled-back quirk factor Gone were the high-shine silver metallics the crafty mermaid print and the kicky colors In their place the designer delivered a concise lineup of spare tranquil pieces inspired by the glamour of mid-century film stars holidaying in the south of Italy the results were far from retro A palette that took its cues from the delicate shades of gelatopistachio melon peachlent a subtle sweetness tempered by modern-feeling shapes (terrific cropped flares) and fabrications (a glossy leather-like black resin-coated cupro) Knits remain a strong category for the label like a sheer sea-foam-color mock neck ideal for layering or svelte ribbed styles to team with an A-line mini Another strong suit of Koskis Outerwear especially two styles in washi paper a fabrication thats far more environmentally friendly than say viscose thats a choice that is both grown-up and great-looking$$Sea designers Sean Monahan and Monica Paolini have long been associated with a breezy hippieish spirit but theyve started to sense that others are encroaching on their territory Were trying to move away from boho a bit Monahan said surrounded by at least seven racks in the duos airy Canal Street loft (a fifth-floor escape amid the chaos of New York Fashion Week) Seas signatureslace eyelet embroidery and looser silhouettescertainly fit the boho stereotype and they also happen to be trending heavily elsewhere And while Sea consistently feels easy and effortless some other designers iterations of the boho trend seem overwrought So for Spring Monahan and Paolini opted for sleeker shapes such as culottes quilted jackets and boxy blouses and nixed their usual hand-distressing It added up to clothes that were as arty and youthful as ever but just a touch more refined which will only help them at their biggest stockist Barneys New York For example instead of holey jeans they washed their ice-blue denim over and over so it emerged as soft as cashmere It was particularly covetable on a slit-front midi skirt with a braided belt The designers also played with heavier more geometric lace patterns which felt refreshingly non-flimsy and in lieu of complicated embroideries they employed the beauty of natural textures like rumpled linen and crisp cotton  Without question daywear is Seas specialty but there were some surprisingly chic day-to-night propositions too like a deep-V indigo jumpsuit and an apron-front gingham dress Both would look equally lovely with white sneakers or glittery stilettos but it would be interesting to see what Monahan and Paolini might do with a tux or silk party dress$$Where does the See By Chlo girl go when the winds of travel blow her stateside Cali of course This season Clare Waight Keller imagined her muse roadtripping from San Francisco to Big Sur bringing with her clothes that reflected the houses Anglo-Franco vibe and all but guaranteed a good time Here were breezy pieces in a sunbleached palette that spoke to days spent driving around with the top down cream soft peach washed-out blues Denim came in two distinct formscrisp indigo and a supple lighter shade that felt akin to something you had worn and loved for years That was just one of many parallels with the looks that went down the main line runway last Spring frothy broderie anglaise here trimming blouses dreamy bohemian gowns head-to-toe total look dressing SBC even debuted another take on Waight Kellers jean maxi skirt this one slung low on the hips and with a frayed hem Elsewhere a geometric archival Chlo print from the seventies found new life in a knit dress and sweater There was plenty of lovely youthful sprezzatura to be had here and even if Chlos more senior customer might take a pass on the graphic sweatshirts you got the sense that she wouldn't hesitate to snap up other styles for some adventuring of her own$$When Sharon Wauchob said Sometimes you dont want to change anything and then there are times when youre hungry for something new she made a key admission of a feeling likely shared by other designers For this collection Wauchob was operating in the latter headspace without betraying the former One wouldnt normally associate her restrained and refined approach with the word unhinged yet thats how she framed this go-round pointing out how as a woman designer the end goal isnt necessarily shock value so much as defying expectations Wauchob did that by using techniques that imbued her clothes with a spectrum of strong personalities Whereas the crushed pleated silk jumpsuit registered as romantically restless bouncing with each stride a lace slip dress festooned with tufts of cardinal red silk fringe signaled something wilder The collection tempted from all directions in no case more than a skirt fronted with leather and backed with lace Even the unlined suede coats encircled with low-slung belts featuring an irregular brass medallion hinted at that same alluring ease If all that matters to a potential client is the degree of sheerness then that person is missing the point (or should stick to the ingenious cross-body bag dangling from a single eyelet) Suffice it to say the level of savoir faire surpassed layman explanations and with so many permutations of such provocative workmanship the fabrication details barely mattered With Wauchob its easy to default to calling her collections delicate but consider the slouched trousers sneakers and new sculptural jewelry by Chris Boland and the descriptor becomes imprecise at best Despite all the vintage and vaguely Asian influences this lineup captured Wauchobs desire to bridge past and future The desire has probably always been there its just taken her until now to let go of being understated$$Its really remarkable that Siblings Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery managed not only to put on a show this afternoon so soon after the death of their partner in style Joe Bates but to stage one filled with such joie de vivre The collection was dedicated to Bates whose presence was much felt by his absence but it was also a tribute to 60s starlets such as Monica Vitti and Brigitte Bardot and imagined them bumming around the Riviera in various iterations of leopard print The 60s reference wasnt particularly literal Bryan and McCreery gave it a strong disco gloss with lots of sparkling knits and their way of riffing on the eras fascination with man-made fabrications was to create skirts dresses and coats in whipstitched sculpted plastic Those items were highly editorial as were the cape and gown in a ball-bedecked crochet Other looks were more street-ready The glittery knit slip dresses and cardigans were accessible and appealing while items in leopard-print denim could happily find a home in many a sassy girls wardrobe A short-sleeved swing coat in the denim seemed well suited to a contemporary would-be Bardot The highlights of the show however were two other similarly shaped pieces of outerwear The frilled plastic and gold-tipped knit coats had the madcap quality one seeks in a Sibling collection and showcased the labels signature innovative knit work but they came off as viably wearable rather than camp or experimental or absurd No doubt Bates would have been proud$$Jake Sargent and Daniel Corrigans Spring outing for Simon Miller combined their perennial Japanese influences with an American Southwest attitude Here was a collection that was sparse in spirit but had a great richness to it thanks to the fabrications the designers opted for Their biggest aesthetic splurges came where color was concerned Pops of burnt red and chartreuse felt right in step with more sun-bleached neutrals and tawny nubuck Also new this season A strong move into bags at opposite ends of the size spectrum from the itty-bitty Bonsai with ring handleswhich was right in step with street styles current yen for tiny shapesto a big bucket bag to carry all your worldly possessions and sling over your shoulder Knitwear was especially appealing Chalk that up to the Japanese silk tops and skirts which projected a kind of cool mid-century austerity As far as denim was concerned the duo made a bet on their great wide leg as a hero silhouette offering it in a buttery suede that will be tough to beat in terms of simple laid-back luxury for spring In addition to the bags the pair is finding other ways of emphasizing Simon Miller as a lifestyle brand They have launched an eyewear collaboration with New York optical legend Sol Moscot and teamed up for an offbeat sandal capsule collection with the cultlike Japanese footwear label Jojo Simon Miller may not be a new kid on the block but in Sargent and Corrigans expert hands it continues its confident march toward becoming a household name$$Its a wonderful thing when a young designer truly comes into her own at a point when expectations and respect have already been running high but then she simply exceeds all that Simone Rocha sent that feeling through her audience today withwhen it comes down to itthe amazing things she did with pink dresses That sounds narrow if not sugary but from the two semitransparent opening looks she showedpuff-sleeved full-skirted and boldly bisected with black macram strapsshed already riveted the attention of everyone who had come to see her show in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London It takes some daring for a young designer to hire a former royal palace heaving with gilding and British establishment history but there she was amongst the grandeur it all showing an entrancing collection which succeeded in elevating her talent for prettiness sexuality tenderness and quirky techniques to a new level Where did that come from I found out I was pregnant while I was in Japan working on a project with Dover Street Market Ginza and then went on to Kyoto for a few days said Rocha I was suddenly seeing everything so intensely it felt trippy It wasnt a collection which overtly stated Japanese influenceswhich of course can be hackneyedso much as it insinuated and abstracted them Part of it was down to Rochas adulation of the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki to whose bar she made a pilgrimage in Tokyo Arakis body of work involves specialist bondage practices peculiar to Japan Thats what triggered Rocha to start thinking about knots and braids and begin developing cross-body straps whole bodices in clear plastic and finishing dresses with silken strands running across bare backs  Rarely have the notions of prettiness and perversity from a young womans point of view come together so potently This was also a collection which absolved Rocha of any former accusations of heaviness and repetition Her airy bouncy organza skirts put paid homage to that just as the new chic bubble-sleeved narrow dresses the series of spongy tailoring decorated with kimono-cum-couture bows and the green bamboo-forest prints proved something else Rocha has range It was a personal breakthrough$$The girl who wears Sonia by Sonia Rykiel may be updating her wardrobe every seasona coat with trompe l'oeil detailing here a leather striped miniskirt therebut shes consistently the same playful gal at heart For Spring there happened to be a lot of hearts embroidered together as broderie anglaise swirled into a bandana paisley frilled and tacked onto the shoulders of a tee studded to the back of a heel (the liveliest of all appeared mid-wink as if making eye contact with its Comme des Garons pals) There were other motifs too including warmly hued rainbows simplified flowers and a particularly sassy pair of lips that could be zipped open and shut from the chest of a sweater  If the collection sounds like it put too much emphasis on throwback prints the overall effect didnt exhaust the eyes This was largely owing to additional themes that expanded upon reliable Rykiel signatures A denim story for instance did not always consist of jeans indigo tweed cleverly conveyed as much versatility while dark blue satin dressed down a sequined shift For all the integrated embellishments accessories factored stronglyand surrealisticallyin giving the looks an updated twist See also the sparkly socks paired with high-heeled sandals And when a Lurex dress specially knit to appear striped was referred to as ideal date-night attire the sweet side of Sonia by Sonia suddenly turned coquettish Except that this Rive Gauche girl of the street (the photos taken once again by Sonia Sieff show Langley Fox posing in the middle of the road) is far more likely to wear her heart on her sleeve than make an outright shameless gesture$$We were back at Sonia Rykiels famous Left Bank shop for Julie de Librans Spring show today The recently installed bookshelves were covered with black velvet curtains and the runway glittered like wet pavement Waiters passed around electric blue cocktails and Londons CAR provided the soundtrack setting the stage for a collection pitched mostly toward evening Saint-Germain-des-Prs in addition to its famous brasseries and cafs also has a thriving club culture according to the program notes In De Librans first two runway shows for the French brand the offerings were broader but this one began and ended with sequins  In between the designer touched on the famous Rykiel sweaters turning out baseball-style tees in a thick crochet that looked handmade and slinky pliss knit dressesbut sadly there were no stripes the house signature Note to designers at heritage brands Dont ignore the heritage The shows loose theme was les oiseaux de nuitnight owlso there were bird motifs on everything from a poplin camp shirt to silk pajama sets and more than a few marabou feather stoles Cotton dresses in a swallow print that looked a lot like camo were the shows best pieces danceable yet also easy to wear during the day We wouldnt have minded seeing more of that kind of thing But before or after dark easy-to-wear was an imperative for De Libran The holographic sequin dresses that closed the show were knitted not embroidered and the back sides were fine-gauge sweaters meaning they were as light as can be and as comfortable as a T-shirt but glam nonetheless$$The Sophie Theallet show this evening kicked off with a bang A literal one Audience members snapped to attention as a drummer pounded out a loud beat from the far reaches of Theallets outdoor show space The attention was called for as this latest collection from the designer was one for which you wanted to be wide awake This was a joyful fashion show The music supplied by a troupe of Senegalese drummers was thoroughly happy-making and so were the clothes the best that Theallet has ever produced Africa was the key reference here unabashedly so It was a dream of Africa as Theallet put it that she extrapolated via textures of raffia and burlap cape silhouettes and extraordinary couture-quality lace that read a bit like snakeskin There were also beautiful smudged black-and-white prints that riffed on tribal body paint and halter necklines redolent of traditional African chokers Theallet was appropriating but with such a fluency and generosity of spirit and with such good instincts about how to integrate her African inspiration into prototypically Western silhouettes that the appropriation felt earned The Theallet womanand she was a woman not a girlhadnt just gone to Africa and returned with some fresh ideas about aesthetics Shed come back with a whole new point of view There were too many standout looks here to list them all Theallet made magic with her lace using it with subtlety as a cobwebby layer of black on top of a caramel-colored cape and to much more graphic effect in gridded dresses and skirts She also wowed the crowd with two sexy striped lace jumpsuits that were shown on genuinely full-figured girls (This Theallet show was a model for diverse casting in general by the way) Theallet updated her signature hourglass silhouette with panache using broad raffia belts to set off her full shorts and mid-calf skirts The halter-neck dresses and gowns featuring tiers of feathers and raffia strips belong on a red carpet posthaste And the daywear spanned from breezily feminine with ruffled silk dresses in a small smudged dot print to burlap linen tailoring that was almost utilitarian it was so matter-of-fact Theallet finally found her niche as a tailor with this collectionthese looks were nearly as confident as the diaphanous sheer numbers that found her revisiting the brand vocabulary thats been native to her from the start It was fitting that this show concluded with a burst of drumming and dancing Theallet was due a celebration$$Clinically minimal with a twist of 60s redux (deluxe) this maritime-seasoned Sportmax collection should cruise serenely from runway to store rack to wardrobe A toughened-up pinafore shirthemmed dress in heavy white cotton featured the round black pockets that were the ongoing contradiction to pure restraint here They also came on wide sailor pants a lightweight parka and a high-waisted jacket used as a topsail over a white silk blouse There was so much finely draped fabric a-swoosh at the base of another pinafore that sailed forth full-length and zingily orange that it was hard to make out if it qualified strictly as a dress (possible) or jumpsuit (probably) Assuredly the latter was a deep-V-neck kicky-legged muster of irregular monochrome stripes against navy and more orange A pair of tangerine-size eyelets just above the navel on a white shirtdress and a blue front-zip culottes-suit allowed for some hearty here-to-there belt knotting The chain print that clanked to the foreground neatly mirrored the chrome buckles on collars and accompanying bucket bags Cast next was a net print on silk jumpsuits sweaters and skirts before the introduction of grids of round lace as a curtain-closing motif The lack of a Breton stripe showed admirable restraint in what was a Cardin-tinged assembly of sea-flecked 21st-century staples placid and pleasing$$As in seasons past Stella Jeans show was a vibrant cultural nook Despite its bold colors and zingy patterns this was no straightforward travel story Migration was the topic the Italo-Haitian designer highlighted Wednesday through her Spring offering which she showcased refreshingly on a multi-racial model cast In the face of the largest movement of refugees on the Continent since World War II and with Italy becoming one of the main landing points it was a bold move to launch a windblown Milan Fashion Week with a statement and in a new and apt venuethe citys recently opened cultural center Museo delle Culture (Museum of Cultures) or Mudec Departure was the starting point and the designers printed T-shirts emblazoned with imagery from Once Upon a Time in Americathe Sergio Leone filmwas a pithy reference to Italys historical flux From there sweeping in scope the saturated colors rich textures and intricate detailing of the opening looks drew references from South American climes Voluminous printed flounced and maxi skirts recalled traditional Salvadoran dressSalvador is commonly called Bahiaand the spot where immigrants historically entered Brazil Pom-poms tassels and beads embellished many of Jeans playful accessories like great raffia bejeweled slides and handbags Roomy Andean-striped coats and jackets as well as cactus and parrot prints were a contemporary take on the regions ornate style Overlapping continents Jeans signature Wax & Stripes designsmade of vibrant patterns worn across West Africaappeared as ruffle-sleeved tunics and skirts and prim appropriations of silk pussy-bow blouses From there the collection shifted to England Highlighting the current exponential growth of Italian immigration to the UK Savile Row tailoring was the designers inspiration and trenchcoats and natty shirting the material result Embracing what her label is known forusing African prints on European formsJeans barefooted finale consisted of very commercial beachwear with a retro 50s aira breezy way to end her powerful far-flung adventure$$The key to summertime dressing is effortlessness Its a principle that Stella McCartney applies to all of her collections and it was in full effect at her upbeat show this morning where she put a major emphasis on knits Knitwear has become more visible on Spring runways over the last couple of fashion cycles as innovative computer-enabled techniques have allowed designers to do things not possible before Theres another reason sweater dressing is on the rise and it comes down to the comfort factor McCartneys layered tanks polo shirts and tube skirts looked stretchy as activewear sporty and poised for action on the athletic sandals they paraded out on but elevated in bright stripes checks and transparencies She also played with vibrant pleated knits in loose trapeze-like shapes with sexy cutaways Its been a great week for color in Paris but McCartneys as bold as anybody combining vivid orange and blue or chili red with pink on those knit separates Swirls of ribbon embroidery made a similarly strong impact on tracksuits and dresses Her other project here was rethinking the suit which has been an icon of the brand from the beginning She did that via deconstruction a double-breasted black jacket was transformed into a strapless form-fitting tunic worn over a multi-slit skirt And she did it by using unexpected materials as was the case with an off-the-shoulder jacket and slouchy pants cut from raw indigo denim with high-contrast white stitching More conventional pieces like vests and trousers had an appealing fluidity and elongated proportions  Slip dresses were another key component of her first collection postSaint Martins nigh on 20 years ago Theres never been a bigger moment for boudoir dressing than Spring 2016 but McCartney more or less avoided the subject A missed opportunity Not really In acid hues her swirling eyelet dresses will stand out at stores next spring$$The first thing Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty wanted to talk about backstage at this mornings Suno show was the shoes After umpteen seasons collaborating with Nicholas Kirkwood Suno has launched its own line of Italian-made footwear Beatty said the goal was to create shoes that looked distinctive but that were easy to wear Not too precious she explained but also not you know too fierce Not too precious/not too fierce also served as a good summation of the clothes on Sunos runway Inspired by a visit to the recent exhibition When the Curtain Never Comes Down at the American Folk Art Museum the designers riffed on the practice of outsider artists who channeled compulsive mental states into their work Their focus was on the ways that these artists would use geometry to create a sense of orderhence the collections repeating square patterns and numerous looks belted (Beatty used the apt word restricted) at the waist One of the nice ways that Beatty and Osterweis got at their theme was by introducing little grace notes of off-ness such as the seemingly random placement of gathers on items like the opening dress in gingham They also made reference to the origin of their inspiration by using folksy techniques and fabricsthat gingham for instance but also eyelet peasant blousestyle ruching and denim A calf-length denim skirt shown with a matching belted minidress was the best look in the show$$Im not your seductress That was designer Suzanne Raes mantra for Spring a manifesto for women who dress for themselves not the gaze of others in short her customers Rae makes quietly arty staples that place an emphasis on construction and fit Here she struck a balance between concealing and revealing boxy unisex shapes like kimonos in Japanese denim and clingier bias-cut dresses Trousers and tops in a sheeny cotton nylon were standouts and gave way to other novel fabrications like a white Italian jacquard splashed all over with burnout blooms That print felt like a rarebut welcomeextravagance among so many garments that receded down to their clear buttons One development for Rae that was anything but retiring A group of two-tone ribbed knits in juicy jolie-laide color combos there was a certain seductiveness to themthe kind that will pit cool girls against their wallets$$When asked backstage about the through line for his Spring 2016 collection Tadashi Shoji summed it up in one word Japan The designer has been feeling nostalgic of late Maybe he suggested because Im old For Resort he mined his childhood spent in Japan and this season he continued the theme with an homage to his native country in the springtime  Shoji drew from the obvious The peonies irises and cherry blossoms that explode all over the country in spring were clearly the inspiration behind a number of looksperhaps too much so A frothy pink cupcake of a gown with fluffy floral appliqus for instance unmistakably recalled the sakura in bloom It was far from groundbreaking to be sure but for Shojis customer thats not necessarily a problem The designer seemed to save up all his daring for a handful of sheer gowns with strategically placed floral embroidery to conceal the good bitsnot unlike the headline-making gown Beyonc wore to the Met Gala this year Everybody is doing sheerRihanna and all those people are doing it and revealing a lot [on the red carpet] said Shoji backstage But I dont like that So I very nicely hid everything and it still looks beautiful Shojis clients will no doubt appreciate the modesty$$By Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhofs estimation they have done about 800 variations of their ruched stretch dress whose svelte effect has endeared the brand to legions of political wives red carpet regulars and other women with busy social lives back home in Germany and elsewhere Thanks to that little number Talbot Runhof has quietly built a small empire and last spring the house unveiled a new flagship in a Baroque-style manse in Munich  Theres always a lot going on at Talbot Runhof For Spring the story was very much about a palatial lifestyle In the same spirit as last seasons homage to Mona Bismarck a copy of the lavish Marella Agnelli The Last Swan picked up at Rizzoli in New York City became the springboard for exploring what the duo terms sleek maximalism In other words they remained true to their love of intricacy but toned down the volume just a tad sticking to noble fabrics and a neutral palette jazzed up with the occasional splash of blue The result was a succession of loose elongated silhouettes in crisp sun-pleated chiffon satin and crepe sometimes paired with an embroidered shell in layered taffeta trimmed with silk tassels at other times with ecru trousers and always worn with palazzo slippers in candy-color satin  Obviously this woman is not headed to an office anytime soon But if the clothes were intended to feel like a perpetual vacation the collection also nodded to the empire that made the Agnelli lifestyle possible The iconic Fiat factory in Turin Italy for example was the concept behind the modernist Lingotto print that cropped up on a silk top caftan and long cotton skirt Likewise an Art Decoinflected cogs-and-gears print emerged on a chiffon pantsuit and under a veneer of transparent sequins on an evening gown Elsewhere the pair threw it into high gear to express movement in rows of fringe in guipure lace and laser-cut hologram foil on a sleeveless tweed jacket The one-off white parka with tufts of fil coupe was a bit of a wild ride the designers allowed Wisely they stopped there And anyway it was aperitivo time$$Tamara Mellon the cofounder and former CEO of Jimmy Choo is a businesswoman with a flourishing eponymous line and the empire-touting uniform to match It makes sense that she has a knack for translating that knuckle-under look into her collections Her latest was a riff on the I am woman hear me roar soundtrack of the 70s translated into body-skimming frocks long and lean jumpsuits and plenty of look-at-me shine So what does the wardrobe of the fearless woman who has it all include There were Amazonian Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman references a hot pink maxi dress spliced in the midsection with a studded leather eyelet for a sliver of skin and a thick bodice wrapped around the waist of a light dress for a cinched hourglass look There was also a dash of Studio 54 with nods to other retro heroines of the night like a slinky silver Lurex jumpsuit which could have been worn by Bianca Jagger As for Mellons bold signature punch of animal prints there was a bare-shoulder leopard-print frock complete with a thigh-skimming slit Perhaps thinking of the woman on the go Mellon referenced the optic white jumpsuits she designed for the crew of Blade a helicopter service that flies passengers to the Hamptons This time she made them in dark denim complete with a thick collar and a front zippera piece which ought to make the wearer feel like shes in the pilots seat$$Tanya Taylora longtime proponent of color and cheerstood in all white at the end of a rainbow-filled room at the presentation of her Spring 2016 collection The designer had enlisted the Minneapolis street artist Hot Tea (n Eric Rieger) to dangle thousands of pieces of colored yarn from the ceiling of the Swiss Institute in Soho for her show (he is the artist who yarn-bombed the Williamsburg Bridge in 2013 bedecking the pedestrian overpass into a Crayola-hued canopy) It was just the most beautiful thing said Taylor I wanted to bring it here Color ricocheted throughout the gallery spacethough really it would have anyway Taylors designs reveled in hand-painted floral prints checks stripes oversize knits woven through with braided Swarovski beading boldly striped sundresses and subtle safari detailing like that on a plaid seersucker pleated sundress that laced up the bodice A first foray into denim was as light and feminine as the rest of the showing boasting a Swiss dot effect across a military-esque anorak and lace laser-cut edges at the hems of cropped trousers A swingy bell-sleeved frock was garden-party ready with green pleated cuffs and skirt the sort of thing that one pops on and is immediately coaxed to twirl Sure texture was especially important this season for Taylor (who spent part of the summer in Kenya with the Clinton Foundation and came away from her Maasai cultural experience with an increased interest in beading) but the message of the collection was one of pretty above all else And you know what There are far worse things to be for spring$$Telfar ranks among that rarefied group of mens labels on the utilitarian unisex front where the question of gender hangs in the air but doesnt actually come into question In fact said designer Telfar Clemens before the show and without a moments hesitation I kind of started the whole thing Which is to say that particular shade of ambiguity is at this point beside the point Its old hat by now blurred subverted transcended Plus this is the labels 25th season making it more of a seasoned grown-up than a scrappy young thing hell-bent on provocation Born out of a streetwise functionality Telfar aspires to exactly that Subliminal branding the designer asserted nothing frivolous Of course frivolity is in the eye of the beholder and it remains to be seen what the beholder makes of off-the-shoulder tanks dress shirts with missing sides and halter tops whose spaghetti straps stretch over a mans articulated shoulders to a comical cheeky effect That and a pair of white daisy dukes practically shrink-wrapped over bulging thighs were among the only suggestions of old-school drag Shoes straddled the fence between ballet flats and standard-issue Vans-style sneakers As for branding the name Telfar brazenly scrawled down the front of shirts in a lacy mesh and a TC logo stitched into every other piece werent exactly subliminal but droll insider references to logomania never go unappreciated  Clemens also indulged in a fussy obsession with the numbers six and eight wherein detailsparticularly cargo pocketsappeared no fewer than six or eight times on a given sleeve belt loop tag and so on Bizarre to be sure but it added to the collections curious enigmatic allure To say nothing of the backdrop a trippy animation of the designer as avatar mixed with allusions to the sponsor White Castle Product placement was never like this$$According to the Temperley London show notes laid out on attendees seats the theme of Alice Temperleys latest collection was Havana This was one of those occasions where after the final dfil you glanced again at those notes considered what youd just seen on the runway and thought Nah Its not that Temperley didnt reference Havana or her private fantasy of Havana in these clothes its just that the Cuban motifs ran a distant second in importance to the shows real theme which was embroidery The heart of this collection was Temperleys heavily embroidered sundresses and likewise embellished sundress-esque ensembles Backed in crisp white or navy cotton these pieces came in a variety of relaxed silhouettes and played host to a virtual fireworks display of floral and abstract embroidered patterns Theyll be catnip on the sales floorindeed women who dont usually gravitate to Temperley may find themselves tempted by the sundress looks The designer deployed similar styles of embroidery on more formal tulle-backed dresses and separates as well The look of the decorative embroidery was repeated on non-embroidered garments too Notably Temperleys signature intarsia knits echoed the effect as did some of the pieces in printed silk The collection as a whole had a winning sense of easeeven the tailored looks shared in its languorous tropical vacation tone which was amplified by the romance of Temperleys occasional ruffles and flounces The one quibble really was with the full-on evening looks The combination of mirror sequins and tassel embroidery came off a touch de trop Temperley did better with her more casual takes on the category in particular the silk kimono gown in a tropical bird print Here at least the show notes rang true The dress was embroidery-free and the Havana theme came through$$At her presentation this afternoon Tess Giberson admitted that her latest collection was really just an extension of the one shed designed for Resort No complaints thereGibersons Resort collection was a rich yet concise interpretation of her experience visiting Walter Gropius's house in Massachusetts and given that she had more to say about Gropiuss home it was nice to find her revisiting the theme As Giberson put it her focus this time was on moments within the house rather than its overarching aesthetic impact With that in mind she dilated on details such as the lacing on chairs or the fringes of a pillow and expanded them into recurring motifs The fringe came off particularly wellclean and un-hippieishwhile the lacing used widely made for some of the sexiest looks Giberson has ever produced notably the double-slit skirt with a front panel of upholstery-like jacquard Another winning extrapolation from chez Gropius was the deep blue watercolor striped silk taken from a duvet which Giberson made into a fantastic pieced-together slip dress It looked like just the thing to wear on a hot and humid summer daya day you might say a lot like this one Pieces in bone-white mesh were just as suited to swampy weather while micro-pleated trousers detailed with a canny ankle slit or ribbed knit dresses with architectural cabling about the neckline had a more trans-seasonal durability As a whole this collection continued the roll that Giberson has been onif she needs to continue making pilgrimages to the homes of great architects to keep it going so be it$$For his Spring 2016 collection Thakoon Panichgul filled his front row with It-girl artists (Langley Fox Hemingway Phoebe Collings-James) and a smattering of actresses who like to align themselves with a certain artistic sensibility (Bella Heathcote Christina Ricci Jessica Alba) and really who better than the very fetching and creatively inclined to celebrate what the designer called a vision of the New Bohemia  For Thakoon that New Bohemia will be tie-dyed From the bleached lightweight denim to the slim silk slip dresses printed with a grunge grid to the crinkled chiffon evidence of the hippie-favored coloring technique was everywhere on his runway And what the designer proposed do bohemians love more than tie-dye Wearing their pajamas of course Out came all manner of elegant attire for sleep enthusiasts seemingly Julian Schnabelinspired chambray robe coats and scoop-hemmed micro-shorts (longer in the center mimicking the hem of a sleep shirt) in pale shades of robins-egg blue with trim crimson piping or pure white terry cloth all worn with immediately covetable comely flat sandals that were halfway between a huarache and a gladiator As for wearing your pajamas out on the town when youre busy being creative who has time for clothes Well actresses do of course and the most winning takeaways came in the sleekly crisp bicolored broderie anglaise dressesjust the thing for a Cannes photo call (Theres plenty of time to divulge your artistic leanings at the press conference straight after)$$Whats new in Greg Chaits hyper-luxe world of knits Plenty The Elder Statesman has amped up its offerings over the past couple of seasons and for Spring there was a lot to love For one thing Chait worked with middle-weight yarn for the first time turning out strong pieces like a pink cold-shoulder dress and a gauzy milk-white jumper Elsewhere sweatpants and a hoodie (as you might imagine a far decadent cry from the Champion of your adolescence) came printed all over in the softest of gradient rainbows And what kind of comfort-hating monster could argue with propositions like black-and-white striped pull-on cashmere shorts or a pastel hand-tie-dyed polo maxi dress in silk cashmere Most importantly Chaits clothes dont just feel goodthey look good Take a woven Kenyan cotton with an irregular hand in a gorgeous mottled cream color smashing in a pair of button-front trousers or the plushest Italian cashmere as woven on a traditional backstrap loom in Central America The latter came whipped into a dreamy top with softly fraying edges and a crocheted neckline and the effect was as quietly polished as many a piece youd find at the high-end stores where The Elder Statesman is carried And despite a laid-back brand image that polish continues to distinguish the label As Chait himself tells it Theres a free-spiritedness but were not hippies Doubtful Look no further than this seasons hero graphic tee which read simply Hippies are ruining the world$$It may not always look like it from the pictures but the traditional order and format of shows has been thrown up in the air over the past year At the luxury level innumerable houses have decided to break the system and show when where and how they choose in order to reach the women they most want to engage which has sent guests off on many a globe-trotting trip in pursuit of the fashion experience Now The Row has done the same not showing in its hometown New York but shifting to Paris where as Mary-Kate Olsen explained many of our customers are who we want to support As you will see tomorrow we are having a show in a chteau 45 minutes outside Paris Now 45 minutes outside Paris tantalizing as that sounds does not fit the schedules of journalists who are doing the rounds of the shows every hour on the hour So yesterday Mary-Kate and sister Ashley gave them a preview of what a more exclusive crowd will be seeing today Its interesting to speculate how this collection will go down among a mixed European audience In one way The Row comes straight out of the American tradition of simplicity and pure lines which goes back to the minimalism of the 80s and even further to principles of usefulness that have roots in the pioneering spirit Though the Olsens showed a couple of draped chiffon minidresses and a sheer pleated two-piece here their natural design instinct is to stay far away from the body and keep any sense of sexual display under wraps (there was literally a linen blanket coat) and feet grounded in slides In a way they are passive resisters to the idea of trends and fashiontheirs is work that comes under the heading of lifestyle and a luxuriously serene one too Thats the point at which the philosophy is likely to connect most easily with a certain French tradition that also fundamentally rejects nouveau display The Row isnt Herms but maybe the Olsens can persuade their Euro audience that they share the same kind of sensibilities$$Back in the mid-90s when Lisa Kulson was designing the first pairs of Theory pants she mightve rolled her eyes at the high-water trousers that are the look of the moment now We all probably would have But fashion changes and in its latest incarnation Theory is in the business of responding to those shifts I want women to think of us as a lifestyle brand Kulson said under a cloudless sunset on the rooftop of the companys Meatpacking District headquarters Were not the brand that made your first interview suit anymore  There were culottes and slouchy track pants and walking shorts Polka dots and stripes featured in the mix A suede tunic and coat nodded slightly at the 70s And the off-the-shoulder silhouette thats suddenly everywhere turned up on both a top and a belted dress But it was a navy pair of those high-water trousersschoolboy pants is how Kulson described themthat got editors jazzed tonight Throw in the matching navy blazer with brass buttons and the whole suit would cost less than the pants alone at the fancy French house that did them first Smart$$Its hard to know what to say about a collection like the one Thom Browne showed today Not because theres nothing to write aboutindeed theres so so muchbut because Browne telegraphs his messages so overtly theres not much room for interpretation Browne is kind of a control freak as designers go You can see that in the fastidiousness of his collectionstheir silhouettes their fabrications their embellishments their presentation This is not a bad thing But one of the things he wants to control is the meaning of his clothes Which means his collections are about what theyre aboutno less and (heres the rub) no more In lieu of interpretation theres description And as usual Brownes outing today was a feast for the eyes He offered the audience a red herring in the set It seemed thanks to the feet sticking out from under the bare-bones house hed installed at the center of his runway that there was a Wizard of Oz theme afoot You might have validated that guess in the way the collection shifted at one point from all-grayscale looks to ones in color But no The real clues were in the desks inside the house the models sat at after concluding their deliberate dfil and in their little jackets and pleated skirts and in the Japonerie motifs inscribed on those tailored pieces in elaborate and nearly trompe loeil ways Browne was riffing on the aesthetic and the mien of Japanese schoolgirls Cest tout The decoration of Brownes looks was awe-inspiring at the levels of both inventiveness and craft The reiterated jackets and pleated skirts were collaged together or embroidered in ways to evoke Mount Fuji landscapes or patterns of cherry blossom or koi or Edo-style illustrations of geishas Certain looks expanded the canvas of the clothes to include intarsia minks Others like the jaw-dropping ribbon-embroidered pastel sack jacket gave a more abstract watercolor effect The techniques and the silhouettes varied but a sense of uniformity prevaileda sense Browne imparted purposefully of course Theres undoubtedly a pair of trousers languishing in the sales collection associated with the one Browne showed on the catwalk but the story Browne was telling at his show was emphatically one of jackets pleated skirts coordinated long button-downs worn as layering pieces and frequently a coat The individual garments betrayed Brownes idiomatic sense of whimsy and wit but as a whole they towed a party line The only exception was in the finale look a radiantly iridescent confection of floor-length layered pleats This was the schoolmarm and by the time she emerged from backstage Browne had more than made his point Its a credit to his artistry that it was a pleasure to see it underlined$$Thomas Taits show this afternoon was one of those odd outings that dont seem at first to be up to much but then accrue in force as the looks accumulate The impact of Taits latest collection generated from the ways the clothes forced your engagement whether via the play of light on assertive multicolor crystal embellishment or the sound made by the jewelry that dangled off of certain pieces jangling like cat bells The most intriguing of Taits stratagems to command your attention were the porthole-like openings that decorated all manner of his garmentsthey were like little windows for Peeping Toms to peer through and the more Tait reiterated the motif the more you keyed into the collections compelling voyeuristic tone Tait intended that reaction As he explained backstage after the show he wanted these clothes to create a sense of awkward intimacy Job done Others of Taits engaging effects were more subtle He was playing quite a lot with texture here notably in his ribbed knits and his terrific jeans with their patches of super-shiny black patent leather other looks pulled you in with their wabi-sabi appeal like the frayed quilted jacket and coat or a leather A-line skirt made from antique calfskin Tait also used the skin in his strangest look a heavy jumpsuit featuring a monumental pattern and exaggerated perforation down the sides The piece was interesting on its own but something of an outlier in the context of the rest of the show which emphasized rather accessible silhouettes Taits stovepipe skinny knit flares for instance ought to excite widespread demand Ditto his ribbed knits and the cuffed jeans and denim jacket If Taits goal was to create intimacy he nailed it in those most straightforward looks The best way to be intimate with clothes after all is by wearing them$$Celebrating their 10th anniversary as a trio (Gabi Asfour Angela Donhauser and Adi Gil) minus one from an earlier incarnation Threeasfours designers feel as tightly bound as ever finishing each others sentences and moving about in lockstep This year the brand is also celebrating the win of the National Design Award for Fashion Design from Cooper Hewitt a prestigious honor backed by the First Ladyquite a different image from its other first lady Bjrk This is a new dawn for Threeasfour and the designers wanted to demonstrate the newfound serenity purity and wearability noted Gabi with a higher message of unity for Spring Were like the United Nations of fashion and art added Adi Against a large-scale fractal projection by video artist Alex Czetwertynski the opening look set the just-futuristic-enough tone with its spirals of 3-D-printed digital lace and what the designers call topographic sandals A series of finely cut and layered organza and voile pieces followedthe curvilinear no-corners look thats become the label's signatureas well as a foray into mens with lapel-less jackets and coats As always textures were an integral part of the story they ranged from waxed cotton and neoprene to milky latex and clear vinyl Those fractals returned as prints as the palette of crisp white and shiny champagne gave way to deep earthy reds In spite of its seasoned new maturity Threeasfour can still deliver a drop-jaw moment which here came as clusters of mica mineral sheets adorning the front of a dress and in another look chunks of various agate crystals linked together to form a bodice The message was clear Threeasfour is rock solid$$Designers often refer to a new collection as their baby but at her presentation in her Chelsea town house today Tia Cibani had the real thing sleeping upstairs Five days ago Cibani gave birth to a baby boy the second of her two children While the timing wasnt exactly convenient Cibani made the most of it graciously showing guests around her spacious modern home and sneaking upstairs when she could Plus since Cibani was pregnant throughout the design process there was a tidy logic to showing the collectionher other babyso close to giving birth Cibani was inspired by lush and exotic landscapes in Brazil and the dichotomy between the countrys vibrant festive Samba culturewhich inspired the colorful brushstroke printand the serene beauty of Bahia which influenced the monochromatic looks made from lightweight linen blends Cibani had a lot of fun with texture this seasonfor example mixing hand-embroidered tufted fabrics with raw silks and bouclwhich made the head-to-toe black and white looks the strongest A collaboration with Mt Washington Pottery that yielded long ceramic necklaces like mini sculptures emphasized the earthiness of the collection  Exotic locales aside it was Cibanis pregnancy that helped inform the loose silhouettes and practical versatility of each piece Standouts included a jumpsuit that came in black-and-white sueded cupro and had an adjustable wraparound tie and a billowy ecru coat that was finished with white tape Each look was styled with slip-on Birkenstock flats  Its like yoga clothes but elevated said Cibani who not inconsequentially did a lot of prenatal yoga while pregnant Overall the feeling of the collection is more relaxed$$Kind of chilled out Thats how designer Amy Smilovic described her latest outing which was all about easesomething well no doubt be grateful for when the sticky days of summer (or as in todays case early fall) start rolling in again As a rule silhouettes were long and loose and mostly came in silk or cotton Smilovic said she was inspired by recent trips to Miami and Malibu which put her on a restorative kick and got her thinking about individuality I think with the whole normcore thing people fall too much into uniforms she said I know Im craving to mix it up For Smilovic that meant getting out of her comfort zone working with elements that are almost tacky and making them more refined The once-loathed Bermuda short which came in a variety of colors and materials including a surprising iridescent silk taffeta were a mainstay of the collection Color combinations like forest green offset by a muted turquoise or sapphire paired with slate blue were delightfully off-kilter Smilovic is not a sequin person but in the spirit of trying something new she coated dresses skirts tops and shorts in the shiny stufftweaking silhouettes and palette to ensure it stayed on the right side of tacky For instance on a pair of sequin shorts the crotch and hem were dropped and the silhouette kept loose to turn on its ear what you would imagine when you think of a Miami woman in a sequin short  The sequins were employed to surprisingly sophisticated and beautiful effect on an ankle-grazing dress which came in black and pale pink and interspersed strips of the sparkly material with sheer fabric in the same hue But the dress that every fashion girl will want to wear come spring was the slinky slip dress in nude or oxblood updated with a round neckline and thick straps Smilovic often styles her own shows but this season she worked with Vanessa Traina Snow and the stylists knack for minimalism can be seen in these unadorned slip dresses which were worn without jewelry Expect to see those and the billowy off-the-shoulder tops on the street next season$$As seems to be de rigueur at the moment (see Raf Simons) Belgian designer Tim Coppens delved into the mist of his own adolescent psyche for Spring Quite logically the womens collectionshown in an empty storefront where the lookbook was being shot around the corner from his Soho studiois practically a mirror image of his menswear After all mens was his first calling for which he won a CFDA Fashion Award last year establishing the upstart among New York's fashion firmament For 30-something Belgians plunging into 90s-era adolescence necessarily means a revisit of clubland Indeed Coppens said he went to raves every weekend for five years He translated that time definitely not wasted into melting mushroom prints on bowling-league jackets and sweatshirts an amoeba print taken from his teenage notebook and a fantastic Prince of Wales blue seersucker evocative of ballpoint doodles Bomberssome cropped others keeping their original mens proportionswere another highlight they came baggy yet richly detailed with pockets padding and raw edges Thick-rib tanks and Japanese denim skirts in darker shades lent another dose of not-too-retro appeal Despite the rave-girl roots traces of grown-up tailoring ran throughout in silky evening jackets and a floor-length diaphanous black tunic Meanwhile the sponsors of that CFDA Fashion Award Swarovski have clearly taken a shine to Coppens supplying him with loads of beadspearly ones not flashy rhinestones in keeping with his minimalist tendencies$$First and foremost Timo Weilands clothes are meant to be wearable Add flattering and comfortable to the list too Weiland and his codesigners Donna Kang and Alan Eckstein are very much a part of the New York fashion scene but they arent about to endorse completely sheer dresses or high-concept frippery That doesnt mean the clothes are boring though it seems the goal of every contemporary label is to master easy to-wear pieces that still feel special Over the past few seasons the three have gotten closer to that target by sharpening their focus and embracing a new richer vision For their Spring collection they were inspired by the sweet heady feeling of a new relationship Its when you want to feel really pretty but also comfortable Kang explained For example their flowing skirts and dresses had to pass the cross-legged test so you wouldnt think twice about sprawling out on the grass with your special someone Little cutouts and bow-tie details also managed to be feminine but not cloying the same was true of the ballet pink navy white and olive color palette Elsewhere the trio relied on soft textures to inject a sense of romance see the cable-knit sweater paired with a fraying tweed skirt or a crisp strapless poplin tunic layered over silk pants Either of those looks would make an ideal starting point for girls hoping to embrace the seasons breezier less structured sensibilities without going too far outside their comfort zone$$For her Spring 2016 collection Alessandra Facchinetti decided to start a band And not just any band but the Traveling Wilburys of comely young creative talents Fifteen strong personalities who dont follow the rules because they make their own which is why they have such a following said the show notes and among them were Langley Fox Chelsea Tyler Quentin Jones and Elizabeth Jagger some of whom walked in the show some of whom sat front row (All however were present in portrait form via a series of Sonia Sieffshot images which proudly hung in the entryway) Beyond the rules cried the show notes and to that end the proceedings began with a rockabilly strain cropped trousers with paper-bag waists under Cry-Baby quiffs and paper-thin T-shirts that slipped off the shoulder or leather jackets personalized with guitar-themed patchwork Collared shirts had leather detailing and long silk dresses were printed with vinyl records or were not actually silk at all rather delicately perforated pale shades of leather The accessories had attitude too the sinuous wave bag (in an array of sizes with the guitar straps slung over the shoulder or carried in hand) the iconic Gommino loafer here boasting celestial silver adornments safety pins or bedazzled accents A soft sneaker came on occasion fastened with saddlery detail while a standout striped flat in an extended slipper style will prove just the thing for a spot of Im with the band cool when sported with jeans come spring Bag closures and a glossy perfect loafer sported a subtle graphic new logoa pair of gilded Ts with overlapping stems all pure form and linewhich when considering a motif to demonstrate where the house has been and where its going hit just the right note$$A clay-hued backdrop replete with a trio of eerily lit trees set the naturalistic tone at Togas London Fashion Week runway debut Under the banner of Petals Minerals Squiggles designer Yasuko Furuta explored her complex woman with varying degrees of success In line with the chaotic weather patterns of her adopted city of London (and back home in Tokyo) Furuta showed the kind of trans-seasonal daywear that is trending right now Okay so the heavy mesh white coat appliqud with a cascading nude ruffle wouldnt provide much cover in a downpour but it was so pretty Furuta has lost none of her inventive eye for detailing bronze panels of fish-scale sequins and calcified fabrics had a distinct mossy look But occasionally things veered towards the chaoticwith one too many layers or colors on some of the pleated skirts that have become her signature Still there was much to lust after An opulent take on suiting was sublimely inventivewith riding check heavy satin and tailored skirt-fronted tops with a ruffle-edgeworn over tapered trousers These flourishes were Furutas subtle allusion to her theme their shapes borrowed from the blue and yellow blooms in the on-set trees The flowery feel was echoed in the bags toomost memorably on a drawstring mesh number with a petal-shaped red lacquered top A bag for all seasons then made with that complex woman in mind$$Tomas Maier spends part of the year in Miamiits where he opened his first store back in 2004 He knows sunglasses and it shows in the new line of shades hes launching for Spring 2016 Stripped of excesses and more classic than trendy the metal frame and acetate styles are a good metaphor for his brand which stands for elegance and simplicity and prices that dont make your eyes roll back into your head Theres enough of that elsewhere no His aviators and navigators are thin their lenses flush with the frame and very lightweight they look more expensive than their under-$300 tag Maier knows his way around a sundress too Hes got a trio of them in washed linen for Spring their bright pink and red hues slightly faded in parts like souvenirs from a summer holiday Another dress in cotton with a zigzagging tie-dye motif is sure to have you dreaming about your next warm-weather getaway As much as he likes palm trees (theyre printed on a denim dress and flocked in velvet on the hem of a wrap skirt) and the chill laid-back vibes they connote its not all about the seaside at TM Theres a softly tailored suit in poppy red silk this season and knit cardigans in shrunken proportions that city dwellers will snap up And heres something youll be seeing a lot of on the streets next spring the oversize slightly Yves Saint Laurentin-the-seventies proportions of Maiers peasant blouses tucked into full wrap skirts$$Ramon Martin and Ryan Lobo have had some pretty impressive women pinned to Tomes mood board in seasons past including Louise Bourgeois Sylvia Plath and Dorothy Parker to name a few For Spring though their muse the pioneering Australian visual artist Fiona Hall fell a lot closer to home Ryan and I discovered her before we knew each other when we were both in high school said Martin who like his design partner grew up Down Under We saw her latest project at the Venice Biennale recently and immersed ourselves in her work all over again That powerful energy was reflected in the shows casting today The lineup featured unexpected faces such as veteran 90s models Claudia Mason and Esther de Jong More familiar themes came through in the clothes themselves Menswear stripes deconstructed trenchcoats and shirting are fast becoming Tome signatures With Halls thought-provoking sardine can art as a starting point the palette was somewhat subdued for a Spring collection Painterly flourishes did appear in the form of a palm frond print on a lightweight coat with billowing sleeves a leitmotif that was created by an artist friend in the labels Chelsea studio There was an artisanal touch to the fish scale lace panels of one blush pink jacket too and a white lace evening dress came peppered with crystals Overall the voluminous silhouette recalled the exuberance of a particular set of late-70s muses and you could imagine Marie Helvin Jerry Hall or Pat Cleveland swirling on the dance floor of famed Parisian nightclub Le Sept in any of the ruffled peasant skirts and halter tops even if the more layered paper-bag belted looks would be tricky for mere mortals to pull off Still many of the piecesthose charming asymmetrical ruffled blouses in particularwill hold their own in a modern working wardrobe come the spring$$Palm trees sun-soaked beaches rum punch    island life presents what is arguably the most alluring of chill situations Tommy Hilfiger who has been a regular visitor to the isle of Mustique for the past 30 years would know And today he took the fashion world on a mini tropical escape with his Spring 2016 show where the runway was a boardwalk circumscribing a lagoon complete with its own beach-bar shack  Of course its impossible to envision the Caribbean without thinking of its biggest cultural icon Bob Marley Beyond his musical legacy his influence on fashion continues to reverberate If the number of times his face has been printed on a T-shirt were counted in music sale units his image would have gone platinum a thousand times over  There were no Bob shirts on the runway today Instead all the coolest things in his wardrobe were taken apart and redone in a youthful playful way knitted bucket hats in sunny colors mesh vests done as floor-length cover-ups and his signature soccer tracksuit rendered in burgundy suede and finished with crochet insets And speaking of crochet the boho textile was all over the collection including the neckline of patchwork and billowing chiffon dresses The crochet bathing suit that linchpin of a 70s bohemian wardrobe was re-created in several ways too and it was refreshing to see Gigi Hadid a model whose gorgeous womanly body recalls the first wave of free-spirited travelers that came to Jamaica in the late 60s striding down the runway in a string bikini Reason enough to want to run off to a tropical island or at least dress the part until you can$$The front row at Topshop Unique never fails to attract a gaggle of spirited British It girls and today was no different with the likes of Alexa Chung Suki Waterhouse and Poppy Delevingne all in attendance And although the show notes described the muse of the season in vague terms as a beautiful British rebel who is first past the post at any social engagement collectively the pretty young things in the audience embodied that spirit in spades The collection started off with looks that borrowed from the classics of an English gents wardrobeperhaps because certain high-profile tomboys do abide by the motto Theres nothing sexier than a woman in a mans clothing Its why cricket vests were peppered with holes that alluded to the skin cinched with skinny patent leather belts and then layered over jumbo polka-dot skirts or ankle-nipping cigarette pants The oversize pin-striped blazer a city boy favorite was redone as a minidress and worn with huge mismatched earrings while traditional white button-down shirts were toughened up with leather The most convincing pieces in the collection had a gentler sway about them though one that spoke to the soft feminine mood thats in the air overall this season The array of chiffon dressesone of which was covered in a charming strawberry patternhad an innocent garden-party feeling that was anything but fusty With printed lingerie to match the motif of each diaphanous frock the look presented a fresh answer to the naked dress conundrum namely What on earth do you wear underneath it For party girls who just want to have fun what solution could be more appealing than that$$For her Spring 2016 show Tory Burch picked the bright and airy promenade of the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as the location citing beauty found in unexpected places    enhanced through time and nature as her inspiration Her point was underlined by the large oxidized bronze structure that loomed at the rear of the runway Yes Burch seemed to say even in the era of the new and now some things really do get better with age (Even fashion)  And to that end out came some need-it-now spins on the trends of this summer and next Blocky striped knit tops worn with a wide-leg high-waisted trouser embroidered with a design that lay somewhere between an Aztec and a botanical diagram brightly accented narrow guipure lace separates in periwinkle and saffron fringed-tweed wrap skirts tassel-hemmed linen trapeze tops and embroidered folk blouses of Mexican and Romanian origin rendered in pale blue striped cotton shirting All were done in the most utterly Tory way which is to say both pretty and entirely prep-friendly without any of the resulting bloodlessness They were primed for sultry season promenades from Amagansett to the Amalfi Coast paired with pumps and pearls or whatever next must-have sneaker the future has in store (And for the latter remember here comes Tory Sport) The closing section of caftans and skirts in gray perforated leather and iridescent fil coupe organza didnt seem to follow the same trackits hard to imagine them fitting in at East Coast havens like the Siasconset Casino or Maidstone Club But the mod-inspired narrow tunics sported over flowing trousers and shorts (the version in khaki linen burlap edged in crystal embroidery provoking a mild sense of euphoria among showgoers planning future summer party outfits) would be equally successful on a woman of 16 or 60falling fully on the right side of history$$Tracy Reese has been associated with bright retro-tinged floral prints nipped-waist skirts and sparkle for nearly 20 years Shes the kind of designer who wears a tea-length taffeta dress with platform sandals and vintage earrings on a Tuesday afternoon For Spring her clothes were as glam and girly as ever but there was a new deconstructed ease I always love shape but I wanted to find a way to do that without so much structure Reese explained backstage One way she added dimension without hard lines was with layered textures rough-cut swaths of lace over a shimmering slip paper-thin PVC thrown over a brocade shift a nubby linen trench dotted with crystals Shine was a big message this season and the light-catching dance floorready pieces were easily the most exciting Even a boxy sequin T-shirt had more attitude than the boldest most eye-popping print It felt effortless like you could throw it on and get to the party within five minutes flat Prints are Reeses signature but it would be refreshing to see her explore texture and that undone quality a bit further its more in line with what girls want to wear too$$Its a good moment for Pookie Burch and Louisa Burchs Trademark With Alessandro Micheles Gucci the current benchmark of cool the sisters oddball quirk and slightly retro sensibility should find a whole new audience Until now Trademarks Soho outpost has operated as something of an insiders secret the place editors and stylists go for a pair of high-rise floods or a vintage-look sweater We expect the Spring collection with its crinkle patent jacket and skirt its tomato intarsia crewneck and its slightly daffy see-through trench will lure in fans of fashions new nerd-chic look Those of you whove been watching Trademark since its late-2013 launch however will clock a distinct maturity to this lineup Alongside some of the showier pieces there were trim linen shirts an easy-to-wear poplin dress with a micro-pleated sash and smart trousers with subtle slits above the ankles The Burches did cashmere for the first time this season and their tube-trim oversize V necks have a luxe hand They also gave eveningwear a go a taffeta dress with pliss shoulders and a wrap detail at the waist retained the casual polish of their more familiar daywear Speaking of polished the Trademark logo tape on the inside of shirt cuffs was a delicious little detail as were the mini pom-poms tracing the sleeve seams on a pair of boatneck sweaters$$For Spring 2016 Trina Turk left her beloved native Californiaa place that has consistently provided her with inspirational fodderfor a fresh locale across the pond Ive been to Capri a few times over the years said Turk and we realized wed never done a Mediterranean-inspired collection The season begins on the Cte dAzurSaint-Tropezs iconic striped umbrellas inspired a handful of nautical items while Cannes and Cap Ferrat informed some of the more city-appropriate looksbefore traveling down the coast to Italian vacation destinations like Positano and Capri The influence of those seaside spots was apparent in the vibrant color palette and party frocks and beach cover-upsdone up in packable matte jersey and crochetthat had a little dolce vita to them Pants continue to be big for the brand Lace flares silky culottes and printed wide-leg versions provided ample two-legged alternatives for cocktail hour The kick flare has been a huge hit for the label and for Spring it comes in a crop tooa style that was actually part of some of Turks earlier collections and that shes happy to see circle back But the silhouette the designer is most excited about is a twist on the classic caftan dress roomy and scarf-like but with spaghetti straps With the 20th anniversary of the brand behind her Turk is feeling even more confident in the labels core sensibility This season we thought Lets just be more Trina Turk than ever she said That played out in bold floral patterns that mostly wound up on the right side of sixties and seventies kitsch But despite the retro vibe Turk is definitely a woman of the present One print was sourced from contemporary illustrator Lisa Congdon who Turk foundwhere elseon Instagram$$Gaia Trussardi was already deep into her research for this collection when she caught a National Geographic documentary about Australian writer Robyn Davidson During the late 70s Davidson spent nine months traversing Western Australia accompanied only by four camels and a dog (who didnt make it) her ensuing account of the adventure Tracks was a hitthink Wild without the relationship problems It represented the moods and characteristics of a woman I was thinking about said Trussardi The need for a contact with nature How nature can fill you up The result was a collection intended to appear sandblasted wind-whipped and faded by the sun Long-skirted jackets and pleated full pants in neutral striped herringbone linen were left unfinished and tattered at the edges The ribboned bib on a blue shirt was ruffled as if by force Shirtsmore like caftanswere delivered ankle-length split to the hip and worn as layers under jackets or as a piece of outerwear The beaded prints were created from blown-up images of religious tribal masks and the models all wore Virgin Mary necklaces The palette swerved from neutral to pastel with debatable success these rough-hewn heavy-textured loose pieces rather disagreed with the prissiness of soft pink and apricot Trussardi has complained that when it comes to using leather in her collections she is damned if she does (so obvious) and if she doesnt (why didnt she) Today she went with wrap split skirts and a fine raspberry duster jacket in double-layered suede and yellow jerkin-like calfskin crop tops as well as a long gown with a half-moon panel that was cut too narrow to walk easily in The oversize stitching detail on her penultimate look a black suit was a nod to Trussardis glove-making DNA Overall this collection was neither a triumph nor a catastrophe that blue look was pretty good the tailoring fine (cummerbunds apart) and there was plenty to catch the eye of liberal-leaning acai eaters in search of clothes that signal urbane rusticity and luxurious roughness$$At first glance it was hard to believe Tina Lutzs new collection for TSE was inspired by Rastafarians The label is known for golf courseappropriate twin sets after all But Lutz used to frequent Jamaica with her husband where they hung out in the mountains made friends with locals and bonded over jerk chicken and curried goat Its just so different from anything you know she explained Dont expect the typical red green and yellow color palette though Lutzs mood board was covered in photos from Beth Lessers 2008 book Dancehall The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture which documented Rastafarian style in the early 80s Their look was heavy on crisp whites and pastels but it was really all in the details pointelle stitching skinny stripes and clever seam details took sweaters and polos to a much more eccentric place Lutz merged those retro vibes with TSEs complex knit techniques like a pointelle cashmere sweater printed over the top with a custom digital pattern and shot through with feeder stripes Considering TSE is first and foremost a cashmere brand her challenge was to make those knits superlight so you could actually wear them on the beach She also mixed in billowy voile pants crisp shirting and a standout raffia jacket for good measure The jacket felt intentionally raw and unfinished but the hazy stripes were actually sprayed on with an ink jet It summed up TSEs current vision quite succinctly On one hand the brand is artisanal and low-tech with a rich history but it's also completely up to date with modern technology$$For the first time instead of a runway show Tsumori Chisato opted to stage a presentation The cozier format forced her to self-edit and the final cut totaled roughly half what she normally shows This couldnt have been easy for the persistently playful Japanese designer who dives deep into her themes and doesnt resurface until she has exhausted every visual metaphor The underwater world offers no shortage of source material all conducive to Tsumorphing Highlights included an orange neoprene flipper handbag metallic seaweed floating along an organza blouse a blue tent dress bubbling with broderie anglaise and an airy ivory number covered in delicate frond-like forms (bookmark this one if youre planning an offbeat beach wedding) As usual she represented herself in the collection suited up in scuba gear her alter ego paused at the edge of fraying hot pants and swam around the base of a wavy striped maxi dress The oddest depiction showed her delivering a golden eye to a submerged sleeping giant Indeed soaking up these details would have been difficult on the runway either youd focus on the drawings and unique finishings or try to determine whether the clothes were wearablewhich they were Invariably Chisato sticks to simple dress silhouettes easy outerwear and basic shapes that allow the body to breathe (one exception a Grecian-style gown with an unusual drop-waist drawstring) The models paused long enough for the eye to drift downward discovering pearls trapped in clear platforms like Air Max soles embedded with treasures Chisato made sure to point them out to Kenzo Takada who took in the 28 looks by her side He listened intently the entire time smiling as she spun her stories$$Ulla Johnson is the rare contemporary designer whose clothes tell a vivid story but also resonate with real-life customers Her biggest stockist is Barneys New York but the brand is expanding rapidly into top luxury boutiquesplus its all over Instagram which means new shoppers are discovering it every day That commercial success has made it possible for Johnson to really delve into her aesthetic which she describes as a tapestry of cultures That means theres everything from Peruvian ikat prints to Indian embroidery and touches of Western fringe but its all elevated for city-dwelling women like Johnson herself The designer frequently travels to Peru to develop her luxe knitwear but a recent trip to Japan actually made her see the beauty in being home I really just fell in love with America again she explained Theres a huge Japanese market for vintage Levis and bandanas but Johnson opted for a mix of her own nostalgic references macram and crochet details inspired by Santa Fe a color palette of faded rose taupe and marigold sourced from Richard Diebenkorn paintings icy-blue denim seen on wide-leg jeans and a ruffled dress and a pristine white Victorian lace gown Perhaps the collection hung together so well because the clothes felt genuine and familiarweve all owned a peasant dress or chunky cardigan at some point The idea of revisiting those classic piecesupdated with rich textures and more flattering silhouettesfeels just as fresh as trying whatever the brand-new trend is$$Jun Takahashis Undercover collections usually have a message but you dont have to get his deeper meanings to appreciate what he does After his show at the Cirque dHiver today Takahashi talked about righteous aggression The people need to be strong he said His backstage sentiments jibed with a soundtrack that featured a live version of the Rolling Stoness song for the have-nots Salt of the Earth Takahashi came at his insurrectionary message both subtly and less so To start he mashed up jackets and coats with backpacks to give his tailoring a ready-for-battle attitude There were zip-up pockets front and back and on the hips some jackets were so transformed that their fronts were mere straps covering bare breasts It couldve been a silly exercise but Takahashi is a clever tailor with a wicked sense of humor In another sign hes down with the people he co-opted low-culture concert T-shirts for high-fashion purposes The Stoness young faces stared out from inside the four suits of a card deck on a miniskirt and at the hems of pants For every have-not theres a have Takahashi turned playing-card royals into a print on blazers with the kings and queens eyes blacked out like the donts on a dos-and-donts list  Royalty is a motif Takahashi has used before to equally witty effect but the vibe was slightly more incendiary this time around Oversize floral prints couldve been exploding bombs Perhaps not Either way his tweaked and twisted sportswear is easy to get behind$$Russian designer Valentin Yudashkin wanted to take a break from black a decision that could have been motivated by any number of influences outside the fashion realm but probably just boiled down to newness Thing is he does black very well and was finding his groove from a balance of precise tailoring and sexy sportswear Surely some more recently arrived clients might soon be wishing he indulged his darker side a bit longer before pivoting sharply back to color But for all the early-80s evocations Yudashkins focus remained forward He used neoprene and technical mesh inserts to update suiting day dresses and a versatile motorcycle jacket and ornamented eveningwear with acrylic geometric embellishments Yudashkin mentioned being inspired by contemporary art this season and singled out painter Piotr Uklanski as the strongest influence Indeed the drip print that seeped down a jumpsuit or splashed forth in sequins on a hot disco-worthy number nodded directly to the Polish artist However the designer was at his most original when he showed a weightless pastel dress topped with a bouncy neon green blouson this felt fresh and not overworked On the few occasions when he did seem to overwork a designthe final gowns that swirled wildly in a riot of magenta and red taffeta and tullehe did so with the conviction that this represents glamour today If you do it from the heart the customers will follow he said backstage of his vibrant collection He sounded too sincere to object$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking deeply about Africa when they were designing for Spring and not on a whim For more than a year tens of thousands of refugees from Senegal Nigeria Eritrea Mali Gambia and elsewhere have been making the harrowing journey across the Mediterranean to southern Italy Packed into unseaworthy vessels many are dying in appalling circumstances before they reach shore a humanitarian crisis Italy has been dealing with by patrolling the seas saving survivors and giving them sanctuary As in Germany which has been receiving hundreds of thousands fleeing from the war in Syria there has been a backlash against the new arrivals from some quarters And this is what the Valentino designers want to counteract We probably feel that the greatest privilege in doing our work is that fashion can give a message said Chiuri We think every person coming here is an individual and we can show that we can improve ourselves by understanding other cultures The message added Piccioli is tolerance And the beauty that comes out of cross-cultural expression On appearances you would not necessarily guess at the very real and fraught situation running in the background of this serene and heartfelt Valentino collection but the research and the lengths the designers had gone to to educate themselves resulted in some gorgeous fusions between Italian and African traditions They met in the textiles and the way the Roman influences Chiuri and Piccioli had used in their couture show segued into tribal treatmentsthe strips of leather that began as a gladiator reference became studded the Roman sandals gained carved ebony heels the pagan necklaces of their former show now appeared in white ceramic suggesting abstracted teeth or shells and the house expertise in embroidery produced tiny beaded Masai-derived patterns and bold peacock feather trims Both designers pointed out that their respectful borrowings are hardly new they are part of a history of Western assimilation that goes back to Picasso and Braques embrace of African art in the 1920s which Chiuri said was the birth of modernism in art It came over as most modern in this show when it was at its most subtle as in the black dress embellished with multiple layers of suede fringing or in the manipulation of tie-dye patterns used as a camouflage-like material for summer utility jackets and cargo pants In the end though while customers may not even notice the roots of the simple breezy cotton printed Valentino dresses they are buying the important thing is that the designers have used this opportunity to spell out where they stand on an issue very close to home It will definitely be heard in Italy Fashion is a frivolous and joyful thing but that doesnt prevent some of the people who are making it from having inquiring minds and a public conscience$$Vanessa Brunos flagship store had been propped with sleek modular planter boxes and bowls piled with lemons and pomegranates to create a lush ambiance for her South Americaninfluenced collection Never mind the fact that pomegranates originated in the Middle East this outing was less about geographical accuracy than an exploration of artisanal techniques Bruno in fact said she began the season by thinking about a wardrobe for a hot weather getaway and ended up refining the idea so that the clothes would be easily packable without sacrificing style She doubled down on crochet inflecting it with Parisian flair not just in form (a graphic striped bra top) but also in application (paired with crisp gauchos) Dresses eschewed volume for eye-catching finesse from grosgrain detailing to sunset hues Indeed when Bruno pointed to a dress featuring a laced crochet bodice and loosely pleated skirt as being most emblematic of the season one could envision unpacking it along with the raffia sandals and turquoise-accented jewelry and instantly entering into vacation mode As for concerns about the visibly creased cotton which might give the impression of being stuffed carelessly into a suitcase it actually contained a barely visible metal thread that acts as a memory to maintain shape It reinforced how Bruno was going for soign not starched$$Vanessa Seward opened her store on the Rue dAlger last month and from the looks of the crowd at her show today its been a busy place Amid other sightings two high-profile Parisians turned up in the same tweed blazer from her first collection for Fall in identical white jeans and almost identical cashmere sweaters Its puzzling why so few designers put pieces on the runway that could step right off it onto the street Thats why what Sewards doing with her new line is a hit The fantasy is the reality  This afternoons show started with a clever voice-over created by her husband music producer Bertrand Burgalat in which Sewards impressions of French women got the Auto-Tune treatment They have this whole effortless thing that I really admire she says over the electronic music Backstage she added Its my homage to the charm of French women Seward is no slouch in the personal style department of course She had a cosmopolitan upbringing moving first to London and then to Paris from her native Argentina and she imbued her new collection with some of that international flavor cinching Argentine gaucho belts over a couple of dresses and adding a few nods to YSL in Marrakech into the mix The silvery lam was more about time travel back to the glam 70s It looked great on a maxi dress But she didnt shy away from doing smart basics  la APC with whom shes partnered on the label either Seward makes a great trench and there was new denim in the form of an A-line button-front skirt that she paired with a T-shirt that read Vanessas Way Has a nice ring to it doesnt it$$I love the mix between schoolteacher andshowgirl Vera Wang said backstage Theres real life then theres fantasy life Thats potent material theres a reason that Luis BuuelsBelle de Jourwhich was a loose reference point here became the classic it did Indeed dichotomy has long defined Wangs ready-to-wear Masculine and feminine tailoring and flou Shes fashions punk ballerina a world-famous bridal designer who wears only black Duality was again the order of the day for her new Spring collection but the results were somewhat mixed Tailored coats topped only the barest of bandeaux and high-waisted briefs More quizzical was a structured vest that turned to reveal it was a dickey of sorts completely bare in back And the practical applications of a loose V-neck tank cropped below the bust in black mink were hard to discern Wang knows her way around a mash-up but there was a disconnect between her fancy evening dresses and the athletic mesh bras underneath that she never quite resolved Piece by piece she did beautiful work Black ostrich plumes added romance to a sleeveless blazer in nude techno gazar chrome and gold pailletteembroidered dresses were eye-catching and Wang the wedding dress queen cuts a smart pair of high-waisted cropped trousers Reality not fantasy came out on top$$New York Fashion Week is drawing to a close and while weve still got the rest of the month to see collections in London Milan and Paris New York City is where the trends take shape for contemporary labels One major theme for the mid-range set was a simpler more relaxed approach to getting dressed Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard are best known for layering particularly with their sharply tailored jackets and removable dickeys which create the illusion of wearing a cable-knit turtleneck or Perfecto jacket underneath But Spring presented a new focus that goes way beyond blazers Miami was the Beards starting point and models with wet slicked-back hair stood in front of giant palm fronds wearing crisp white separates soft suits and breezy dresses Its supposed to feel like they just jumped out of the pool and threw these clothes on Swanson Beard explained That translated to a looser less rigid approach to tailoring Even the sharpest pin-striped jacket was done in a soft piqu and clingy silk dresses were unstructured save for a drawstring waist or a row of ruched buttons on the side  Of course real-life wearability is a big factor when youre stocked in department stores and while a few looks felt a bit formulaic like a red off-the-shoulder dress others appeared more womanly than what some of the designers peers are doing And for girls looking to upgrade their dickey collection there was a brand-new style to try here lapel dickeys which were slimmer and added just a little extra dimension$$At Veronique Branquinhos Spring 2016 show today at the Htel dvreux models wore long flowing pleated dresses in muted tones of cream black and rainbow pastels (for a Victorian-meetsBurning Man effect) gauzy blindfolds and occasionally trailed macram fringe which extended from the neckline down to the ankle It would not have been a stretch to imagine them with candlesticks in hand too a series of nightgown-clad Lady Macbeths coursing through the halls of the castle with some mind-warping affairs underway There was a fair bit of deconstruction at hand if not actual Shakespearean madness well-tailored jackets and vests with the stitching picked out tasseled sheer layers with visible corsetry underneath an array of utterly bewildering transparently backed trousers exposing long white Elizabethan-style undershorts worn underneath Sheer tulle blouses possessed vaguely modesty-protecting ruffles on the breast while suit trousers occasionally boasted a thick white elastic waistband printed with the designers name  la 80s Calvin Klein A medieval-looking print of flora and fauna was pleated on some frocks to expose the bounty when the dress was in movement but most successful were the shoes chunkily heeled brogues and smoking slippers with gently sloping toes in black and shagreen red lizard and creamy white patent$$If Vronique Leroys program notes told one storyan intellectual young woman defining sexy on her own termsthe designer told another backstage after the show For Spring she tried to test the point at which seemingly mismatched outfits gain new allure She did this primarily by pushing and pulling colors proportions and materials just enough that the outcome remained a tad shy of awry Look 13 is a prime example the crinkly white and sky blue striped silk blouson and wrap skirt paired with a black camisole and saffron belt strikes as simultaneously fresh and odd The final passage made the same impact as if the rounded sleeves wide pants and mix of check knit mesh and lace delivered the sartorial equivalent of a jolie laide One imagines that Leroy spent much time calibrating the elements whether at an early design stage or the very end in styling But the coquettish black dress that repeated the same mix of mesh and lace was the opposite of overthought A long-sleeved version in white and navy turned the trusty marinire into something to lust after For all the possible traps Leroy really only slipped up with the accessories (wide asymmetric belts oversize droopy hoops openwork booties) which werent problematic in design as much as overusedalthough maybe this was part of the exercise And by the end it became clear that the low-key professional women who have supported her for decades would not need to opt into this mismatched business to find their key looks But if they feel compelled to venture slightly outside their comfort zone Leroy has them covered$$Just when you're feeling down and a little bit battered and numbed by fashion in general and perhaps thinking you've lost sight of the point of it all along comes Donatella Versace to put it to rights Before we start talking about the way her collection grabbed so many women in parts of themselves they never imagined Versace could reacheven those who like a boyish pant suit and flatswe should refer you to her soundtrack It was not just an added-on musical theme but the massively inclusive confidence-generating Transition by Violet and friends You'll have to listen to it but long story short It's a call to all women to stop listening to our inner demons and outer detractors and just get rid of everything which stops us from doing what we really want It was made for International Women's Day said Donatella Versace backstage And when I heard it I was so sure of myself I wanted to challenge myself to do something strong  Which is surely the main reason she came up with the image of combat which marched through her showa reflection of the all-too-many wars which are raging now maybe but also of the resolution of her battle with herself to throw away self-imposed restraints and just get on with making Versace relevant  Relevant We must now move toward thinking about what that oft-repeated never-defined and rather terrifying word means Perhaps relevance is emotionally felt in fashion when its clear that its not just for one type of very thin very young white girl when it also represents on behalf of color booty and admirable women who are just a weensy bit more experienced than eighteen And apart from that When it comes to design relevance in fashion also relates to where on earth the clothes are actually supposed to be worn Can many people find things to put on daily Or are we all going to continue to believe in the fiction that living in today's world is one long cocktail reception Donatella Versace addressed all that by showing a collection which never ditched the beloved character of her family's house but concentrated mostly on varying shades of daywear shown on an inclusive cast of characters The opening looks all legs with khaki tailored jackets cinched with webbing belts over micro shorts above vertiginous platforms were no surprise What came next was The Versace house print gone wild in punchy green camouflage tailored suits with slouchy boy-cut pants collaged into knits and sweatshirts and swinging along in the form of backpacksall (amaze) walking out on clogs and sporty slides  It would not be Versace without an injection of sexinessa quality which has been so out of fashion recently that many designers appear terrified of it This time Donatella Versace did show some of the requisite chiffon fluttery spilt-to-the-thigh gowns but the little curvy slashed and knotted dresses which came before them were far more interesting shown as they were on girls striding out on what amounted to decorated clogs It was a triumph which turned boredom into excitement and alienation into a visceral desire to shop Whatever forces Donatella Versace was fighting to reach this new point of clarity she won$$As of now Versus Versace as you see it here is already on sale onlineeven as the after-party with the models and invited kids from far and wide is still going on in a basement venue in London With Anthony Vaccarello at the helm as creative director Donatella Versace has turned Versus into a show-now buy-now wear-tomorrow collection a shortcut to fashion availability which no one else in the designer world has yet quite fully pulled off  But what will people be clicking on to purchase when they wake up tomorrow Interesting to speculate Vacarello is a fluent new-generation-channeler of the pulse of Versace He gets the house codesthe lion-head medallions the legginess the body-conscious cutout-and-drape shapes the tailoring One thing he has not yet delved into is the color of Versacehes a confirmed fan of black in his own collection and that hue dominated the Versus runway too However for the first time there were prints botanical florals and fruit patterns plus such things as printed denim bomber jackets and jeans It made for an impressively wide range for people all over the world to pick from and plenty of opportunity for stocking up ahead of year-end parties Still in fashion the eye always tends to go toward the outliers In this case that would be the simplest daywear look a black leather shirt over tailored hip-riding masculine pants Maybe thats about as far from a stereotypical Versace look as can be imaginedand it stood out in a good way Meanwhile who should be wearing something very similar backstage Why Donatella herself in a narrow pair of black boy-pants and a black T-shirt Surprise$$The entity that goes under the name Vetements has caused quite a quake through fashionbottom-up from nowhere Just whenby looking at mainstream corporate luxury-goods normsit seemed that cool was dead and buried and nothing alternative could ever again survive along came a couple of brothers Demna and Guram Gvasalia and their collective of friends to prove skeptics wrong Theres no faking the concrete truth of that The visible evidence of their breakout is in the number of Vetements oversized blazers and giant MA-1 jackets recycled firefighter sweaters Antwerpen slogan shirts and especially the flower-printed tea dresses with sweatshirting inserts that are being worn around the shows Nobody seems to have consulted each other on this They just went to shops women and men alike tried on the Vetements stuff loved the way it made them look and feel and impulsively paid up Thats why those impulsive ones plus a large contingent of the professionally curious enthusiastically headed to Belleville today to what turned out to be a large Chinese restaurant to see the Vetements follow-up for Spring The audience was not to be disappointed The buzz and energy in that cheap and cheerful establishment the freakishly beautiful club of the young and the strong who modeled and the wildly impressive clothes they were wearing had all the makings of an unforgettable fashion landmark At top speedDemna Gvasalia and his co-conspirators confirmed everything their following likes about their off-kilter elegant giant-jacketed tailoring and clunky romantic dresses and then bettered it all There were argyle knits under sober menswear suits sexy sawn-off skirts with Vetements-labeled thigh boots under coats brilliant flashes of neon yellow and toxic green striped mens shirts with superlong trailing cuffs and corset T-shirts Then came the dresses in a stunning number of new colorful and punchy-sophisticated ideas There were loose versions of prairie-flower prints with matching trailing coats a green Lurex yoked smock a navy polka-dot dress anchored on a black satin slip and one outstanding mauve velvet dress cut to cling and slither across the body And that was far from all After most of the crowd had filtered out into the streets Demna Gvasalia explained Theres something in the collection which means a lot to everyone whos worked on itlike those rose-printed plastic tablecloths we made into aprons and dresses were an ode to my grandmother Weve worked really hard on developing more jeans too and leather The point is that the Vetements collective has a lot of pooled talent and experience to call upon Idealistic as they are they havent started as naive lambs to the slaughter of the industry One core ally is the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova Adam who walked last in the show Other people have worked silently with them moonlighting from jobs elsewhere Demna Gvasalia himself learned the ropes at Maison Martin Margiela before setting up Vetements and getting on with proving that there can be a different way of doing things Apart from their stylistic insights into what people really want to wear it feels like the beginning of something else tooperhaps something like the power of niceness and friendship in an industry that could do with a lot more of that$$Perhaps more than ever tonights VFiles show pushed fashion decency to its very limit then went further In front of an adoring rambunctious crowd of colorfully attired demimonde-dwellers bobbing to dubstep courtesy of DJ A-Trak not to mention all who watched on Periscope and tweeted furiously five young designers or collectives took the runway with abandon They were the chosen ones as selected online by an international voting public Were breaking stereotypes said founder Julie-Anne Quay backstage These brave kids who are 22 and under represent the next generation of tastemakers the new youth culture The most compelling of the bunch conceptually speaking was Feng Chen Wang Born in Beijing and fresh out of fashion college in Britain she described the very somber basis for her collection learning of her fathers cancer diagnosis last year and taking a deep interest in the process of recovery even observing the surgery firsthand in the operating room As bleak as it sounds and rather contrary to her chirpy demeanor she made the most of the bad situation crafting clothes bursting with outsized organ shapes and zippers evoking incisions Some models wore blood bags that dripped a black liquid (not blood) into plastic tubes spelling out the words Love and Life David Ferreira based in London brought together his favorite film Orlando and Empress Dowager Cixi of nineteenth-century China As it happened some of the pieces ended up looking remarkably similar to Rihannas yellow stunner by Guo Pei at this years Met Gala (Incidentally Rihanna has sported previous VFiles designers to various events) Ferreira said he combined elements of European couture with historical Chinese dress He mentioned foot-binding but it was surely only coincidence that one model tumbled twice ripping off her shoes each time and continuing barefoot to thunderous applause  Design duo Namilia (Nan Li and Emilia Pfohl) sent out elaborate inflatables spanning the entire width of the runway and covered in naughty words and symbolsall highly unwearable to be sure but also very entertaining and well received Backstage they cited the power of Instagram and the rebellious spirit of todays pop stars The New York trio Moses Gauntlett Cheng was the most trans-centric of the group mixing and matching assorted genders and identities that along with a self-assured sashay recalled the 80s drag balls from the film Paris Is Burning Japanese designerand graduate of both Central Saint Martins and ParsonsKozaburo Akasaka also sought inspiration from an earlier decade but his was conjured from the other side of the planet Tokyo His pieces were hand-stitched and patched together from scraps of denim leather and other assorted tatters complete with cowboy boots One imagines his post-apocalyptic Wild West vision was all the rage in his hometown at the end of the last millennium When the grand finale took placea parade of all the models in all the looksthe effect was nothing short of Fellini-esque And get this Most of it either already is or will soon be available to buy online It really is a new day$$However I touch things they always look very polished I just cant help it So noted comeback kid Victor Alfaro after his show today and indeed the collection he presented proved his point The greatest part of the appeal of these clothes was their immaculateness discovered in the perfect body-skimming fit of a bias-cut silk gown or the piping detail on a white cotton jumpsuit or of course in any of Alfaros signature knits Of the latter the most eye-catching pieces were the dressy sweaters embellished with ribbon embroidery or dangling bugle beads or patchworked together with lace the items that stuck with you however were the ones that summoned a more monumental effect Alfaro has a talent for the statuesque which he deployed here in (seemingly) simple silk gowns with graphic windowpane insets terrific long-line jumpsuits and likewise lean cashmere gilets and various voluminous pants Tee-shaped dresses and quilted cargo pants introduced a sportier tone but they still had a certain Georgia OKeeffe-wandering-the-New-Mexico-desert vibe one that was ramified by garments such as a floor-length knit cape (Ellsworth Kelly meanwhile provided the punch of yellow and orange in the collections palette) The aura of self-possession in Alfaros clothes will alongside his knits remake his name in timethis 90s wunderkind seems to be taking the long view and making clothes not so much for this or any particular moment but ones built to last$$Im a sponge That might seem a very odd existential quote to come from the mouth of the distinctly un-blob-like Victoria Beckham but she was using it as a figure of speech to account for the design ideas she put into her Spring collectionfeelings she says she just picked up in passing on her nonstop travels with work and family Ive lived in LA we have the show here in New York and now obviously were back in London she said backstage so I guess Ive figured it out from that There are subliminal things in here like the surf prints but this collection is more about attitude and just making things fresh and carefree Perhaps the best way to judge Beckhams fluid just-above-the-ankle midi lengths swing dresses and flats is to compare them to what she was producing at the very beginning of her career as a designer ie fitted hourglass silhouettes tiny short dresses and eveningwear all with towering heels That is now firmly a thing of the past There was nothing on the runway that looked even remotely cocktail or red carpet in the old sense but times have changed Where there once might have been sculpted corseted bustiers now there is crinkled duchesse satin suspended from gathered necklines and where once there had been stiletto platforms here were backless loafers The distance traveled can definitely be measured in a much more grown-up idea of what sophisticated fashion is to the kind of women who inhabit or would like to move into Victoria Beckhams world The clothes read as expensive with a luxurious creamy heft and swish about them exuding a wealthy confidence that says I have achieved the perfect life but I dont need to try too hard to show that off to you$$With her second flagship store set to open its doors in Hong Kong Victoria Beckham finds herself at the helm of a brand thats an increasingly global proposition Still after hosting a dinner for London Fashion Week (and a quick call to check in on her kids) she found time to walk through the Spring 2016 offerings from her little sister line Victoria Victoria Beckham It started when we were in Marrakech for Davids birthday she said of the springboard for this season We visited the Jardin Majorelle and I was really inspired by all the tiles and the color This theme was most pronounced in the signature Majorelle Blue bloom prints that had the edifying effect of Matisses cutouts These folksy florals were reworked more delicately in off-white lace on a simple crepe shift and a neat macram sweater A laser-cut dress in intense orange delivered a kaleidoscopic kick with a level of detailing that had a mainline finish The silhouette was largely loose and relaxed with voluminous-backed cape dresses that chimed with the brands playful modern tone Ive been wearing this huge gray dress all around New York said Beckham of the starting point for these billowing shapes It felt so summery and light It made me realize that wearing volume really can be flattering Merging VVB with her denim line last season has apparently brought out Beckhams experimental side Weve pushed the denim with more techniques cuts and washes she said pointing to a pair of eyelet-flecked white tapered jeans Among these new shapes were some frayed-hem culottes complete with a belt that are sure to be on summer wish lists Happily there was still space in the collection for her best-selling flares and skinnys  The real draw here for VVBs younger customer is in the expanded presence of entry-level pieces A delicious series of T-shirts some contenders for eveningwear echoed the primary palette with leather or fuzzy-felt finish flowers Im excited about the T-shirts said the designer eyeing a white tee with contrast black collar in an oversize pop print Theyre a chance to reach out to people of varying budgets I want all women to be able to experience the brand$$A collection starring crochet and pleated slacks might intimidate all but the most intrepid fashion enthusiast (retailers included) But leave it to Russian designer Vika Gazinskaya to turn challenging ideas into charming clothes She did this by stripping away the corresponding clichs Her Spring outing was neither stuck in the 80s nor weighed down with craft Rather she relied on brushed cotton and crisp silk as her two blank slates from which to experiment with volume color and the placement of colorful appliqus some backed with functioning pockets Its just too bad that the collection is handicapped by photos that flatten the dimension of her ample silhouettes and fail to capture the humble appeal of the crochet (the flower placket and two-tone scalloped hem among the standouts) Photos also dont do justice to the rigor of Gazinskayas constructionthose sculpturally fronted tops and feminine trenches do not assume their shapes by accident Fortunately she has a sixth styling sense aware that pairing the trousers with an embellished T-shirt or silk camisole is as important at entry level (price and aesthetic) as the crochet bib over the folksy dress is at the advanced Gazinskaya remains her own most convincing muse so it will be interesting to see how soon she wears Look 6 with its odd color pairing of chocolate and peanut butter In the meantime toward the end of the walk-through she lifted up a full skirt to expose a crinoline Also under there her enduring joie de vivre$$Adventuress is a deliciously double-edged title that was used in 19th- and early-20th-century England to describe invariably hot women who were outside the bounds of society and apparently set on their insertion into it From the niggles titters and whispers that Goga Ashkenazithe commodities-pumped proprietor of Vionnetsometimes attracts one suspects that a century ago she would have been labeled an adventuress Today though it seems like what it is snobbery pure and simple  Ashkenazis project at Vionnet is sincere if sometimes touched by naivety Today fueled by the insertion of Hussein Chalayan into her team she presented a collection that convincingly tipped its hat to Madame Vionnet herselfcheck Pinterest yallplus incorporated Vionnets own classical source code Beneath the breathy wind of mood-board romanticismspanning from Peter Doigs canoe paintings to Byrons She Walks in Beautythis collection was at its essence a group of bias-cut shades-of-nude column dresses with flanks of pliss and sometimes iffy paneling jazzed up with odd handmaiden flying buttresses weighed down by sewn-in stones There were unfortunate diversions A sheer paneled black dress featured a crisscross of relief cutely taken from an upskirt photograph of the Eiffel Tower but it was still a too-sheer black dress But the sublimations of Doric relief and go-to nymph adornment onto half-caped trouser suits with sneaker-meets-gladiator sandals represented the whisper of a Platonically touched ideal spanning then and now Titter ye not Vionnet is okay$$Its always a head-spinning experience to go through a new Visvim collection with its designer Hiroki Nakamura Not only are his collections sprawling encompassing mens as well as a newer womens line (WMV) but most pieces have unusual and distinct origins that beg to be told and heard And Nakamura a gifted raconteur is more than happy to share their stories Essentially Visvim begins and ends with vintage fabric But heres the thing Nothing is actually vintage Rather each piece is created anew in the spirit of vintage usually the result of a long and international chain of artisanal workmanship Nakamura described how for example one sweater began as organic Italian cotton which was then hand-knitted in Peru before being finished in France There were also mens shoes woven out of bits of raffia in Morocco but which because the craftsmen there werent experienced with a particular shade of blue required a team of Japanese dye specialists to assist Dyeing is otherwise done in Japan as a rule as in a series of lightweight cotton dresses with an all-over checkerboard pattern made by brushing dye over rice resin in a technique called katazome That innocuous-looking plaid suit jacket Its made entirely out of paper pulp for extra breathability Aside from his obsession with vintage fabrics Nakamura is also a collector of found objects or flea-market finds things he picks up on his travels and packs into the five or six suitcases he says he takes with him on every trip He assembled a display of these items for the showing today a jar of shells he found on a beach in Montauk that he drew as a shell print for the collection a parasol from Alsace that inspired him to make an indigo-dyed umbrella a jewelry box from the 1900s that he liked for its brass studs Geta slippers whose once-bright velvet faded long ago On the topic of shoesupon which the company was founded and which still whip up enormous cult-like zealsome important news first a new sneaker style called the Roland Jogger is launching and second the famed FBT moccasin that started it all now comes with a protective leather overlay by popular demand$$Vivienne Tam built her business on lavish evening gowns that fuse her Chinese heritage with modern technology but todays show threw a wrench in that formula Spring was all about casual streetwise clothes for both girls and guys it was Tams first time casting male models in her show Traveling between New York Hong Kong and Paris I noticed people on the streets were very androgynous Tam explained before the show Girls were wearing mens clothes and men were wearing more feminine things Sure you could chalk it up to the impact Hari Nef Andreja Pejic and (most famously) Caitlyn Jenner have had on pop culture this year But transgender isnt a trend and Tam included lots of additional context too like the oft-referenced Chinese Art Deco period which saw women playing with masculine style for the first time  The show opened with a relaxed strapless gray striped ensemble that captured Tams new laid-back approach It was closely followed by a few different takes on shirting like a flouncy wrap dress and a mens charcoal jumpsuit with a ruffle down the front A lot of the best pieces however were the ones that could pass for unisex like the satin souvenir jacketsalready a big trend for falland tech-mesh bombers For the red carpet Tam showed playful mahjong-inspired dresses that were undeniably fun the game was introduced in the US during the Art Deco period Intricate dresses with embroidered rows of tiles felt whimsical but still a lot more restrained than the gilded heavily embellished dresses Tam showed in the past$$Can you reasonably rage against the machine when you are a highly profitable cog in it This is an obvious paradox inherent in Dame Vivienne Westwoods policy of using her shows as a podium from which to preach about the iniquities of mass consumerism and fossil fuel dependence Her valiant pitch at squaring that circle is the exhortation to buy less things that are better made and last longer a sentiment that while impossible to disagree with doesnt quite carry when delivered in the backstage hubbub immediately before a show of seasonal fashion Nonetheless this evenings Vivienne Westwood Red Label carnival was a corker Held in a basement space grippingly advertised outside as an Alien Sex Club the runway was overlooked by a balcony on which gathered a band of paper-crowned model/protestors holding banners hostile to politicians and shale gas extraction The soundtrack was quite frankly hellisha cacophony of sirens and garble through which occasionally stirring dialogue could be heard including the weary line Fashion is ridiculous a pathetic parody of what it used to be After the last look walked the protesters descended behind Westwood Everyone in the room dutifully took pictures then realized they had no signal The most piquant contradiction in this show was how incompatible the collection seemed with the rhetoric around it Because while the styling was absolutely maverickall smeared robber-mask eyes and sleep-in-a-tree hairthere is no other way to describe the clothes than with the C-word conservative Prettily ruched frocksfrocksin lace came layered with sweet scarlet florals Knee-length tea dresses were delicately cut and spattered with Marimekko-touched patterns Layered embroideries in manor-house interior reliefs were layered around their wearers like professionally piped icing Yes there was the odd proselytizing button or T-shirt emblazoned with a meaningful carbon footprint but subtract theseand perhaps alter some of the more laissez-bare necklinesand you could imagine the Duchess of Cambridge or Samantha Cameron appropriately shaking hands with the CEO of Shell in a great many of these looks It was as if the Sex Pistols were covering Maroon 5and it was good$$Vivienne Westwood has made a habit of using her fashion shows as a platform for activism This season she was championing two related causes In a note left for attendees at their seats she invited them to join her at the Peoples March for Climate Justice and Jobs in London on November 29 just ahead of the start of the Paris climate talks On the runway meanwhile she paid homage to Venice a city that perhaps due to climate change is sinking even faster than it was before Venice is a good theme for Westwoodher shows tend to have a certain carnival atmosphere in their mix of the decadent and the louche Youd have expected a Vivienne Westwood Save Venice collection to feature quite a few of her signature evening dresses with their bouffant skirts and baroque swirls of sculptural draping But Westwood took another tack Instead of cocktail looks she emphasized rather plainspoken daywear silhouettes shown on male as well as female models in a gesture that read less political than as an homage to the Venetian tradition of the masque The cross-dressing theme was echoed as well in the array of tailored items in particular suits that looked oversize and mannish with trousers cut to appear as though theyd been cinched up spontaneously to fit a womans smaller frame That was one of Westwoods dramatic flourishes others included poufed sleeves and hardware and crystal embellishment sewn onto jackets As far as theatrics went however Westwood saved her fire for a few spectacular pieces such as the extra-long coats worn high overhead which created a spookily huge silhouette and a bodysuit of sequin-dripping net that conjured a very fancy birdcage Needless to say those looks had quite an impact on the runway But the strongest ones at todays show were much more straightforwardWestwood still drapes a mean dress and her fluid silk frocks bunched artfully in the front made for a fine addition to her substantial oeuvre They were dressy those dresses but had such a casual mien that you could imagine wearing one to march alongside the designer in London next month$$Are you a good witch or a bad witch And furthermore who cares about that old adage when Wendy Nichol keeps making clothes that so neatly and lushly encompass both For Spring the accessories-maven-cum-cult-ready-to-wear-favorite has struck on her most winning balance since debuting her clothes back in 2011 If threads of Victoriana once were a chief characteristic of her offerings then recent seasons have seen the scales tip toward a more general more languid sort of loveliness Even the pieces marked most starkly by a sense of drama were easy to envision as appealing to many different types of bewitching women Nichols floor-grazing collarless duster for example is beloved by everyone from Beyonc to Saudi princesses and here came in a lustrous shadow-striped ivory silk with a leather tasseled belt Elsewhere a showstopping Solstiss lace gown and generously fringed bustier in buttery black leather looked like you might just run the world in them Still not all of us clock in as royalty of one sort or another on the day-to-day so Nichol has savvily begun rounding out her offerings with more traditionally wearable separates See a pair of wide-leg pants complete with a wafting overlay of chiffon or a cropped tank top and tee The designers impeccable fabrications all whipped up in her New York studio lend even those simplest of styles (including her utterly louche bias-cut skinny scarves) a feeling thats markedly special Best was a softly pleated circle skirt in pieced-togethernot printedblack and white stripes All inky at first glance but take a step back and it flashed a snowy-white undersidea bit naughty and very very nice$$Wes Gordon is one of a handful of young designers who have found themselves in a tricky position vis--vis their clientele Gordon serves what once was known as an uptown customerexcept that those women are just as likely these days to be found downtown or evenheavens to Betsyin Brooklyn and their shifting sense of style reflects the change in geography They want clothes that are luxurious and polished and feminine and that will serve at the formal occasions they are called upon to attend but they also want clothes that are functional and unfussy with a dont-mess-with-me attitude and perhaps a hint of the offbeat This is a difficult brief Gordon for his part fulfilled it capably last season finding ways to elevate a grungy vibe without losing track of its essential brooding spirit   This time out Gordon took a similar tack The silhouettes were girlier and the palette less moody and imposingthis was a Spring collection after allbut the grunge inflection remained firmly in place Gordon noted that he had photos of ultimate slacker girl-crush Winona Ryder posted up all over his studio as he prepped this collectionand at moments in looks like the silk or plaid cotton dresses with stripes of cobwebby lace sewn on in seemingly amateurish fashion he did summon Ryders characteristic demure dishevelment Elsewhere the message was more muddled There were great seam-detailed looks done in matter-of-fact charcoal linen and need-it-now marled knits which when paired with the buttery calfskin pieces provided the collection with much of its warmth There were other nice touches too like the tunics with cutout shoulders or the flourishes of iridescent chiffon Overall though Gordons effort this season to fuse upscale and edge led him down too many byways and the collection never really came into focus It could have used fewer stories better told$$Colors and prints tend to have a short lifespan in the fashion cycle so when they happen to be your signatures keeping them fresh is key One way Whit designer Whitney Pozgay manages to do that each season is by enlisting artists to collaborate on her prints from New York artist Adam Handler to her own husband Parker Argote who has painted many of her signature motifs over the years The final results are crafty and eclectic not trendy or loud (read no digital prints here) For Spring Pozgay wanted to illustrate the contrast of hot air balloons over the African savannahan image packed with opposites like hard and soft artificial and natural old and new Striking shades of poppy and lemon popped against ivory sand and black on straight midi skirts boxy shift dresses and off-the-shoulder blouses many of which were stamped with a series of tribal prints Each one was handmade like the blocky geometric print that was initially laid out with sport tape or the sweet slightly retro African lily print We wanted to reappropriate the tribal theme in a more artful way Pozgay explained She tapped Handlerwho recently showed his work at the Fred Torres Galleryto paint a giraffe across the entire front of a crisp shirtdress  Elsewhere the idea of tribal clothing was subtler and in some ways already engrained in the Whit vernacular Mixed prints wrap details and voluminous shapes are hallmarks of traditional African style but theyre also the elements Pozgay always goes back to Its all the things we love mashed together she said Its crisp and wearable and there are plays on proportion like bell sleeves with a skinny skirt but its still forward and fun$$Ruffian designers Brian Wolk and Claude Morais packed up the car for Los Angeles a year and a half ago part of the wave of westward-leaning New Yorkers Last night they presented their second collection for their new eponymous label Wolk Morais in West Hollywood and the show was a testament to how quickly theyve taken to their adopted home and put down roots Elizabeth Stewart who dresses Cate Blanchett Amanda Seyfried Julia Roberts and other celebs styled the show and her teenaged kids and their friends not only modeled in it but also inspired the clothes  Back in New York City Wolk and Morais used to be known for ladylike flounces and frills and couture-level fabrications Theyve rejiggered the formula at their new label with raw denim utility jumpsuits and sweatshirts and an occasional pair of tights for the guys who walked the show This is the right move for them Fashion is headed in a looser less-fancy direction at the moment for one and for another the raw denim looked really good especially a jumper-dress worn over a silk blouse Elsewhere Wolk and Morais had fun with print creating a digitized floral that turned up small and large on everything from those hoodie sweatshirts to cocktail numbers and event dresses They didnt leave their dressy instincts entirely behind when they left New York That makes sense too There are too many starlets and red carpets to count in their new hometown With Stewart for a fairy godmother as they call her some of those up-and-coming actresses and perhaps some very-well-established ones too could find their way into Wolk Moraiss frocks From there its not far into stores$$The idea of the outsider looking in has always fascinated Yang Li a designer whose rise to the upper echelons of Paris fashion came via Beijing Perth Australia London and Antwerp Its surprising then to note that his Spring heroine isnt concerned with the divide of East versus West but rather a more fictive trip down memory lanethat of a punk in exile returning to her bourgeois past prompted to scour her grandmothers closet and piece together a new identity That romantic metamorphosis unfolded from the get-go as Look 1 was comprised of a delicate jacquard bra top and an organza-trained cream trenchcoat that topped mannish pants and monk-strap derbies It immediately engaged a sensual rub of mid-century prettiness with Lis codes of postpunk music sharp tailoring and tough unfinished eveningwear What followed was a repetitive expansion of that framework as the designer riffed on generous pant volumes fluid-sliced camisoles and polo tops and the jarring grunge effect of silk gingham layered with leather coats or ball skirts cut in crimson inkblot florals Though a trio of patchwork tailored coats recalled Lis time under Raf Simons in Antwerp he twisted their familiarity with an artisanal touch as bold lyrics by the neo-folk group Swans were traced in hand-stitched gothic calligraphy Like an intuitive balancing act their demure counterparts followed suitsack-back bracelet-sleeved opera coats in duchesse satin or taffetacouture-like creations that held their own among the complexity of viscose trenchcoats or tailored boucl jackets peeling open with sinuous zips Sprinkled throughout the belts of those trenches were worn as fetishist buckle scarvesclasped at the neck with silver brooches picked out in studs and sprays of flora They were the totems of youth and establishment cast side by side with arresting irreverent beauty$$Kanye West only confirmed he was putting on a show last Saturday when his invitations went out but save for his friend Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy presentation Yeezy was the event of the week Outside beforehand camera phonewielding fans swarmed the VIP door angling for a picture of Drake Lorde and Jaden Smith Just as many people were trying to scoot past security without a ticket at the main entrance Once inside the setting was comparatively serene but only until those celebrities and the designers familyKim North Khlo Kourtney and Kendallstarted to take their front row seats from then on it was pretty much pandemonium  West worked with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft for the second season going Like last time street-cast models mixed with professional ones and Kylie Jenner the designers sister-in-law put in a cameo Unlike last time West and Beecroft made the military metaphor literal enlisting real drill sergeants who called out formations Platinum-blond fair-skinned models came first and marched to the end of the runway to pose for pictures As the show progressed the clothes shaded from beiges and taupes to browns and blacks and the models hair and skin tone got darker with the darkest models and clothing coming last At the finale they arrayed themselves front to back white to black In a year in which racial injustice has occupied the headlines it was a potent tableau seemingly loaded with meaning But if West was making a statement about inequality in America he chose not to address it with this reporter When asked about the casting he said Its just a painting just using clothing as a canvas of proportion and color   Were not sure if we buy that but if West wants to put the focus on his fashion not his politics then well play along The Yeezy vibe is a consistent one Sweatshirts leggings outerwear and boots remain the backbone of the collection Its still monochrome head-to-toe and its still essentially unisex Spring does feel less shaggy than its predecessor but its just as streetwise If West makes good on his promise at the VMAs last month and does indeed run for President in 2020 hes going to have to get his campaign trail suits somewhere else$$Math isnt one of the things you hear fashion editors talk about while they wait for runway shows to start (Were right-brained people) But Yeohlee Teng likes to think about numbers and geometry when she designs her clothes At first glance Tengs Spring collection was as simple as it getsall button-down shirts scoop-neck T-shirt dresses and pencil skirtsbut most pieces were designed with equations in mind Pockets were placed in perfect 6-by-6-inch squares and a spongy bonded wool coat was cut from a giant circle The models even stood on a 36-by-36-by-12-inch platform in the middle of her tucked-away 29th Street store  Teng also considered how clothes fill up the negative space around the bodysee the rounded ecru coat with pouf sleeves which concealed the models every curve or the sheer filigree shirts which seemed to take up no space at all Of course the average shopper likely wont consider those factors when she grabs a Yeohlee parka off the rack but the emphasis on numbers and form did lend a sense of order to the designers sometimes vague aesthetic$$Its about going from step to step said Yigal Azroul of Spring and showing that progression What came of this transient mind-set was a collection that started with light (a transparent silk-twill dress with printed brushstrokes) and bowed with dramasee the all-black finale knockout with jabot lacing neck to navel Yet despite the range Azroul managed to keep his trademark cool by making sure his silhouettes never veered too far afield these clothes all have appeal and widespread at that The best piece here was a motorcycle jacket that fell somewhere in the middle of Azrouls evolutionary story its body rendered in thick architectural leather and its sleeves spun of misty chiffon embroidered with sprigs and ferns Smart and effortless with a spin Later Azroul tried colorful floral appliqus over jet lace but he was strongest when keeping the concept simpler A black-and-white guipure turtleneck turned heads and any number of PYTs might find wardrobe bliss in a little dove-gray jacket and steely filigree dress The teal and black dresses were also eye-catchingAzroul mentioned he could see Gwyneth Paltrow wearing one (Agreed) With a clean matte beauty look (slicked-backed ponies and the faintest breath of blush) this was a pleasant evolution indeed$$To witness a Yohji Yamamoto creation make its way down the runway is to wonder whether he arrived at it by accident or by deliberate design Likewise the show itself which today took place in the gloriously gilded gallery at City Hall where the acoustics amplified the silence between what may or may not have been a live music performance Turns out Yamamoto supplied the recording a one-man-jam that consisted of him singing Come into the shadows  Backstage he confirmed that the improvisational styling of the wrapped knotted and displaced looks that set the shows tone was very much on purpose Each time you wear its different he explained The clothes were also different in that he wasnt suffocating the models with an impenetrable concept Gradually however he switched into a higher historical gear hoop skirts seemed like theyd survived a tornado and excess fabric spilled out from the tops of corsets The denim tubes assembled into a skirt were Yamamotos interpretation of an 18th century crinoline that he found in a rare book on European lingerie Only someone capable of reading Yamamotos mind would have connected the dots between these exquisitely tattered looks the makeshift parasols and the all-terrain Adidas sneaker boots to arrive at his stance on climate change Earth is angry the summer is too hot and the rain becomes a storm And in hot times we need underwear in the streets he said Environmental message aside the cumulative effect was a collection that skewed cool This Yamamoto declared was also intentional My brand needs young customers At midnight he will turn 72 years young which likely explains the invitation boasting a photo of his aging hands The girl who closed the show wearing a stiffly ruffled roughed-up dress in fire engine red was equipped with a camera as part of a documentary being made about the designer Yamamoto bearing all seems unimaginable he communicates via rogue corset boning randomly painted pantaloons and shapeless shrouds But then this momenta genuine resurgencewont last forever$$Its been a big week for Zac Posen First came his diffusion line presentation which featured an LED dress he made in partnership with Google After that his debut collection for Brooks Brothers Tonight in front of Amy Schumer Christina Hendricks Jennifer Hudson and Bella Thorne he took over Grand Centrals Vanderbilt Hall with a signature collection that was surprisingly free of many of his signatures Beforehand Posen said Its important for us to keep it exciting Weve had so much red carpet it got to the point that I wanted to give a proposition for my friends and customers during the day Enter a black cotton sundress that paired with Christian Louboutin skimmers and a top-handle bag conjured St-Tropez in the 60s It was positively breezy and while the clothes didnt remain quite that low-key when he inevitably turned his eye to evening Posen approached it in a new way Without any of the engineered hourglass seaming hes famous for his long dresses had a more relaxed sensibility For surface interest he tacked floating seams with bugle beads One hundred percent harder than sewing a normal seam he said fingering a tuxedo that featured the couture technique  A guipure lace dress with a stiff yoke that extended a couple of inches above the models shoulders failed to evoke the ease Posen was after and at the other end of the spectrum a hand-crocheted top and skirt looked too crafty But missteps aside Posen did a commendable job here of extrapolating on his strengths and growing his repertoire A special shout-out for a staple seam camisole and matching pants It may not be fancy enough for the Emmys but one of those ladies should snap up the outfit for an after-party$$Zac Posen like so many has Cali on the brain The states beachy joie de vivre and the active lifestyle its residents are known for were the designers jumping-off points this season for his little sister brand ZAC Zac Posen Those notions came through in pieces like sportif dresses with aerodynamic-looking cutouts or a black shorts set which was kitted out with a peplum in honeycomb mesh Mismatched leopard-and-palm suiting had a whiff of the Venice boardwalk about it (albeit through the designers urbane lens) while he pointed to a maxi with a frond print as being particularly Coachella-ready It was in an elevated way and this reference seemed telling in a collection that was both a little sweeter and a little younger than some of Posens recent offerings Case in point separates in candy-colored stripes and a bubble-hem raincoat Elsewhere there was a standout seventies-inspired swingy pink top trimmed in marabou felt ready-made for flouncing onto chaise longues or swanning about poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel Posen wouldnt have been wrong if he had injected a bit of that same drama into some of his other daywear but the evening options here were breezier than ever A pink satin trapeze gown and another in pale aqua with tie-neck detailing were both easy and elegant With results like these wed say some California dreaming suits Posen just fine$$For Spring Zadig & Voltaires creative director Cecilia Bnstrm did not attempt to do new just to do better Its the type of corporate soul-searching approach that a brand is wise to consider after dabbling in various directions unsure which one will stick There was a laundry list of familiar Zadig & Voltaire items on view in the subterranean showroom today fringed suede breezy white cotton dresses alt-cowboy motifs embroidered denim and a crocheted sweater shrug in alpaca Masculine and feminine codes seesawed within single items (biker boots with lace laces) and lingerie pieces crossed over from night to day without constraint  Without a doubt the hero piece this season was the return of the leather dungarees an early brand best seller This latest iteration is being offered as a supple lambskin skirt and the internal team should be prepared to run production on this every season For now though Bnstrm indicated how the girl who ties an army shirt around the waist of her gold-flecked handkerchief dress embodied the brands unwavering homage to rock chicks whether in Paris or halfway around the world The candy-color suitcall it Haribo Tagada pinkmay have been the outlier among a largely neutral offering Then again the logo T-shirts consisted of three inspirational words Happy Peace and Love And for the time being though not indefinitely that would be inspiration enough$$How to make it new again That to make a long story short is the designers conundrum Maria Cornejo was feeling it particularly acutely this season with a whole new team in her studio But rather than stick to old formulasthatd be the easy thing to doshe opted to shake them up Backstage she reported that all of the fabrics were developed in house Its all exclusive but its a lot of work she said Work that paid off  In recent years Cornejo has leaned heavily on prints They havent failed her yet but this season she had only one an oversize brushstroke motif that brightened up a trio of dresses and a pajama set Here more often that not she was experimenting with rich texture from the cubic weave (looks just like it sounds) of a white sundress with wide grosgrain straps to the fringy fil coup of a tunic worn over pants to the pliss leather of an off-the-shoulder top and matching skirt Pleats Huge in 2016  Cornejos research into material culminated in a dress and coat in black-on-white cubist embroidery the graphic gridded precision of which was atypical of the designer who tends to favor curves over hard edges It wasnt just her fabrics that got a rethink either The long almost to-the-ankles silhouette was new for her too Shes particularly keen on the swagger of below-the-knee coats and coat vests Once more Cornejo worked with Bolivian artisans on hand-knits A white sweater that slouched sexily off the shoulders looked like a bona fide hit$$Down Under theres a book published in 1894 called Seven Little Australians Its about a family of seven children and all of the rebelling that ensues They wreaked havoc on [their father]    back then everything was very stitched up says Nicky Zimmermann (an Aussie herself who codesigns with sister Simone) Such bad behaviorespecially in an era of strictnesscaptured her attention for Zimmermanns Spring lineup Very mischievous the designer said I love the idea of an underlying naughtiness with these classic fabrications The 1800s came through in elements like high collars and lace sleeves but the sly insouciance was what captured interest Somehow these frilly things like a dusty pink bib-flounce top with an ivory lattice skirt or a tiered cobalt dress with noir pearling felt plausible for a weekend outing in modern-day Sydney Call it Victoriana for the Bondi Beach set And if at times it felt like a lot in terms of texture and ornateness one look at the crowd confirmed that with this brand more is more and in fact eminently wearablethere were plenty of Zimmermann flounces and filigrees throughout the room To that this brand retains two steadfast strengths One the clothes are always well made But two those clothes are often chameleonic between formal and easyand the theme this season synced nicely with this equation So why not wear bell sleeves to the Bondi Icebergs Be one of those naughty Australians$$Water water everywhere / nor any drop to drink Those lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner sprang instantly to mind upon encountering Zo Jordans new ocean-theme collection She hit her water concept hard evoking the sea in everything from the fishermans knots on the sleeves of cashmere-blend sweaters to wave-printed neoprene to tailored pieces as glittery as ocean phosphorescence All of which could have read as a bit on the nose except that Jordan put together a nicely varied wardrobe herethere was a good range to her easy-to-wear silhouettes The easy-to-wear thing is important The designer has a knack for making un-precious clothes whether a pair of slouchy cropped trousers or an anorak in tonal camouflage jacquard and shes canny about using her materials to give those utilitarian shapes a sense of elevation What she hasnt quite managed to do yet is stamp her label with a strong identitythough the women who will be snapping up Jordans terrific well-priced knits wont likely feel the need to complain about that She seems to be narrowing in on a signature look This season though the Zo Jordanness of Zo Jordan remained slightly out of focus$$From a new Paris showroom Zuhair Murad came across as particularly buoyant He showed off pictures of his delicate lacy designs for the New York City Ballet dancers and revealed that he will be designing JLos wardrobe for her gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas Meanwhile his starting point for Spring was sailor sensuality which despite the campy coupling offered a sea of opportunity to expand on his strengths Daywear largely consisted of nautical elements from marinire dresses in mixed-gauge knits to wide-leg sailor pants Sensitive to his clients lifestyles he steered the theme away from fisherman and toward yacht-level luxestandouts included the crisp white double-breasted captains suit and chic separates resembling naval pennants in satiny scuba material If the plunging-V shorter-than-short jumpsuit in striped sequins went overboard on cheek its exactly the type of piece that could prompt a celeb stylist tug-of-war But the cheek continued with lipstick lips planted in jacquard embroidery and more sequins In each port the women are leaving kisses mused Murad who pointed out that even the monochromatic knits featured lip motifs embedded into the mesh A coral-floral patterning reverted back to his predictable mix of sheer and sparkle Yet the look that outshone all the others was not the least bit glitz instead the satin scuba had been transformed into a solid red gown its elongated top trussed with thick grosgrain Lets call it five-alarm siren$$Fashion and Instagram are such (often saccharine) bedfellows because they are both platforms whose participants are preset for positive affirmation Yet even the most cynical London showgoers are stirred by the sense that Paula Gerbases 1205 is potentially something rather special To truly understand her womens clothes you need to briefly to think about menswear For several years Gerbase was head designer at Kilgour (the Savile Row tailoring house) which is headed up by Carlo Brandelli a compellingly intense chap whose preoccupation is the reduction of the classic masculine suit into its sublimated sculptural essence This is the touchstone upon which the super-serious Gerbase has sparked her own trajectory  Todays collection she said was partially informed by a holiday trek through the Atlas Mountains but thatpahwas just spiel Really what she was doing was whittling down shapes and concepts into a pragmatic-ish conceptual skeleton So we saw carefully slouchy nappa shirts and paneled trousers neutral nonsymmetric knits slung like minimalists' bandoliers and jackets woven of paper with corsetry inserts The color palette was deliciously dull Pliss both in nylon and silk served as the scrunchy subtext against which Gerbases Puritan withdrawal was expressed And all this came underlined by cultishly unsullied all-white Nike Air Max 90s For forensic under-the-radar neutrality in London 1205 is the label to turn to$$Let other New York City fashion designers toast the 10th anniversary of their brand by getting down and dirty Phillip Lim celebrated a decade of 31 with plain old dirt Mounds of the stuff were installed all around Lims catwalk this afternoon in an arrangement designed by architect Maya Lin As Lim revealed after the show the dirt was in fact compost that he and his team had been making from their own food waste and storing up for months I was thinking he said about where things start They start from a seed They start from dirt The compost mounds on the runway which would be de-installed post-show and delivered to local parks thus symbolized both beginnings and rebirth It was a fitting theme for this show which found Lim reprising various signatures but arranging them in a way that felt new This collection boasted a directness that some of Lims recent outings have lackedhis modus operandi here was put simply to take sporty and/or mannish looks and infuse them with a sense of romance That strategy was apparent in the most instantly appealing of the looks he showed today pinstriped pieces billowing with ruffles or collaged with floral prints But it was evidenced as well in the likewise ruffled scuba tops and the bomber jackets done in organza satin or silk This show could have been a touch more concise Lim had several strong ideas going here like the fluid paper-bag waist trousers and the taut sweaters and dresses in burlap nylon that seemed to degrade into floral metallic jacquard and he elevated the collection as a whole by focusing on its sense of hand whether in the luxe green gazar used in a matching bandeau and high-slit skirt or the delicate floral appliqu embellishing otherwise straightforward tops But there was some clutter too The cargo pants and adapted biker jackets could have stayed in the showroom for instance Those pieces werent bad they just diluted the poetry of the show as a whole Lim has made it this farthere will be plenty of time to show biker jackets in the 10 years ahead$$Flower power Yep the power to make a convert of avowed industry tomboy Stella Ishii This season the 6397 founder and her team began with flora in many a form from their signature supersoft pima graphic tees (one in fact read Flower Power another was printed all over with different varietals) to a rose-pattern burnout tank From there on out though it was 6397 business as usual a strong lineup of the killer basics that have made the brand a staunch favorite of industry types One of those staple pieces however went notably missing here the mechanic suit as seen on Bey Heidi Klum et al After seasons in the range Ishii and co are giving the style a break introducing instead a short-sleeved jumpsuit with patch pockets on the chest a higher waistline and a breezy zip front Likewise 6397 has proposed pajama dressing in various forms from the get-go that trends newfound legs should make their silky black set worn together or separately a big hit And hungry denimheads take heart After a couple of seasons of focusing on ready-to-wear the label is back with remnant denim skirts and not one but two new jean shapes the lightweight low-slung Loose Capri and the Tommy a pitch-perfect wide-leg\n"

      "Detachment was the word of the day at A Dtacher (yes like the labels name bien sr) Designer Mona Kowalska loves the high concept and one imagines that today detachment included being unconcerned with the gaze of others Kowalskas woman both as she appears on the runway and the real world dresses for herself Her intensely arty bend and taste for clothes that match it make A Dtacher a cultishly beloved brand among certain shoppers This season Kowalska presented them with a lineup of relatively playful offerings The collection opened with a pair of midi dresses in an Indonesian-inspired floral print which reemerged later imagined with allover Pop white polka dots Elsewhere came cardigans in an uncanny kind of amoxicillin pink that you imagined the A Dtacher woman wearing with tongue firmly in cheek (they had Kawakubo-esque allover holes to boot) The popcorn knits were pretty fun too The choice to use hardier materials lent dresses eccentric volumes but also led to a lineup that often felt frumpy albeit fashionably so At times the clothes lacked the excitement and want-it-now appeal of Kowalskas Spring collection a year ago Still when you looked around the room at todays show and spotted women from all walks of life wearing A Dtacher clothes from various seasons gone by you could be sure theyd find plenty to like here too$$You heard this collection coming long before you saw it a gutsy roar that grew to a crescendo as the models rode around the block from backstage into the courtyard of the Facult de Mdecine Paris Descartes They were riding pillion on a 25-strong lineup of muscle bikesHarleys and Triumphs This was because as An Vandevorst explained pre-show Its a road trip by a woman who lives in the East and has traveled to the West Hence the mirrored Indian beading of lean biker-touched separates and fabulous goth-influenced saris and the silver-shot Chinese brocade on cheongsam-biker hybrids None of these souvenir details was especially literal a studded textured and collarless burgundy jacket looked Chanel-meets-Mongolia (via Antwerp) and made a fine cupola to the elaborately tented blue pliss skirt below Vandevorst ticsfrogging tailoring leanness sculpted volume for effectrecurred most strongly on a set of white looks near the finale that achieved malleable stiffness and an otherworldly glow thanks to the aluminum shot through the fabrics Also starring here was a pedal-to-the-metal judo suit Crocheted face masks with sequined lips were de-sinisterized balaclavas and the footwear naturally was all biker bootsalthough sometimes it featured high heels Road signs were enlarged and broken up into the print used on one long flowing coat worn tied around the waist by its sleevesand once the show was done the bikers outside willfully ignored local traffic regulations and roared off en masse One of them broke down but that was the only glitch in this delightful little riot of a collection$$August saw the announcement of big news for ALC a long time in the works a majority investor in the form of new kid on the block InterLuxe (Jason Wu marks their only other fashion interest to date) And still despite this key development in the labels business designer Andrea Lieberman has gone and turned out one of her most intensely personal collections to date Inspired by a Berber textile she had picked up in her travels and stashed away in a box at her fathers home she let a certain nomadic romanticism guide her hand for Spring to an effect that was soulful and punk at the same time as Lieberman dubbed it A knack for winning and inventive distillations of the 70s and 90s has distinguished ALC for a while now here that came through in spades without so much as a trace of the costumey (the most literal retro indulgences were a great studded jacket in whiskey-color suede and crocheted maxi numbers) Instead Lieberman whipped up fantastic chevron knit gowns and strapless belted maxi dresses  The prints here also stood out as perhaps the labels strongest to date quietly folky-looking pink and chocolate blooms on a black background inspired by a henna-treated ceremonial veil the fantastic simple white tone-on-tone cotton jacquard influenced by a headdress and seen in a matching jacket and A-line skirt and a muted yet lush-looking take on tie-dye  In discussing the lineup Lieberman said she was particularly interested in creating a sense of restraint with these clothes That was here of course and the spare elegance of ALC continues to distinguish it from so many of its peers in the contemporary market but what really spoke most clearly in this collection was a feeling of general offhanded richness It was plenty to whet your palate for the big developments in both retail and wholesale on the horizon for the brand$$They call me the king of basics Jean Touitou said with a laugh at the APC presentation today Kingliness is one thing but the basics bit has lately proved irksome to Touitou He decided to do something about it this season starting by making a capsule offering of little black dresses Its an item whose APC time has come Past due even There are few things more essential to a French womans wardrobe than an LBD after all Touitou used black silk crepe a first for him he admitted but he insisted the silhouettes remain quite simple ensuring they stayed close to the spirit of the brand A long tube dress was cut on the bias so it glided over the body without gripping it and the excess material on a shorter one became a cape-like sash to wear loose behind the back or wrapped around the shoulders A third one cut on the grain and featuring a single leather shoulder strap was a favorite of the editors passing through the companys Rue Madame headquarters  Amidst the boy-cut denim pieces the overalls the smocks and the well-cut trench that rounded out the collection the other news was a shoulder bag made from molded vegetable-dyed leather It had a great saddlebag shape but the novelty wasnt how it looked or what it felt like it was in the fact that it will be available for sale right away not months from now Despite inroads by a few brands fashion seems stubbornly resistant to the see now/buy now concept and the missed opportunities just keep multiplying Good on Touitou and team APC for figuring this project out$$Natalia Alaverdian is a designer with a lot of ideas Good ones Her latest AWAKE collection threaded references to her spirit animal for this season the zebra through a rich variety of motifs ranging from dream-of-Africa aesthetics to ones cribbed from Vermeers Holland and 80s-era fashion from Japan not to mention a dollop of 90s grungy-ness Alaverdian hopped along from one association to another racking them up on top of each other in a way redolent of those corporate brainstorm meetings where every notion no matter how distant from the topic at hand gets added nonjudgmentally to the dry-erase board Alaverdian is at the point in her career as a designer where she should be able to refine her stew of ideas into an easily comprehensible proposition rather than continuing to serve them up brainstorm-style This collection was full of winning piecesfluid duster-length trench coats tops and jackets with sculptural pouf sleeves checked pencil dresses and skirts with muscular ruffles and bowsbut they were swamped by the surfeit of looks that featured complicated asymmetrics or vast volumes that felt nonspecific The motley print and pattern here and the way Alaverdian layered them together added to the sensory overload Its not that Alaverdian needs to trim down her ideassome looks like the A-line floral coat paired with a mid-calf seersucker skirt embellished with rosettes got at all (or at any rate most) of them with clarity and concision When she applies real rigor to her hyper-associative design process the charm of her aesthetic comes through$$Process has always been paramount to Ace & Jigs Jenna Wilson and Cary Vaughanin their own work but also as Spring tells it in that of others The pair were particularly fascinated with the German conceptual artist Wolfgang Laib who worked heavily in natural materials memorably gathering pollens of different consistencies and hue (dandelion hazelnut et al) and creating geometric shapes from them Some of Springs myriad prints nodded to those forms but there are plenty of inherent parallels to the duos process The looms in India that their cotton gauzes are woven on are traditional and time-honored a far cry from fashions heavily automated present Textiles are always the real news for Ace & Jig and Springs most winning developments included a graphic black-and-red stripe pitch-perfect as a column gown as well as nods to kente fabrics Warmth has long been a distinguishing characteristic of Wilson and Vaughans clothingthat came through here in spades Best of all was a stunning kimono with a hand-woven collar created in collaboration with Los Angeles textile studio All Roads$$A bohemian circle of muses have been in heavy rotation for the last couple of seasonsJoni Mitchell Janis Joplin and the likebut now it seems that things in fashion might be moving to a new musical beat Acne Studios creative director Jonny Johansson is certainly keen on pressing the fast-forward button and his latest collection vibrated with an energy that fell somewhere between 80s electro and 90s rave culture Electric guitars made of chrome and plexiglass which embellished the length of cropped trousers and boxy suiting were the most obvious leitmotifs here More convincing though were the eye-catching optical polka-dot prints that resembled the dilated pupils of euphoric ravers on floor-length velvet and silk dresses that were fastened in the back with guitar-like strapsa cool take on the slip dressing trend If one were to peg the collection to a stylish musical icon in particular it would likely be Grace Jones The radical 67-year-old Jamaican singer just published her memoirs and has been inspiring a new generation of fans with her risk-taking sorry-not-sorry sense of style Jones recently caused a stir at the Afropunk Festival in New York wearing one of her many elaborate costumes (it involved little more than a corset G-string body suit and a Hula-Hoop that she kept spinning around her lithe torso) The blazers-cum-minidresses that Johansson paired with short-as-you-dare hot pants and statement asymmetric shades were a look that Jones could pull off to this day though its doubtful who else could besides superstar bad gals like Rihanna perhaps who has been making headlines with her pantless ensembles all summer long In some ways it felt as if part of the grounding street smart vibrations that first propelled Acne into the spotlight were lacking today the cut and fit of their original oversized biker jackets and shearling coat is still hard to beat after all Still warm-weather dressing isn't something that Nordic fashion folk have much time to experiment with The discharge-print boy racer tees and charming checkerboard slip-on Moroccan slippers on the other hand are likely to be a hit with the first bloom of spring$$Walking into Adam Lippess Washington Square apartment presentation is a rare Fashion Week treat From the breakfast spread to his trio of standard poodles to this seasons piano player you feel instantly at home At the very least you want to move in  Against this exceedingly pleasing backdrop Lippes presented a fine new collection one that solidified his reputation for effortless chic but also found him developing new categories Lippes said an audacious floral-print suit from his Fall collection had something to do with his Spring experiments He figured its bold color and pattern would render it an outlier On the contrary its been a total sellout and its success gave him the license he needed to try a glam white jumpsuit with an outer layer in hand-macramd silk cord Its a feat of engineering and easily the sexiest thing hes done yet A strapless black silk faille gown was more demure but an equally convincing foray into high evening Still its his polished sportswear thats been helping him double his business each season so the big emphasis here was on daywear Pieces like a 16-ply cashmere sweatshirt accompanied by gold micro pliss pants as comfy as pjs a washed denim apron dress thrown over an oversize poplin tee and slouchy linen track pants teamed with a striped shirt its elongated tails hanging loose in back Lippess mo is refined but not so much so that it compromises his clothes casual factor Extra credit for the generously proportioned slip dresses in an Agnes Martininspired abstract print$$Ever the adventurer Adam Selman will gleefully chart a course where others dare not go Fall found him obsessed with Cookie Mueller an oft-overlooked bad girl in John Waterss morally bankrupt coterie This season Selman blew all the way to one of the smaller Hawaiian islands where he discovered Taylor Camp a 60s and 70s nudist colony on the oceanfront property of a witting Howard Taylor shortly after his impossibly glamorous sister Elizabeth played her baddest role yet in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf Selman is keenly aware that he has a fondness for foul-mouthed spitfires Ill always have my bad girls he chuckled backstage beaming through his signature stache Clothing isnt optional on a runway so Selman snapped out of his beach-induced high brushed off the sand and set about crafting latter-day hippiewear with a focus on what he called nonchalant exposure Joyful flower prints and appliqus on jaunty summer dresses bounded out to a cheery sing-along soundtrack They were mixed with breezy denim separates as well as white bandeaux and drawstring slacks some of which were reversed to reveal seams and pockets An erstwhile symbol of modesty gauzy crinolines were stripped of their cumbersome shells and placed front and center starting with the first exit Converse All Stars were also reworked DIY-style to become platform espadrilles However a baby tee with an illustrated image of a woman smoking a blunt was obscured by a denim jacket by the time it hit the catwalk This wasnt just a nod to pot-smoking free-loving skin-baring hippies but also an ode to an authentic craftsy look in particular the work of Todd Oldham the designer perhaps best loved for so artfully cobbling things together on MTVs House of Style with Cindy Crawford Unbeknownst to most there he was in the audience today happily yakking it up with more of Selmans bad girls Amy Sedaris and Lea DeLaria (Orange Is the New Black) Its a tribute to me asked Oldham after the show in believable disbelief He described how he and Selman had met while hanging wallpaper with Sedaris Im in awe of Adam he said Hes the real deal$$Hanako Maeda has been busy rediscovering her Japanese roots On a recent trip to Kyoto she grew particularly enamored of her native countrys architecture For Spring she focused on marrying the aesthetic heritage of Japan with the lean sophistication of New York her adopted hometown just as East met West during the Edo period Maedas clothes have never lacked in urbane appeal so it was a particular treat to see how she incorporated traditional elements and pitted structure against fluidity The past several seasons have witnessed the designer loosening up her once ladylike vernacular and there was a downright languidness to these pieces The kimono was of particular interest to Maeda who borrowed traditional prints from those garments and elements of the obi that cropped up on a flowing wrap dress or across the front of a long vest Elsewhere the knotted neckline on a gauzy maxi nodded to the process behind traditional shibori dyeing techniques and the red harness-like sash on a starry black-and-white gown (perhaps the strongest look in todays lineup) echoed the tasuki traditionally worn by Japanese drum players among others But you could hardly hope for a more fitting marriage of the modern-day and the traditional than Maedas raw indigo denim mini with a flowing underlay of shibori-printed chiffon Despite the newfound ease to her clothes Maeda remains as adroit as ever when it comes to evening Her strapless obi-inspired jacquard dress (look 29) was just the antidote to overwrought red carpet fare Between day and night these pieces added up to the labels strongest outing in recent memory If Maeda has had a tendency in the past to change her course a bit from season to season you hoped shed stay this one$$According to the folks at Adidas HQ this seasons Adidas by Stella McCartney collection was inspired by athletes Well    duh Isnt this an activewear line What McCartneys reflection on athletes and athleticism meant in practice was that this was a collection more focused on functionality than aestheticsthe updates mainly had to do with details of cut and fabrication that optimized the performance of the apparel That was witnessed in the feathery weight of the running gear and elements such as compression bands reflective strips mesh inserts and internal cooling dots placed at points on the body where the body generates the most heat McCartneys zebra-print maillots were cut with an eye toward hydrodynamismthey also looked a good deal hipper than the standard-issue racing suitand her seamless knit onesie managed to hark back to Western yoga practices boho roots and deploy new textile technology in aid of peak flexibility Women who are devotees of a particular sport will appreciate McCartneys care in seeing to their utilitarian needs those who mainly aim to compete in the sport of fashion meanwhile will glom on to pieces such as the designers floral-print anorak and ergonomic black-and-white sandal an excellent alternative come spring to the omnipresent Birk Performance was the focus here in other words but there was more than one way this collection performed$$This collection was an ode to Tiresias a bird-communicating Greek soothsayer who blabbed divine secrets and was punished by being blinded then turned into a womanas whom she was both praised as a priestess and pilloried as a prostitute (depending on who you read)before eventually gender-reverting Which is actually kind of now The clothes themselves seemed more literal articulations of the 18th century (perhaps edging the cusp of the 19th) in terms of form There were full-bodied frock coats with jauntily pointed tales corsetry an inclination toward ruffle-free yet jabot-like fullness at the neck and a sense of tailoring pared back and made primitive As an Aganovich virgin to these eyes there also seemed a soft backdrop of Ackermann Watanabe and Westwood here neither as debt nor derivation just context  The collection was an ongoing argument between the tie (masculine trope) and the color pink (feminine trope) Both tropes were warped abused remixed and blended Batik-dyed linen was the outer layer against folded-back flashes of silk organza animal print an inversion of hierarchy that saw the rougher fabric promoted to front of house with the snazzier pushed to the fringes There were moments when the fumes pumping forth from the Viper smoke machine became a little too thick to see all the orchid undulations on offer or to appreciate the twists in the muted monochrome brocades Yet there was clarity enough to appreciate this tightly packed meditation on wearable tumult$$This was a poignant presentationyet not necessarily in the way that Agnonas producers intended In the atrium a tree had been installed whose foliage was a mixture of desiccated leaves and dead butterflies From its lifeless branches hung 16 looks that were two-thirds miniaturized in cashmere voile11 from the archive and five from the new collection What they demonstrated was how rich the history of this mill specializing in rare yarns and founded by Francesco Ilorini Mo in 1953 truly is Balmain Dior Chanel Cardin Saint Laurent (when it was all about Yves)back in the day Agnona cast all of these canonical designers sketches in wool Agnona made brilliance real  Today Well its not awful Agnona is never going to be a summer house obviously Still there was a gorgeous suede wrap dress that while completely divorced from the essence of this brand was a thing of beauty and rightfully spotlighted center stage Some impressive hand-painted pliss pants were worth an ogle The brown leopard blouse was less moving the foliage-print caftans were definitely wearable but the safari jackets just served as piquant reminders of Saint Laurent Agnona is owned by Ermenegildo Zegnaa titanic fashion house whose main business is the sartorial outfitting of men The arrival of Stefano Pilati was heralded as a new dawn for the Agnona-Zegna womenswear dream team That plan changed when Pilatis focus shifted to the wonderful Zegna Couture In the meantime Agnona has been left out in the colda book without an author It deserves one$$Akriss Albert Kriemler has long looked to architecture as a reference but he made the relationship explicit for Spring teaming up with the Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto to create fabrics Fujimoto designed Londons Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in 2013 Kriemler was so moved by the matrix of white steel poles that he approached Fujimoto about working together Backstage it was hard to tell who was more excited about the collaborationKriemler or Fujimoto The architect sat in the front row it was his first fashion show Architecture is architecture and clothes are clothes Bringing them together isnt always the smoothest project Indeed there were a few proposals here that read as too literal A dress made from thin strips of cork to look like wood siding with a black mesh window at the hip for example was a little on the nose The Forest of Music is a music hall project in Budapest with a molded round roof that has openings for trees to grow The shirts and skirts it inspired were perhaps a tad eccentric for the Akris customer Where the clients are concerned the best pieces on the runway were the ones made from square slices of Perspex sealed between two layers of organza The streamlined dresses glinted subtly they wont require any backstory on the sales floor On the other hand if the Akris woman learns about Naoshima the Japanese island filled end-to-end with art museums and site-specific installations including Fujimotos faceted pavilion then this Akris collection was a job well done$$The backdrop of Alberta Ferrettis show was an aerial video of the desert sand sliding over mile upon mile of dunes nothing but sun wind and skyand just about as far away from Milans rain-soaked streets as you could get today The wide-open vistas offered clues to Ferrettis frame of mind The desert is free theres movement there are possibilities she said backstage I closed my eyes and we had many many ideas  Nature is a theme that Fausto Puglisi would take up a few hours later but where his version was rough around the edges Ferrettis this season was bohemian There was a bit of the festival girlCoachella by way of Burning Manto her pieced lace slip dresses and patchwork suede shifts in warm shades of brown and black Ferretti has made a specialty of whisper-thin dresses over the years Usually they have more of a red carpet orientation but true to her word here they came in breezy chiffons with fraying at the edges and as a decorative motif Along with the lacy white cotton numbers slightly Victorian in spirit these were among the best pieces in the show effortless and earthy perched on corded gladiator sandals where some of the more elaborately worked and printed dresses often with rough-hewn gold jewelry came off heavy and overdone  A detour through some safari-influenced daywear captured that easy vibe but they seemed rather beside the point At Alberta Ferretti the dress is always the thing$$For Spring Alessandra Rich unveiled an unabashedly feminine collection dubbed Dolores after an invented South American heroine one whose wardrobe for her romantic escapades is punctuated by expanses of lace frilled fluted hems and large poufy sleeves worn off the shoulder The story is of a girl who runs away to get married said Rich at an appointment off the Rue Saint-Honor characteristically charming and wearing one of the gold heartaccented belts that accessorized the runway looks Its probably a bad idea but she does it anyway And she does it in style An excellent waist-whittling trenchcoat in silk moir was offered in three colorways (black white and fuchsia) and proved just the ticket for a dramatic escape from disapproving parents and friends The wedding festivities would be celebrated in bow-topped tiers of fluffy white lace She is definitely a girl in love purred Rich and it shows party dresses came in pleated cutout off-the-shoulder lam or as a series of paillette-bedecked wiggle gowns with trumpet hems while a number of silk rompers were deployed for their lingerie codas (one plunging cream tie-accented dress was very Bianca Jagger) But among all of the exuberance it was the selection of seriously good denim (the use of the textile being a first for Rich) jackets body-conscious dresses and sleek jumpsuits that just might prove to outlast the honeymoon period After all as every girl knows flash can be fun but strong and steady often ends up winning the day$$And then there was light    Alexander Lewis isnt afraid of a religious reference but he wasnt riffing on Genesis in his new light-themed collection Rather on this occasion he took Richard Dawkinss tack and regarded the science of light with a near-spiritual sense of awe This season Lewis collaborated with the artist Flavie Audi who makes sculptures of metal and glass and he was fascinated by the way light plays on and within her work That inspired a study of the properties of lightits wavelike form the way it refracts through prisms how its reflection glimmers and splits across the surface of things It was a good season in other words for Lewis to have sponsorship from crystal honchos Swarovski Lewis got at his theme via a variety of means He made rubbings of Audis sculptures and developed cloud-like prints and patterned jacquards and he peered into the insides of her work and watched the alchemy of her materials then created galactic-looking prints that magnified those reactions There were also crystal-dappled sheer silks frequently found layered with other more plainspoken materials such as shirting pinstripe that recalled the reaction prints starry night sky effect Elsewhere Lewis conjured light waves via crystal strands dangling off a dress or caviar crystal pressed into the fabric of a pale blue skirt Blue was the key color here this collection also emphasized dresses and skirts more than most Lewis outings The collection was at its best oddly when Lewis interpreted his theme either extremely literally or extremely looselyhis pinstripe pieces were a highlight for instance but so was the sweater with a refracting prism intarsia-ed across the front and a cropped top with mirror cube embroidery The one quibble here really was with Lewiss insistence that all his garments express his concept either more or less directly In general his sense of focus redounds to his benefit but it would be nice to see this designer loosen up a little and permit himself to say cut a sharp pair of trousers or conjure a fluid flattering dress just because they complement the rest of his collection Lewis gets his points across just finehe should have the confidence going forward not to underline them$$The girls had pink-cheeked complexions and tousled hair flowing down their backsa bunch of young English roses who might have been caught by Julia Margaret Camerons camera lens in Victorian times What they were dressed in were the prettiest and most personal designs that have come from Sarah Burton since she took over as creative director of Alexander McQueen Gone were the face-obscuring headdresses and ironclad corsets gone the hobbling platform shoes I wanted it to be believable touchable soft said Burton backstage To an extent the beautiful dresseswith their ruffles cascading across the body and falling off shoulders the palette of pale pink the flower-strewn patterns the pristine cotton the tattered lace and the frock-coated tailoringspeak for themselves Everything about them in these times when every camera phone has a zoom lens can be examined in all their extraordinary detail down to the finest knitted stitches the flower-painted wooden clogs and the couture-level embroidery On the other hand for all that the ethereal lightness whip-smart tailoring and elaborate designs communicated a new relaxed of-the-season relevance they also carried the story of a London history that Burton wanted to make known  She explained that shed been inspired by the 17th-century silk weavers of Spitalfields members of the Huguenot Protestant faith who fled religious persecution in France and settled in Londons East End I loved the stories of how they arrived with very little bringing seeds and bulbs in their pockets to grow They were gardeners And they wove their French flowers into the patterns on their silks  Burtons choice of reference point was personalshe is a country girl with a real love of naturebut the resonances run deeper than her attraction to pretty flowers Alexander McQueen traced part of his family bloodline back to some of the estimated 50000 Huguenot refugees who were welcomed into Britain by the edict of King Charles II and became producers of high fashion silks for court finery and the great homes of England McQueen was proud of that link to the first immigrants to bring luxury fashion to London and he would surely approve of his former protge using this platform to point to the parallels with todays migrant crisis  There was one silk dress covered with sprigs of flowers that came somewhere in the middle of the collection and was a near replica of a 17th-century court dress Burton examined How funny to imagine that this delightful demure dress might have its own outing at the British court in the 21st century Kate Middleton would look wonderful in it$$Alexander Wang has always loved a bash and for his 10th anniversary collection tonight he threw himself a big one Up front a merch table sold his DoSomethingorg tees and sweats which benefit the organizations youth and social change efforts It was straight out of a rock show a feeling that was accentuated inside the venue by the crush of celebrities who sat in the front row Kanye West Nicki Minaj Lady Gaga Josh Ostrovsky (aka The Fat Jew) The Weeknd Bella Hadid Mary J Blige    the list goes on Post-show a curtain at the back of the runway opened to reveal a phalanx of pole dancers who entertained the throngs until it was time for the partys big numbers Tinashe Lil Wayne and Ludacris all performed But the nights main act was the video that played after the models took their finale spin An extended highlights reel it was a long loud chronological look back at Wangs first decade from his early bows short-haired and baby-faced at 21 all the way through last Novembers H&M collab and his Fall 15 advertising campaign  Its a critical moment for Wang In July he and Balenciaga opted not to renew their contract beyond its first three-year term Such a short tenure at such a prestigious house could tarnish a designers reputation but Wang has emerged essentially unscathed and as he seemed to be saying with tonights hoopla bigger than ever  When the split was announced Wang suggested that he wanted to turn his focus to his eponymous brand That meant expectations were elevated for this new collection If some of the surrounding festivities (ahem those pole dancers) were somewhat off-message he nailed the collection which was free of pretense No concept he said backstage summing up the straight-off-the-streets ethos of the clothes Were always asking ourselves whats modern Well whats modern is whats right in front of us Thats an idea thats gained traction in the industry over the last couple of years but it was Wangs own approach at the beginning It worked for him then and save for a couple of costumey fringed leather pieces it worked for him tonight with his deconstructed denim army surplus separates pajama silks slip dresses and one shrunken satin bomber jacket Wang intuitively gets what the downtown cool girl wants to wear Theres no disputing the New Yorkiness of his clothes but no anniversary collection is complete without a throwback moment Anybody still wondering what the AW510 insignia that turned up on an oversize hoodie and some of the mens pieces stands for Wang remember hails from Northern California 510 is the born-in-the-Bay-Area area code of his cellphone$$Few and far between are the menswear designers willing and able to transition into the womens market In fact its a genuinely rare scenario that often builds in reverse so when ex-Cloak designer Alexandre Plokhov tried his hand at a ladies line for Fall 2015 trusting devotees welcomed his evolution with open arms Now that moody almost all-black debut is hitting stores the Eve to Plokhovs Adam has hit her stride for Springforegoing the darkly draped tendency of his first outing in favor of a crisp sensuality where D-ring cinched belts snap-buttoned patch pockets and zipped lapels helped shape his utilitarian vision Having tweaked a cropped tailoring silhouette and developed a wrapped linear form to his apron dresses and boxy tunics Plokhov accented this collection with a slew of subtly worked-on fabricsturning to washed leather patchwork jersey polka dots and a shredded stripe jacquard that felt rich in hand against his flat cotton poplins The latter material was frayed and box-pleated across shirtsleeves and buttoned A-line skirts both of which appeared in a sunny shade of citrus yellow in his Paris showroom Though edited out of these images that optimistic shade joined the black navy and sand color lineup to further shake up the masculine tendencies of Plokhovs oeuvre rendering his outsider label all the more relevant in a season rife with gender ambiguity$$If you laid out the looks from Alexandre Vauthiers Fall haute couture collection alongside those he proposed for Spring ready-to-wear youd very quickly have a stack of matching pairsright down to the shoes produced by Sebastian Of course nothing would be identical for ready-to-wear Maison Lesage hand-embroidery became mechanical and the leather fringes now appeared in jersey But the gist was there Even Daria Strokus who closed Vauthiers couture show returned as his ready-to-wear leading lady (looking particularly femme fatale in the Oscar Niemeyerdesigned French Communist Party Headquarters) The temptation to declare dj vu lessens once you take the holistic view that a designer needs a top-notch testing ground to breed the best ideas (and for what its worth Raf does the same over at Dior) Plus Vauthier upholds his fixation with fitthe body-grazing blazers and body-con laced bias dresses revealed curves not compromises He took pride in showing how he turned an obscenely expensive lace-encrusted dress into a generally expensive lace-encrusted dress without a noticeable difference And the opium red leather biker dress was basically a dead ringer In fact the biggest difference with Vauthiers ready-to-wear offering was the injection of filler pieces sexy bodysuits tailored vests and an LBD that can be worn loose and poncho-style or sleekly belted Within the past two weeks Aubrey Plaza Suki Waterhouse and Vauthiers loyal patroness Carine have all furthered his red carpet visibility But while this may be prime advertising the introduction of a dressed-down linen grouping suggested its not his sole focus Each of the piecesbe it a jumpsuit or a shirtdressreceived some sort of Vauthier golden touch Maybe theyll prove the launchpad for his Spring couture$$In 2011 a food-supply scandal made the news in China when watermelon farmers who had sprayed their crops with a chemical product that promised rapid growth were dismayed to discover it served only to make their melons explode into worthless pulp Earlier this month a minority stake in Alexis Mabille was sold to a 3400-outlet Chinese fast-fashion outfit called Peacebird which plans to roll out a network of Mabille stores in China Mabille chose the watermelon as his motif for this his first post-Peacebird ready-to-wear collection There was a sequined watermelon on the front of a ruche-armed sweatshirt teamed with some jaunty shorts and a sheer half-skirt watermelon print split-to-the-hip pants watermelon bracelets watermelon necklacesyou get the drift More ambiently watermelon-touched were the dubious contra-color layered lace slip dressesin watermelon-esque tonesand satin separates This collection was at its best when sans watermelon yet explosive of silhouette The oversize biker jackets and skirts were easy and fun There was also a sweet 80s-flavor jumpsuit with volumized arms and a tonal fold at the neck Plus Mabille slices a pretty fine jacket The single vented (watermelon) red example with an interestingly projecting revere was proof of that There was an emphasis on open-at-the-back shirtingperfectly fineand an insistence on miniature backpack fanny packskind of Philipp Plein This was very much a locals show packed to its marble rafters with Parisians breathily just-about tolerating (as only Parisians can) the abundance of their fellows The new Peacebird aspect to Mabilles story lent it an edge which the clothes unfortunately rather lacked It also made you really hanker after a nice ripe slice of lovely juicy watermelon organic ideally$$I feel like baby number three sort of inspired the desert vibes said Alice + Olivia designer Stacey Bendet who is scheduled to give birth next Tuesday and still had the wherewithal to slip into a minidress and thigh-high platform boots for her presentation today This pregnancy got me really thinking about the inner goddess of the woman which led me somehow to the desert she said Of course the aforementioned bump made traveling a good deal trickier Bendet thus relied on the desert of her imagination conjuring up images of Earth Mothers and boho babes frolicking among the dunes in hand-embroidered skirts flouncy off-the-shoulder tops and gowns and sun-baked neutrals It helped too that she had a man on the ground [Contemporary artist] Francesco Clemente is a good friend of mine and he kept texting me photos of desert butterflies and flowers so that also helped to inspire the collection said Bendet Overall this was a softer more romantic outing for Alice + Olivia Bendet worked with chiffons and ruffles in pale shades of nude blush and icy blue to create what she dubbed her goddess gowns She also wanted to create dresses that could be worn during the day with flats but would still be sufficiently special for evening Bendet accomplished her goal in the patchwork lace dresses in black and faded ivory that swished delicately at the ankle Meanwhile a high-neck gown hand-embroidered with flowers was exactly the kind of thing one dreams of wearing to a Mexican wedding one day While Alice + Olivia is still strongest in the eveningwear category Bendet had plenty on offer for day too The designer introduced a line of couture denim into the collection this seasonflared jeans that had been hand-embroidered with flowers or laser-cut in a leaf pattern I really wanted to focus on the return of the pant as a statement item said Bendet who also churned out embellished wide-leg gown pants Every season the designer includes a capsule black-and-white collectionmixed in with the boho embroidery and soft hues those pieces felt a little out of place this go-round However Bendet knows her customers well and each season a portion of them unfailingly want black and white Sometimes creative vision has to bow to good old-fashioned business sense$$There are responsibilities laid before fashion designers like 32-year-old Joseph Altuzarra the chief of which is the pressure to capture the times in the form of clothes This season one of the instincts which is being thrust to the fore is escapism or at least a resistance to the troubling forces at work in the world Altuzarras answer to that was a Spring collection he described in his studio as Very serene about the beauty of materials which are close to nature like linen cotton and burlap things which are not fussy and meant to look wrinkled The search for authentic emotion led him to research the Spanish side of his identitythe heritage of his fathers upbringing in the rugged Basque region of northern Spain home to self-reliant mountain-dwelling and sea-faring people On the other hand Altuzarras own reality is very much attuned to a certain modern urban womans demands or at least his interpretation of them Its all very well yearning for the wild and free but what does that look like when walking on the streets of New York Altuzarras creative compromise could be read in the details high-heeled espadrilles (partly made by a Spanish craftsman) braided jute shoulder straps on skimpy linen camisole dresses and rope frogging on navy nautical blazers and jumpsuits He had worked hard on injecting a sense of the handmade into his textiles with lots of pleating derivedat some distancefrom folkloric costume hand-painted prints in greens blues and sunrise orange and some beautiful micro beaded embroideries on broderie anglaise at the end It made for a collection which was at its most appealing in the hand and on a rail where the minutiae and the weightlessness of the fabricsand their rare luxurious qualitiescould be felt One could also see Altuzarras pragmatic understanding of clothes that can perform in the midst of urban heat (as well as the close-up chic of such things as the tan leather saddle-stitched clip-on earrings) On the runway though the presentation somehow lacked the sense of joie de vivre women look for in summer even in baking cities and on their way to work Maybe that had to do with Altuzarras choice of uniformly ultra-slim models whose unsmiling neutrality failed to bring his stated aim of carefree believably to life Whether its summer winter or anything in between Altuzarra's work with its man-attracting slit skirts and dresses would look a whole lot sexier on a knowing womans curves Customers would see that in a changing room doubtless but it would be a healthy humanizing step forward if Altuzarra could bring himself to show it on the runway too$$Designers often use music as an inspiration This season Andre Walkers collection riffed on a single song Althea & Donnas 1977 reggae classic Uptown Top Ranking At an appointment this afternoon Walker said hed always wanted to do a thesis on that tracka really truly terrific one if youve never heard itand explained that hed dug into its lyrics to further his brainstorming Dem check sey we hipWalkers check came in linen and looked plenty hip in garments such as his short-sleeved tailored jacket with its folded-under blurred hem See me in a halter back    give you a heart attackWalkers funnel-neck halter-tops were sui generis in particular coming in a cotton print of head sculptures by his friend and frequent collaborator Sylvie Auvray He did his own versions of the songs khaki suit too albeit in dove gray Walkers (admittedly casual) research extended beyond the lyrics of Uptown Top Ranking He also asked his parents what had been going on in Kingston Jamaica around the time the track was recorded They told him that denizens of the uptown area of the city had marked off their territory as a posh one and taken to natty dressing to suit the attitude One of the charms of Walkers collection was that it got at that nattinessnote his pencil skirts cape-shouldered jacket tops and precise tailored dresses with their cutout sideswhile simultaneously summoning the chillaxed vibe of the song that had inspired him Mesh-like pointelle knits and a generous helping of fishnet provided the collection with some breeziness both literally and figuratively while skirts cut to suggest the look of shorts or slouchy trousers introduced another kind of casual mien Much of Walkers focus here was on fuzzing the hard edges of his silhouettes as witnessed in that blurred hem jacket for instance but also in standout garments like his layered gray eyelet and white fishnet pencil skirt and a cropped jacket with soft vertical pleats in the front Perhaps that instinct to soften was another tribute to Althea & Donnaafter all the most famous lyrics in their one big hit go Love is all I bring And this collection certainly felt open-hearted$$As the lights dimmed to signal the start of Andrew Gns show an omniscient accented voice gravely announced that the designer had just undergone unexpected surgery for a heart condition Despite a promising recovery he could not be present Andrew has worked on this collection until the last moment with all his passion and determination the voice continued He hopes you will like it Leaving barely a minute to process Gns life-threatening episode the pulsing music began and the show went on beginning with dynamic daywear inspired by getaways to the north of France and ending with sumptuously embellished gowns based on a Chinese imperial porcelain bowl Gn inherited from his parents  Delineating the collection into two seemingly disparate parts confirmed that Gn is creatively ambidextrous and clearly enjoys the freedom to propose sharp and soft in a single offering The latter resituated the butterflies and peonies from his family heirloom against vibrant backgrounds like a Pop Art homage to chinoiserie While the butterflies were as detailed as any of the specimens on display at Deyrolle the embroideries and multicolored stones turned pretty dresses into collector pieces Waxing rhapsodic about surface treatments feels strange given the circumstances Fashion may course through Gns veinshed sooner be inspired by the idea of a vacation than take onebut health comes before all else So Andrew we wish you a smooth and speedy recovery And rest assured we liked it$$Give Angelos Bratis the plainest piece of fabric and in no time itll be transformed into a draped wonder He is an intuitive dressmaker Hes adamant about not being called a designer No sketches or mood boards for himjust thoughtful consideration of body shape Working on this collection was a sort of therapy for me said Bratis during a walk-through held in a light-filled hypermodern space where models where standing in front of a maze of mirrors that reflected the surrounding forest of skyscrapers part of a newly built Milanese architectural landscape  Bratis retreated to his native Greek village in the mountains near Athens to put together a lineup of beautiful dresses with the help of his mother She is a great seamstressshe taught me everything he said pointing out liquid bias-cut polka-dot numbers cut from a single piece of silk with decorative smock motifs hand-sewn with contrasting thread I was thinking about the myth of Ariadne my Greek heritage comes up in the most unexpected ways through memories images dreams I love geometry arithmetic the mathematics of dance the logic game of music and rhythm But there is nothing conceptual about Bratiss creative process Hes a sensualist and his dresses reveal love and respect for the female body Their shapes had a free flow they were cut in fluid languid fabrics and built with sophisticated draping effects their asymmetric hems skimming the body and giving way to a soft undulating movement Not surprisingly Aegean blue was the color of choice an homage to Bratiss homeland that was also expressed in the melancholic melodies played by the harpist Vanja Contu clad in one of Bratiss elegant kaftans$$On heels so soaring that the average height of these looks was within a whisper of six and a half feet this Ann Demeulemeester collection trod pointedly around themes of personal expression recreational repression and commercial concession The topstitched paneled black tailoring of which the facades veered from biker to tuxedo the painstakingly ruched black leather pants and the backless black tank topsslash-waistcoats with a melee of obi-belt knotting at the navel were all no-brainer ticks on a buyers list The Demeulemeester codes factor in waft and sheerness so more ticksalthough perhaps applied a touch less firmlyat the lightly fitted transparent racer-back silk dresses sometimes metallically agleam and long jackets in softly acid blurrily animal greens and yellows Artistic director Sebastien Meunier said the collection was titled Rising and that his starting point was the angular unreality of Alberto Giacometti then added It is about the extreme elegance of women how tall how bright how mysterious they can be I pushed them in a super-elegant kinky sadomasochist form This explained the choker-topped harnesses that were sometimes effectivewho knew a white harness under black suiting complemented by white sunglasses could be an uncreepily powerful accessory arsenal Yet S&M motifs speak of subjugationalbeit consensualas well as power and so seem only queasily reconcilable with the runway The oily chartreuse feathering on sleeves and coral-like clusters of quills were here thanks to Meuniers collaboration on this collection with artist Kate MccGwire The quilled pieces were simultaneously beautiful and sad organic reductions into abstraction for the sake of it This lineup lacked the uplift that Meuniers last menswear outing seemed to augur Yet for those who enjoy pain this was not a pleasure to watchbecause it was fine$$The penultimate day of the New York show sprint and who among us isnt in need of a visit to some far-flung beachy locale Thats just what Anna Sui served up tonight albeit only a stones throw from the fracas of an assembled many awaiting another iconoclast (the lady Madge) over at Madison Square Garden Prompted by a recent getaway of her own to Tahiti and Honolulu Sui riffed on pops long-standing affair with island life from the 30s starlet Dorothy Lamour to Elviss trinity of Hawaiian movies to David Baileys shot of a bronzed sun-soaked Marie Helvin Even Jane Campions high-minded New Zealand period piece The Piano made the cut in the form of a little subtly placed Victoriana Suis tendency toward an almost magpie-like archivists eye remains one of her more defining and compelling characteristics In addition to the above references she looked at sailors valentines (the intricate seashell artworks) and even lifted a phrase from the 1941 Gary Cooper vehicle Ball of Fire killer diller the choice slang of Barbara Stanwycks lippy nightclub performer Sugarpuss OShea came embroidered across the back of a top Indeed todays Honolulu honeys embodied all the best parts of kitsch its color its humor its play Bowling shirts and souvenir jackets came to new life in Suis hands the latter enjoyed a major revival last season but even if they were downright du monde youd be hard-pressed to argue with Suis take lushly beaded with lurid-looking sunsets and pinup mermaids Elsewhere was a dreamy marabou-trimmed peignoir that seemed to have dropped straight out of a Bunny Yeager snap and onto the palm treedotted catwalk It all made for a deliciously heightened version of the tourist tat of another era And what of the prints Sui enlisted the fabled Zandra Rhodes to create a custom pattern a delightful seashell number (Gigi Hadid very memorably donned a scarlet sarong in it) One Lurex-drenched undersea chiffonwith angel fishes and allwas a real winner Sui also sent out an octopus intarsia and board shorts crafted from a heady-looking butterfly lace  Even as fashion continues to ride high on a wave of heavy minimalism (though a sea change is surely in the works) Sui is a designer who serves as a vivid testimony to the power of well-deployed profusion Todays was the kind of blissful high-energy romp to assist even the most fatigued among ussocks and sandals optional$$Upon arrival at the Anrealage show at the Palais de Tokyo this afternoon guests were greeted by waiters carrying trays of glasses In one there was water in the other sake Both clear liquids entirely alike in all properties except the important ones Really you seeits all in how you look at things Until of course it isnt Wireless headsets and elaborate instructions had been left on the seats The Springcollection one quickly gathered via the pamphlet and theEnglish robotic voice provided by the accompanying recording (think Benedict Cumberbatch meets Siri) was inspired by reflection specifically how it warps reality The clothes would only be fully visible through an iPhones camera app after being photographed with a flasha very modern take on a mirror its true but considering the plethora of devices held aloft during Fashion Week not exactly a stretch When the clothes appeared and were drowned in a flurry of handheld flashes what first appeared to be a plain light gray or black-and-white striped dress became a neon houndstooth check a glen plaid transformed into a tartan a fancy tweed a patchwork pinstripes were lace white became a kaleidoscope pattern Mt Fuji a quilt A speckled-looking frilledblack frock suddenly boasted the galaxy at warp speed courtesy of what the show notes described as an official collaboration with the filmStar Wars (which if true should provide at least one of the upcomingfilms young stars with a seriously viable red carpet ensemble for an upcoming Comic-Con) Often the garments themselves were reversed inverted rejiggered two pieces sewn together at the hemisphere to make a slightly off-kilter asymmetrical form which came out a lot more appealingly than it sounds especially in the case of the cropped bomber jackets rounded sleeve sheaths and short A-line shifts One has come to expect this level of technological trickery from designerKunihiko Morinaga who has played with the ideas of exposure light and shadow before But here his fabric innovationsdeveloped in collaboration with a company that specializes in recursive reflective paint the type used in markers and signs at construction sitescame with a smattering of actually wearable shapes a combination that promises to move beyond the purely conceptual and into actual closets (Plus it must be said What a good party trick)$$For a Spring season theres been remarkably little heat on the runway Its been one more or less sexless show after another then along comes Anthony Vaccarello  The Belgian-Italian designer as his fans and his detractors like to say never met a slit he didnt like and in typical fashion this show was full of them But there were also other things happening new things that made this outing feel like Vaccarellos most diverse to date Take for instance the T-shirt and tank dresses printed with a closeup of his friend and muse Anja Rubiks face As they approached it became clear that the dresses werent printed at all but rather embellished with gradient clusters of studs depicting photographer Collier Schorrs portrait of the unmistakable model Just think of the Instagram possibilities Also novel Tattoo prints on crisp white cotton button-downs Vaccarello has a distinct point of view and until now there hasnt been much room in it for such decorative motifs But now that hes up and running at Versus Versacehe took his first solo bow there a week and a half agohes clearly set his mind to expanding the world of AV To that end he made a big push into denim the entry-level price-point item that can really goose a brands bottom line High-waisted styles one accessorized with a denim belt that grazed the rib cage will be about as forgiving as his hip-high slits but there were loose-fitting boyfriend jeans in the mix that will appeal to a broader swath of body types  Vaccarello also put his first bags on the runway The gold detailing on a pair of cross-body styles echoed the hardware that accented this collections strong military-influenced tailoring and its drapey jersey numbers Binx Walton fashions tomboy du jour looked terrific in the one-shoulder asymmetric-skirt bathing suit dress Best in show however goes to Edie Campbells fitted officers jacket and sexy black jeans$$Antonio Berardis stated theme for Spring was distressed glamour He got at it best at his show this morning via his use of transparency and his lacing and fringe The strongest look by far was a knit dress with a leotard-like top and a full skirt in a cobweb weave it was a bit of a shame he didnt explore that idea further But there were other similar nearly as nice touches such as the pieces composed in part of a knit done out of shiny filament-fine yarn or window-paned in sheer chiffon Meanwhile the most focused part of this collection were the looks in black crepe that featured skin-winking lacing that spilled out in fringe Much of the action here was going on in the back of these looks Many of Berardis diaphanous dresses and skirts came with long trains and a number of jackets tailored through the front opened up in back in soft pleats There were also evening coats with internal crystal straps that allowed the coats to be slung off the shoulders like a backpack a design nicked from activewear That wasnt a bad idea but it was one of several in this show that didnt seem fully thought through certainly not in relation to the collection as a whole Berardis intention throughout seemed to be to mix baroque formality with undone-looking or off-kilter shapes There was an appealing collection hiding somewhere inside this busy outing but overall it suffered from a too much of muchness$$After pausing to give his wife Patrizia a fervently Italian squeeze (youd get slapped for that anywhere else) Antonio Marras contemplated his board and said I start with the simple lines and the simple shapes But in the end I think normality is too boring I prefer eccentricity As do the Marras-ophiles who flocked backstage after this well-received show You can see why Season in season out he delivers variations on a template though with Marras sameness is a virtue that reflects a depth of imagination not its absence His vision is dense delightful and particular to him The Spring 16 collection was touched by the work of the state-imprisoned Soviet-era Armenian director Sergei Parajanov The fruit left on the front row was a nod to Parajanovs 1969 film The Color of Pomegranates the broken-plate print on the first three looks reflected his work while the richly dun palette ornamented headpieces and occasionally literal swerves into a broad-belted full-skirted folk-dress silhouette nodded to the culture Parajanov was persecuted for propagating As was a carpet-backed set of 14 Styrofoam boulders twined to the ceiling two of which were mysteriously elevated for a rush-to-the-cameras finale of models in refashioned vintage white shirts and dresses studded with stones and layered with embroidery The mass of the collection was Marrass signature dervish concatenation of tiered apron dresses full skirts wide pants and frock-coats splattered with broderie anglaise embroidered patchwork printed panels beading tweed and sequined appliqus There was a lovely fil coupe stamped with plated-print circles of tarnished gold silver and bronze The shoes ran a gamut from fabulous wood-soled platform sandals to bullet-toed embellished sneakers With very few exceptions this was a collection that looked easy to wear but was hard not to stare at As Marras put it I like a lot of things together$$Anya Hindmarch likes to pack her shows full of very English fun and games She has been known to build magic teacup rides into her runways and once bussed in a full chorus of male choir singers dressed as road workers for her traffic-themed presentation Hindmarchs fondness for all things British led her to the high street this season and she incorporated the branding of some of the UKs best-loved stores into her tongue-in-cheek designs If you grew up in London in the 80s you might have recognized the saying emblazoned across a tote bag that read Never Knowingly Undersold as the tagline for the famed department store John Lewis A pair of leather knee-highs was cleverly stamped with the logo for Boots Englands answer to Duane Reade Hindmarch showed that those cultural witticisms could be used in subtler ways too and the letters WHS (short for WHSmith the popular British newsagent and stationery store) were repeated in a cool graphic pattern which made for an unexpected take on logomania  The humor in those everyday references will likely be lost on Anya Hindmarch fans outside of British borders though Still the designer didnt lose the smiley faces from her handbags altogether The bite-sized additions to the collection like mini soda-can key ring purses will surely tickle the fancy of accessories fanatics the world over$$When Apiece Apart launched in 2008 its organizing principle was modularity Designers Laura Cramer and Starr Hout wanted all their clothes to mix and match togethernot just within collections but between seasons and over the years What those modular clothes lacked in romance they more than made up for in durability Longtime Apiece Apart fans will attest that they still wear looks from the earliest collections Modularity is no longer the organizing principle of the label Cramer and Hout have loosened the reins on their concept over the years making clothes that are versatile and un-faddish but that impart some emotional resonance They hit a sweet spot this season drawing on Luis Barragns emotional architecture for inspiration Cramer and Hout have long hewed to the look of Mexico and the Southwest and the elements of those aesthetics that they drew on here fit organically into the established Apiece Apart vernacular The tonal embroidery and hand-crochet in this collection was new for the brand but it didnt feel that way The designers also worked in proven silhouettes giving them just a touch of an updatethe easy dresses that could be cinched or worn loose continued an idea they debuted for Resort while the ruffled crop tops made for a flirty reiteration of one of their most popular shapes The real development was in the knits Alongside the excellent fine-cotton ribsanother continuation from Resortwere sweaters with lacelike texture and engineered knit pieces emblazoned with graphic stripes The engineered knit tube skirt and matching ruffled bandeau was a look with terrific pop and it made for a nice counterpoint to the gauziness of the collection overall Even the punchiest items still read as staples that would wear well over the yearsyou could even see them paired with pieces from the Apiece Apart debut$$With the exception of committing factual error to publication the hollowest feeling a fashion critic can experience is the sensation of tacking against the wind of consensus For at its essence fashion is a tautly wrought tumbleweed of aesthetic agreement So if everyone says A when you feel B about C does that make you a Z And like OMG This AquilanoRimondi collection prompted a mild shiver of that unlovely sensation Good luck with that said one powerful tastemaker as we bundled toward the door after this show Last-chance saloon summated another as we bundled preshow toward it Yet the most damning thing these eyes observed about this collection was the odd flash of meh The idea of wearing paillette miniskirts as oomphed-up belts over long-yolked menswear shirts wasnt deeply flatteringthe tip of the yolk dangled unfortunately The shirts themselves though were excellent especially an endearing short-sleeved one with proper dress shirt cuffs There were some interesting takes on the nightie/sleep slip as outwear ARs versions were scalpel sliced and when there came ruffle it was applied with a more censoriously resistant eye to abandon than most designers have succumbed to this season minimal romantic The transliteration of Warhol florals to paillette reliefs was efficiently OK And the X-ray white organza jacket that revealed the skeleton of its tailoring was strong yet even better when fully opaque and black AR seems to be languishing under a reputational cloud but this collectionwhile no life changersignaled shafts of sunlight$$It may be the labels first season with a slot on the New York Fashion Week show roster but Area sure knows how to make an entrance The brainchild of Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk today the brand took over an airy room at The Standard and set their vision to life with an uncanny 70s beauty ad writ large Makeup was in fact Springs prcis as seen through the lens of some kind of gauzy disco daydream Doe-eyed faintly dazed-looking models milled around vanity tables silk dresses came encrusted with smudges of silvery glitter and glossy nude foundation smears and baroque slippers with Perspex heels were    just plainly beautiful Glitter or no chromes got to shine too so the designers whipped up the blush tire-rim print seen on a textured cream trench Elsewhere they proposed plunging wrap-front minis and lithe maxi dresses befitting Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface one of the iridescent mesh gowns would look great on the red carpet The spare clothes that Fogg and Panszczyk (alums of Calvin Klein Collection and Emanuel Ungaro respectively) create and the Braille-like embossing that has been their signature since the brands 2013 inception resulted in a generally sporty lean aesthetic But this outing was one that showed a new dimension Opening Ceremony was an early retail coup for the brand After today other tastemakers are sure to follow suit$$Its been a big week for Arthur Arbesser one of Milans new generation of designers Last Friday he presented his first collection for the Italian sportswear company Iceberg and today an hour before his longtime former employer Giorgio Armani put on his own show Arbesser took his young eponymous brand to the runway for the first time There was already a sense of occasion It was a fact Arbesser opted to accentuate by recruiting his friend the composer and musician Jordan Hunt to play live music and by installing in the middle of the room a giant Balthus cat and a young woman who played the artists model on a low velvet chair Balthuss favorite subjects were adolescent girls and Arbesser used the famous painters oeuvre as a framework The models hair was scraped carelessly to the side with bobby pins and they wore white anklets with both their patent slingbacks and their Nikes The pubescent edge-of-innocence thing can go dreadfully wrong Its a tribute to Arbessers sensitive spirit and that of his collaborators that it didnt At 33 hes fairly youthful himself he gets how young women want to dress A paper-thin technical nylon coat and matching pants brought a sleek athletic edge to the collection that felt genuine But the stars were illustrator Agathe Singers lovely prints If the naive cat motif on a pair of overalls and a raincoat wont be for everyone the lively floral that appeared on a flirty little dress a pantsuit and a long-sleeved T-shirt gown will find admirers well past their teenage years This writer can attest to that$$The pile of sequins scattered haphazardly atop a bench caught Ashish Guptas eye as he and his team were in the studio doing research I thought they just looked beautiful the designer said So he thought why try and impose order when disorder looks so great Thus this Ashish collection memorably preambled with a group of girls who skated the runway variously wearing DIY-touched tracksuits a slip skirt a frayed and washed denim T-shirt and lairy-fairy dresses wreathed in tulle Like nigh on every look in his Spring 2016 theirs were speckled and heaped with Ashishs random-on-purpose drifts of candy-tone sparkle They also emanated a pleasing Larry Clarkish truculenceattitude basically Then the show-run started in earnest with another ka-boom On the left was Larry B the London DJ on the right was Jay Boogie the man in Look 2 is Maximillian The crowd whooped even harder When they got to the end of the runway they initiated what became another walk-the-floor flourish that ran through the show by tossing handfuls of sequins at the crowd Later Larry came out again in a spaghetti-strap slip illustrated with some pertinent details Ashish explained I always want my shows to be a celebration of subcultures And I felt that Larrys dress was an important statement in the context of Caitlyn Jenner but also racial issues too This was a show in which the overwhelming message was its rejection of categories through inclusion Because were all just little sparkles jumbled together There were some striking outfits in here toothe one-piece hybrids of sari and jeans most lovablybut that message was the thing$$Its all well and good to talk about the 70s 80s and 90s but theres a generation of young designers who were raised on Y2K values The trashy moody bad girls of the turn of the millennium loomed large in Ashley Williamss imagination for Spring a motley crew of fictional and real-life characters that started with Emily the Strange and ended with Avril Lavigne  The 27-year-old designer has a soft spot for a skaters wardrobeher boyfriend Palace Skateboards founder Lev Tanju sat in the front rowalthough this season the vibe was more Camden Market goth does Black Swan and PVC trenchcoats came emblazoned with a tag that read Ashley Williams Ballet School and were worn with black tutus demented tiaras and fishnet tights That unapologetically brazen attitude also speaks to the aesthetic of a certain stylish bad gal of our times and you can imagine Rihanna strutting her stuff in one of Williamss No Code of Conduct tees or in her slip dress printed with flies and laced up in neon straps After an age of buttoned-up minimalism its an exuberant and cheeky sexiness that cool young girls can relate to right now The striped and pointy elf hats though are perhaps a tad too bad to be good$$Greg Armas usually has a self-described meta backstory when it comes to his collections This time he focused on bringing back the wardrobes of disappeared heroines I started finding that a lot of interesting academic psychic explorer and adventurous avatar-type of individuals seem to disappear said Armas The classic examples were Amelia Earhart and Maria Orsic A hefty narrative which of course raises the question What would the mysteriously vanished duo wear Their closets were surprisingly pared back Armas reimagined Earharts look the day she disappeared as a slouchy white jumpsuit and a trenchcoat with an oversize collar More utilitarian and aviator influences were referenced in loose cotton trousers and a paisley bomber jacket As for Orsic a stunning German medium who performed sances during World War II and eventually disappeared in 1945 her hypnotic staples included a romantic crepe twist top with naval-skimming dcolletage and cascading shorts as well as a slinky red silk maxi dress When it came to Armass use of denim the personal styles of the two women merged more closely Think indigo denim overalls for Earhart and a set of optic white wide-leg denim trousers for Orsic a loose chambray shirtdress meanwhile could have been worn by either muse There was also a pair of jeans patchworked with vintage squares of varying washes each hailing from a different decadea piece that could work for any woman with a modern-day-daredevil sartorial flair$$For Tony Melillo it all goes back to the T-shirt He started his line ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo just under four years ago with a tightly edited range of tees tanks and sweats in neutral shades of white and black While his business has since grown to reach every corner of the modern girls wardrobe from leather joggers to work-ready suits the concept of the perfect T-shirt is still the heart of the brand Shoppers who discover ATM at department stores like Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue collect the drapey Modal tees by the armful and this season Melillo introduced the Schoolboy tee a boxy slightly androgynous cut that lends itself perfectly to high-rise jeans But even Melillos more high-concept pieces are designed with the T-shirt in mind A shimmering charcoal parka in his Spring lineup was actually made of coated jersey so the slick high-shine exterior had a soft familiar interior Similarly ATMs sharp suits were constructed from textured woven fabrics instead of stiff wool and they were paired withwhat elseT-shirts not blouses Relaxed elegance is how Melillo described his point of view It was easy for us to go into all these categories [after starting with T-shirts] as crazy as it may seem We just stayed true to the brand identity  As such Melillos collections are more about luxurious wearable clothes than specific references But Spring was loosely based on the art of travel People always say ATM is perfect for traveling so I was thinking about what a chic traveler would wear he said That isnt to suggest you should hit the airport in heels rather Melillos ribbed-knit sweatpants would look sleek not sloppy with white sneakers and say one of his neoprene blazers which would bounce back after being stuffed into your carry-on Of course his supersoft tees which are manufactured in Peru are perfect not only for planes trains and automobiles but for every aspect of your daily life too which is certainly a sweet spot to be in$$It was extra-unfortunate that the branding of Dashthe Italian detergent that Au Jour Le Jour signed a deal with to sponsor this show and whose logos were incorporated into the collectionwas so deeply reminiscent of Fresh the new fragrance launched at Moschino on Thursday Moschino has long been the don of ironic Pop Art appropriation of mass-branding into high fashion and although the AJLJ efforts to service its sponsors (logoed boots a finely produced knit miniskirt and shirt and some spangly slip dresses) were cute the advertorial nature of the exercise undermined it The point of Moschino for house founder Franco and current designer Jeremy Scott presumably was and is designing clothes to say something not just get paid Still the collection was lively The schtick consistent with the sponsor (Dash) was stains So sequined jeans vests and black suede boots appeared splattered by scarlet ketchup An opening section of sixties-eque mock croc color-blocked tartan suits and shifts worn over organza shirts were prettily polluted by more sequin stains of coffee and blood Splodges were turned into camouflage oozing contra-colored gloop ran down in panels on more colored faux croc and enamel stains were dripped onto paillette minis As street style fare this was good fun but the biggest stain in a collection full of them was that overly articulated commercial transaction$$Audra Danielle Noyes is a young designer having made her way nearly straight from her studies at Savannah College of Art and Design to Paris where she cut her teeth at Lanvin and John Galliano And so her Spring prcis was one no doubt informed by her own experiences which delved deeply into the metamorphosis of a young woman That idea came to life specifically in the notion of searching for freedom within control An airy striped cotton silk jacquard she explained at a preview nodded to the strings of a marionette a peplumed top with a cutout toyed with the idea of vulnerability At times that reference felt slightly labored you didnt need multilayered conceits to appreciate Noyess winning marriage of American sportswear and demi-couture sensibilities To wit a delicate trench in nude and blush with a full skirt or a grouping made up of panels of various shapes shades and opacity The latter were some of the collections loveliest pieces  With their generous volumes and polished brand of eccentricity Noyess clothes are sure to find fans among women who arent afraid of a flounce or a bold sleeve But that sensibility also gave way to plenty of versatile styles to round out the collection The designer has a real talent for feminine riffs on suiting Look no further than her windowpane cropped flares and slouchy blazer for evidence of that Shirting likewise was an emphasis tailored poplin pieces served as a counterpart to Noyess balloon-sleeved shifts and sculptural skirts There was a certain innocence heresome of it intentional and some you imagined a by-product of the newness of the line that made you keen to see whats next for Audra$$Bali or bust Awaveawakes Spring 16 collection served as a lush testament to time spent on the Indonesian island Designer Jaclyn Hodes didnt lose sight of her mo of organically luxe styles or allow the trip to set her adrift on a sea of the tangential Instead like last seasons Jaipur-hued outing it served as a lens through which to subtly reinterpret all the things that have earned her label its following the languid bias-cut slip dresses and the tops and skirts made for layering (informed by Hodess work as a stylist) There was plenty of lightness to be had here The substantial-feeling lushness of washed silk charmeuse has long been a hallmark of Awaveawake but in the interest of retail in the warmer months Hodes diffused her signature material with styles in easy-to-wear easy-to-care-for cotton Elsewhere Falls hardy cowl-neck sweatshirt came to feminine new life in a floral lace The designers clothes have an undeniably earthy even holistic quality to them but with sophistication to spare To wit Springs apron dress with its lithe body-skimming shape and plunging back With pieces like that shell make a sensualist out of every one of us yet$$On a flight not long ago Babyghost designers Joshua Hupper and Qiaoran Huang seated separately both watched Ultrasuede The Halston documentary set their minds to the idea of making a Spring collection in homage to the great man Still Hupper says the two were fully aware of their potential to get overzealous so rather than going full-throttle Studio 54 this season they asked themselves What if we were trying to do this Halston collection for the Gap That idea didnt necessarily come through so much in the final product (Babyghosts clothes have plainly too much of a point of view and too much idiosyncrasy to channel Gap in any palpable way) but it seemed to serve them well Despite the season this was a deliciously Goth-y lineup light in feel if not in reference The duo was inspired by Death Clarence E Flynns poem personifying the Big Sleep as a friendly force (Why do you fear me it begins I am your friend) So much so in fact that it came stitched in its entirety along with an elegiac-looking depiction of Death on sheer tops and frocks Most beautiful of all was on the transparent front panel of a twill skirt the undersides of its seams came dappled with gold lam spots in a nod to Halston The designers resisted other direct 70s references in favor of that and the transparent confetti-filled (thats Studio 54 natch) buttons on a printed shirt All those were nice feats unto themselves but still Babyghosts most commendable move this season was one of self-awareness Hupper We want to make clothing [girls] want not clothing we want them to wear That meant wisely continuing to pare back the disparate graphic elements that have characterized Babyghost in seasons past in favor of bewitching more basic pieces The pair also debuted a lower-priced range dubbed Stashhouse (muse stylist and Babyghost international playgirl Xiao Wen Ju was wearing one of the bombers at last nights presentation) It was the kind of strong effort that left you if not undaunted by the reaper keen to see what next season will bring$$Buenos Aires of the 50s Mark Badgley and James Mischka may have never made it there themselves having been born several years too late but the red carpet stalwarts imagined that milieu through a romantics lens as the basis of their Spring lineup From the suntanned skin that the designers said informed a blush-heavy palette to the butterflies and flora here was a depiction of BA straight out of some dreamy tourist brochure Idealized but never kitsch the pair embraced their prcis wholeheartedly integrating it into the labels classic silhouettes beautifully tailored by day and very sensual and elegant by night as Mischka put it backstage pre-show The tailoring came to life with a swingy warm-weather tweed shorts suit the nighttime mood in a hothouse-looking floral lace gown and a metallic brushstroke jacquard Backstage the designers offered that while their autumnal fabrics skew toward the more heavily encrusted here was a relatively breezy profusion of frothy lightweight tulles chiffons and georgettes Gold foil butterflies on a blush tulle gown had a certain heady charm to them Still generally Badgley and Mischkas simplest propositions spoke the loudest to wit the plunging ivory top and gold beaded trousers or a little caped black cocktail dress with a waterfall of bugle bead strands that cascaded down the back Though if youre looking for an everyday shift for the office well    look elsewhere Our day starts at 5 pm Mischka laughed backstage while Helen Mirren sitting front row called out an unapologetically glam strapless gown in white and metallic gold floral jacquard as her most coveted look$$There was a buzz at todays Baja East show Common Miguel and Mariska Hargitay were seated front row and while the brands shows have historically been well attended since its inception (just two years ago) there was a noticeably higher showing of the industrys top faces For Spring designers Scott Studenberg and John Targon reimagined their signature urban nomad through the lens of rave down to the polished take on kandi seen at models wrists and necks Where the past has seen the Baja East palette go sun-bleached and spare todays was a veritable riot of parrotlike shades red chiefly but saturated blues and greens too Those all came to life in a punchy tie-dye print (weve seen a rash of the stuff at the shows already but none so graphic as this take) spotted on silk caftans That print was mirrored in the many many multicolored bingo granny bling Swarovski crystals covering white sweatshirts and tees There was also a terrific multihued crochet dappled with iridescent sequins Backstage pre-show Studenberg said that ambisexual brand or not roughly 90 percent of Bajas business is womens As such starting with Resort the designers have been increasing their focus on proper womens clothesthat is to say less loungy pieces to complement those cashmere ponchos Here that yielded a tuxedo-style ivory dress with a knotted belt that came scattered in more Swarovski There was even soft tailoring in the form of a scarlet blazer with a slim shawl collar Bajas fortunes look promising Theyre CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists in key doors globally and a growing name within the industry Now Studenberg and Targon are in the market for a key investor The heightened commercial appeal of todays outing was a step toward that and from the looks of it the designers feel good about their odds Both they and their models took a post-show victory lap dancing all the way$$Alexander Wangs three-year stint at Balenciaga is over He went out dancing snapping selfies and twirling down the runway His swan song was the freest of any of the collections he did for the house and the most tender All in shades of ivory All paraded softly out on lace slippers All in soft natural fabrics like linen cotton and voile with gentle furling edges It looked effortless where the ones that preceded it felt effortful  Work began on this collection after the announcement was made that Wang and Balenciagas parent company Kering would not be renewing his contract At the time Wang said hed be refocusing his attentions on his signature label Maybe that awareness loosened him up Maybe he really hunkered down determined to go out on a high note Whichever its no small irony that his last and best collection for the brand was the one that was truest to his own bred-in-California sensibilities A remix of The Notorious BIGs iconic Going Back to Cali played on the soundtrack Bella Heathcote Riley Keough Zo Kravitz and other Hollywood friends of his with normal-sized not overly thin bodies grounded the show in reality Loungewear was at its soul with boxer shorts peeking above waistlines and bra tops exposed under quilted jackets  As relaxed as its vibes were a good deal of work went into the collections smocking ruching and ladder stitching and yet it remained light When you know its your last anything you say Lets take a risk what do you have to lose Wang said backstage At a house thats known for innovation I thought Lets think about it the opposite way lets think about fabrics and shapes that feel supple and simple but approach them in an artisanal couture way  Following Nicolas Ghesquire the innovator Wang was referring to had to be one of the toughest jobs in fashion As Wang sped back down the runway tonight he nearly tripped over one of the shows reflecting pools before catching himself and continuing backstage It was a pointed image His own show was bigger than ever and one of the highlights of the New York calendar The question isnt how Wang will fare now but how Balenciaga will pick up the momentum again$$There was a glint of genius in Pablo Coppolas context-setting question for this collection which ran What will the bourgeois woman in 20 years time want to wear Why genius Well the bourgeois woman of today is wearing a 90s-touched but 70s-heavy constellation of signifiers upgraded by the appropriation of post-sportswear streetwear So it follows that a woman 20 years on will wear something heavily touched by whatever hindsight dictates is nowright nowin 2015/16 shot through with a lot from the 90s and made relevant by technology and trends that we cant even begin to anticipate Were Coppola able to answer his question he would have discovered the Holy Grailfashions Flux Capacitora way to short-circuit the self-referential cycle of retrospection and push on into Where We Really Are The essence of Now So did he  It would of course be impossible to be truly sure but this didnt look like a bad bet A double-breasted shirtdress full length in heavy silk crepe bore the six-buttoned imprint of functions pastabout as useful as an appendix yet reassuring somehowin a fundamentally minimal garment The cream suiting had a flecked rustication to its finishCoppola said the intention had been to ape the raggedness of a toile but made ready-to-wear Not in the lookbook but well worth a look were silk-mix bombers in olive and blush pink with cutely pop-openable backs to flash the spine that ideally genderless post fourth-wave feminism erogenous zone There were foulard prints and hand-finished fringing and suspiciously perfect moth holes that were all inserted to heighten the sense of a garment crafted by hand Next to the main collection workers from Ballys recently acquired exotic leather atelier had been brought in to emphasize this still further Inauthentically however their day-to-day tools had been confiscated for being too aesthetically unpleasing One poor chap was heating his edging iron on a scented candle

proposition has had a year to bed on Bond Street It will be rolled out in 12 international locations over the next 12 monthsfirst stop Los Angeles With collections such as these to fill them Ballys new stores will feel relevant in 2016 And perhaps in years hence too$$Olivier Rousteings Balmain show has become such a magnet for fans and paparazzi that the police shut down the street outside the entrance to his Hotel Intercontinental venue today Without Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West in the front row the scene inside was much more subdued than last season Rousteings own social media fame may not be at the level of the Kardashian clan but when it comes to designers few can touch him Only Jeremy Scott and Riccardo Tisci come close  His online following made him an ideal candidate for the H&M collaboration going on sale next month a point Rousteing made explicit in his notes While this 15-minute presentation is designed to create strong impressions and reactions its during the upcoming six months when the designs will make their mark Social medias embrace of Balmain will provide us with daily reminders of the excitement of those who have found a new way to bypass traditional gatekeepers Implicit in that statement was a riposte to his fashion-world detractors of which there will likely be many after todays show  Rousteing toned down the color this season to focus on shades of nude but there was no equivalent dialing-back of the embellishments that have weighed down his recent collections The macram was as full-on as ever and often in crystals or beads and the tiered ruffles were even more flamboyant than last seasons silk pliss Those ruffles notwithstanding the silhouette was super clingy loaded with cutouts and sheer paneling and cinched with waist trainersize belts Joan Smalls slithered down the runway in short stretchy green suede the shows best look but the restrictive tight-fitting tube skirts gave other models problems As excessive as it all came off at todays show these clothes look great in pictures Rousteings macram really resonates on a tiny iPhone screen the proof is in the Spring 16 outfits Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid wore last night on the town in Paris #BalmainBooties and #BalmainBeauties temporarily replaced #BalmainArmy as Rousteings hashtag du jour Who needs gatekeepers The guys going to sell millions at H&M$$Creative director Marissa Webb is pushing Banana Republic in a new direction meaning revamped patterns and new textures for both womenswear and menswear In another important switch-up for the label this collection also represented BRs first partnership with the CFDA via a collaboration with New York designer Timo Weiland and partners Alan Eckstein and Donna Kang All the changes were noticeable For womenswear Webb refreshingly shook up her pattern palette with a polished cream jumpsuit which came in a blotted watercolor floral print A pair of wide-leg trousers striped in white and aqua offered a subdued cool There was also a look in biting pink scale hues that caught the eyea striped salmon topper thrown over a lavender pleated frock But it was Webbs focus on suiting that packed an understated and chic punch without a deliberate changed-up feel An off-white slouchy jacket and trouser set as well as a jacket that was rendered into a vest were both casual enough to be worn as separates with jeanssomething that Webb was also aiming for  Likewise suiting received a makeover when it came to menswear A manicured downtown approach was seen in a dandy-style shorts suit with a fitted double-breasted jacket that included a pocket square For a more relaxed look there was also a suede jacket paired with knee-skimming shorts   One of the most refreshing additions came with Weilands work There was an uptown elevation and a glossy take on prep that could translate for BR consumers outside of Weilands metropolitan home base His riff on cocktail wear was great a high-waisted wide-pleated salmon skirt paired with a cropped tank and a sharp chambray shift dress It was a good way for BR to infuse a dose of authentic city-side cool while also introducing new talent to the traditional customer$$There is that rock n roll side and a sexy suita little bit boyish you know Its what I love to do gushed Barbara Bui air-kissing German photographer Ellen von Unwerth backstage at her Spring show today And if its what Barbara loves to do then its what Ellen loves to photographsexy uncomplicated clothes that do double-time as a flamboyant urban wardrobe for the jet set or perhaps those aspiring to join it Underscored as a love letter to Bianca Jagger Buis Spring collection traced a racy through line going from urban tailored separates (safari-tinged shirtdresses and city shorts or their romper equivalents) to wrapped bra tops and leggings all cut in supple leather Her material of choice channeled a retro lan when patchworked as a harlequin snakeskin suit or an 80s shock in hot pink napa It would take little imagination to picture a young Jagger poolside in the former option or one of the seasons silk slipdresses trapped by sculpted corset belts at the waist their plunging necklines revealing bikinis beneath Later Bui took a gaucho trip involving fringed ponchos in tan or aubergine suede for a South American theme that evolved into silk fringed eveningwear the designer called night owl embroidery (a suit and gown were positively festooned with the stuff) Those pieces swung past begging for serious dance-floor real estate but its probably the no-fuss sex appeal of Buis daywear that will lure her ladies in Hell for leather if you will$$Strong Absolutely Serene No diggity But can minimalism ever be sexy While thats a pretty subjective questioneverythings something to someoneon the whole youd think nope Minimalisms (putatively) intellectual commitment to distillation of form and austerity of delivery is just too cold to be hot Yet today sometimes that was sort of what Barbara Casasola was pitching for in this collection And impressively she sometimes sort of succeeded My woman is very sensual she said post-show and thats what I do is about Her baseline daywear proposition starred loosely languid tailoring (smashing jackets) finely rendered silk bowling shirts and some comely high-waisted silk pants that had the puckered texture of paper splashed with water and left to dry again The hot stuff was a more ambitious series of fitted dresses and jumpsuits cast in polyester-spiked pliss taffeta and textured knit silk Although mostly either monochrome or day-spa dark rusty-neutral in tone Casasola variously oomphed them up with Bardot necklines grids of tiny incisions cutaways at the abdomen or lines of larger welts in the material that ran down the side of her outfits from shoulder to hem to achieve what the press notes coyly termed a fragile reveal Casasola rather short-circuited this interplay between inhibition and abandon with a section that beachily whispered of her Brazilianness most notably in a roughly woven full-length green skirt partnered with an (unreliable) bandeau and gleaming gold totem jewelry This designer spent a few years at Roberto Cavalli and although she correctly observed that his and her aesthetics are very differentoh yesshe learned enough from the old devil to make this an at-times-effective exercise in date-night minimalism$$An eight-day trip to England proved fertile ground for Barbara Tfank who based her Spring 2016 collection called My Journey on the various sites she visited on her travels Tfank and her husband were invited to lunch by a deputy speaker of the House of Lords and the designer had a chance to visit the storied hall at the Palace of Westminster I was so taken by the decor and these perfectly maintained 19th-century roomsthe ornateness of the wall treatments the moldings and the fabrics said Tfank That lent itself organically to Tfanks textile-centric design sensibility There were plenty of brocades tinged with metallic embroidery that would have looked just spiffy in an 1800s-era sitting room Of course thats not always an ideal thing Theres a reason the palace is considered a historical site and some of Tfanks creations came off a tad antiquated an impression not helped by the upswept retro hairstyle Her inspiration translated best on a pink-and-green brocade column gown with a back panel a dress that reminded one of the kind of chintz curtains of the era and yet still somehow managed to feel fresh Also fresh a handful of evening separates including a full brocade skirt with contrasting leather waistband styled with a crop top that might entice some younger customers$$Every season we pick a destination but this time its Southern California Los Angeleswere staying right here Lubov Azria in gray post-summer NYC thusly granted a final blissfully warm day with her BCBG Max Azria lineup Surf skate musicthe ways California changed the world but a new proposal  First things first More than a few front-rowers were Snapchatting (though with limited cell service inside Moynihan Station) the patchwork bucket hats Yes Azria has made the bucket hat cool again Below the toppers it was all layers like embroidered vests lightweight knits tie-dyed T-shirts and floor-dusting pants some in twilight-hued blocked gradients Ventura with polish and smart styling  At points there was even a hint of Burning Man among all the Coachella such as in the case of a metallic gold jacquard jacket That may have been inspired by the Pacifics bronze glow on one of Azrias marathon training runs through Toluca Lake With platform cutout-toe boots cozy bits like knit leg warmers and a few great beach dresses it felt good to soak up the sun one last time$$When there are two designers who run a labellet alone two siblingsyou cant help but wonder how often they clash behind the scenes For Beaufilles Parris Gordon and Chlo Gordon sisterly disagreements are inevitable but their unique lifelong bond also makes them ideal collaborators Chlo whose background is in textiles knows which knits or tech fabrics will work best with Parriss hardware and jewelry (Parris studied metalsmithing) and vice versa From there the collection sort of unfolds organically and Spring was particularly harmonious In the past we would think of really specific inspirations and start there but now we kind of work backward Parris explained Were working more intuitively Of Spring 16s sharp lines silver ring cutouts and high-tech materials she said We immediately thought it looked retro-futuristictheres a Star Warsin-the-70s quality That mood came through best in a mid-length ivory slip dress with D-rings and trailing ribbons at the shoulders Slips are a huge trend for Spring but theyve been a Beaufille best-seller for a few seasons now Elsewhere the ring details became more prominent creating pockets of air on a sleeveless jacket or dotting the curved edge of a dress Cropped flares with chunky zippers also stood out both the rust suede and black jersey varieties would give your favorite jeans a run for their money In addition to that minimal sculptural theme there was an emphasis on more artisanal details like a one-shoulder top that looked like it was made of tangled threads Chlo handmade it by throwing bundles of yarn into water-soluble bags pinning the strings together and embroidering them over and over for hours at a time Then she dunked the mass in a bathtub and watched the bags dissolve so all that was left was the manipulated fabric Consider it a modern take on lace or crochetwith just a touch of high tech$$How better to purge any lingering associational residue of Belstaffs first luxury womenswear iterationwhich was just too hard uptight and uptown to be consistent with this free-wheeling biker brands identitythan with a vigorous salt wash Delphine Ninous dappled this collection with a seascape print that featured on jacquard turtlenecks reversible double-layer organza and shiny nylon bombers and the opening asymmetrical silk dress She had been thinking of the ocean and the elements and so forth she said This set the tone for a concerted exercise in softening through gentle erosion Field jackets bore the utilitarian hoo-ha of military taping and poachers pockets but on treated linen or a silky featherlight technical material worn over an earthy oatmeal Guernsey The biker was recast in jersey-bonded stretch suede a really impressive fabrication with shoulder guards and small-of-the-back corrugations in lightly crackled leather Matching pants too There was a sleeveless hybrid of dress and coat decorated with the neckline quilting hardware and leather strapping of Ninouss materialswhich made for quite a muster of references The designer confessed that a significant part of her role is to investigate this amazing archive of DNA from Belstaff and think Okay how can I tweak it but she is also empowered sometimes to roam off-road After all there was nothing biker in her wide lace-paneled white cotton pants or in the fine entwined peep-toe sandals orstrapping apartin the loose linen striped overcoats And thats all for the good Incorporating house codes makes a fine starting point but from there on its time to take off$$Bernhard Willhelms latest collection was totally bananas Literally Bananas were Willhelms inspiration this season and his clothings key motif There were embroidered banana designs elaborated with loops of fringe a print of a man eating a banana three-dimensional banana appliqus and more The bananas were ludicrousnot to mention suggestivewhich was precisely Willhelms point The designer was celebrating randomness in this ostentatiously cheerful outing which featured lots of sliced and distressed square-cut clothes and zero instances of the color black  Willhelm was being playful but his is serious play To engage with his clothes means engaging with the idea that people could dress in a way far removed from what we see on the street today The naivet of his methodsthe knotting and slashing and seemingly improvisational drapingas well as his touches of applied damage like dip-dye or shredded hems all together suggested a uniform worked out spontaneously by a lost tribe of club kids who had decided to make a society of their own from scratch In said society gender is a nonissueyou wear what you likeand it just so happens that one of the members of this new utopia is a master maker of intarsia knits with access to hand-embroiderers in India and placement printers in Japan Which is a roundabout way of noting that Willhelms clothes may look bananas but the designer himself is not Theres both method and sophistication to his madness$$The Betsey Johnson show is always an over-the-top extravaganza an unhinged get-together and a wild culmination of many inspirations Today there was another raging party backstagea clamor of models in sky-high heels and bass-thunking raps by Azealia Banks But though Johnson was in her vivacious element she still paid attention to some serious themes the 73-year-old designer pulled out a tank top with an American flag on it that she designed in 2001 Its for 9/11 Ive saved it all these years she said Im going to wear it for the fireman After all Johnson has seen a lot in her time as a designerand today was also a celebration of her 50 years in the fashion industry On top of that there was a point person she had to thank as well Two hours before the show Johnson arranged a car to pick up her 94-year-old dance instructor Ann Pimm to attend the show Ive dedicated the show to her said Johnson I studied with her forever and she brought me to New York to study With dance as the theme as well as her five decades of experience in the industry Johnson squeezed half a century onto the runway The first looks were set in the present with Nicki Minajesque pieces like a bubblegum corseted tutu dress on top of a neon blue net shirt As for the 90s Johnson gave grunge a playful riff with rose-patterned tutu dresses fastened with blue corsets paired with cherry print tights There was also the rock attitude of the 80s which included jumpsuits with punchy pinstripes and a very cool plastic jacket outfitted with zippers on the sleeves  But it was the 60s that introduced the most wearable looks There was a strong Twiggy influence in a mod-style Mandarin-collar striped pantsuit as well as a polka-dotted minidress with an oversize collar and sleeves Baring some skin there was a slinky violet dress with the naval-skimming dcolletage opening bound by mini bows The last looks which hailed from the 50s were the most sentimental Johnson designed the pieces based on her original dance costumes as a child There were charming nude leotards adorned with mini frills at the waist and striped with sequins as well as a bedazzled red crop top and a pleated miniskirt For the grand finale before Johnson did her traditional cartwheel she handed Pimm a bouquet of flowers Then she was followed by models in leotards printed with American flags proving that the designer always remembers the important things$$Im a very emotional designer Bibhu Mohapatra said before his Spring 2016 show Whether its a fabric or a material or an artisan story I hold on to them until it feels right As a counterpoint to last season when Mohapatra was mourning the loss of his father the designer wanted this collection to be much more spirited and celebratory He chose as his muse Annemarie Schwarzenbach a woman who has long held his fascination and whom the designer felt embodied the joie de vivre of the collection Schwarzenbach was a trailblazera glamorous and itinerant journalist and photographer who was known for her singular androgynous style in 30s Europe But she also died young at the age of 34 She had a short but very impactful life and thats something to be celebrated said Mohapatra Instead of riffing on Schwarzenbachs menswear-influenced personal stylewhich would have strayed too far from the brands core aestheticMohapatra instead opted to infuse his feminine and sophisticated silhouettes with elements of Bauhaus the school of art that Schwarzenbach subscribed to Mohapatra beautifully captured that modernist and geometric style in his prints many of which were inspired by discarded Bauhaus drawings Highlights included a warped circle print that repeated itself on tops and dresses and an overblown multicolored design iridescent with sequins that appeared on dresses and pants Elsewhere Mohapatra incorporated elements of the schools architectural aesthetic Thigh-high slits were effectively updated by squaring off the opening at the topa nice graphic touch Dresses and tops had structure and often were sliced to reveal surprising panels of tulle and silk organza Mohapatra is also emotionally invested in the fabrics he uses and the artisans he works with The designer could barely suppress his excitement backstage when showing a jacket constructed from thin strips of leather and silk that was hand-woven in Laos Surprisingly delicate and fascinating to look at up close the fabrication was certainly worth the fuss$$In the wake of founder Johan Lindebergs departure back in May BLK DNM has opted to move forward without appointing a successor instead leaving design duties up to the studio team Lindebergs vision for the brand has left them a concrete aesthetic vernacular to be built upon Spring 16 marks his last season a collection handled in part by him and in part by the in-house talents Here Lindebergs chief preoccupationsfreewheeling 60s and 70s rock n roll sensibilities quintessentially embodied by everyone from Keith Richards and Gram Parsons to Patti Smithcame to life in wearable 21st-century ways  There was plenty of common ground between this and the seasons menswear offering and why not Chances are the BLK DNM girls beau dresses as well as (if not better than) she does Consider a whiskey-color jacket decked out in yards of fabulous shuddering fringe that same fabrication came to life as a sweet Jane Birkinesque shift too Quiet touches like pony beads spotted dangling off the zips of a leather jacket were proof that the devil is in the detailsand that those details add appeal that goes a long way in setting BLK DNMs takes on well-trod iconic pieces apart from the pack Likewise tailoring has always been a strong suit of the lines and the revival of an old silhouettethe terrific shawl-collar Blazer 32could scarcely be more timely Not long before the launch of this collection Kendall Jenner was spotted out and about in a vintage iteration of the style$$A house fondness for bloom-bordered sheerness makes Blumarine a show thats relished by the bawdy band of runway photographersits their Friday morning double espresso Outside the pit however that emphasis on garlanded nudity can feel unsettlingly anachronistic Yet to be understood Blumarine needs first to be examined in terms of its anthropology Anna Molinaris line reflects an Italian sensibility a Chi magazine (Italy's answer to Us Weekly) reader's raunch-touched interpretation of ethereal romance that Blumarine fueled by its original success in knitwear manufacturing gave rise to  And the audience at todays show was ample evidence that this constituency is still in fine fettle Thus the screen-print stemmed-rose-silhouette tulle skirts shirts and gowns sometimes monochrome sometimes in a reduced-rainbow palette accented with stripes A jacket of pastel-sequined camouflagedesigned to help you blend out of the backgroundwas worn over a flower-appliqud silk smock in violet beach stripe and some superwide cut-at-the-side pink Bengal-stripe pants Those pants pointed to the unexpected element in this lineup Just as Rodolfo Paglialunga did for his debut Jil Sander collectionSpring 201512 months ago team Blumarine turned to the completely fabulous androgynous-dressing progenitor Swiss photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach for its thematic inspiration Schwarzenbach very much is a now-appropriate cipher and the interpretation of her here was expressed in high-cut loosely pocketed hardware-shorn field jacketbiker hybridsand those pants This was Blumarines nod to gender fluidity and along with the masculine accent of that Bengal stripe it reflected a sincere effort to flavor the house cocktail with a fresh dose In chambray especially and black satin up to a point it kind of convinced Although the photographers were disappointed$$Julianne Moore wore a Le Smokingstyle jumpsuit by Bosss Jason Wu at the Toronto International Film Festival last weekend She looked fantastic The strapless black jumpsuit reappeared on the runway this afternoon but its formality meant it was an outlier in Wus new collection for the German brand Now in his fourth runway season hes focused on growing the Boss universe To do so he focused mostly on daywear of the decidedly breezy variety for Spring  To start he gave the Boss suit a makeover elongating the jacket hacking off the sleeves and adding fringe to the lapels full trousers were cropped above the ankle The tailoring felt airier than his previous work here and freer even when the jackets had full sleeves The same goes for his dresses Who knows why but Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have emerged as a significant New York trend not only on the runways but also on the street Wu used them to winning effect cutting delicate sleeveless dresses in bright shades of flame red cobalt and lemon yellow organza Their split skirts and handkerchief hems swirled weightlessly as they came down the runway Until now Wu has avoided prints at Boss Giving them a go today he experimented with an etched gray-tone floral It felt a bit anemic side by side with the Bauhaus colors of the pleated dresses A pair of sheaths in a two-tone woven tweed with frayed edges were bolder All in all an assured outing$$The great outdoors was calling this morning at Bottega Veneta Its Indian summer here in Milan and everyone working in the city is trying to hold on to that serene vacation mood while the sunshine lasts So is Tomas Maier it seems as he showed a collection inspired by big country open air trekking and sailing The farther he can get from an urban environment he says the better it gets With the exception of teenagers most everybody can relate to that impulse and Bottega Veneta has never been for the underage anyway Maiers self-appointed task is to get inside the desires of women with money to spend and for Spring he is persuading them to crave more casual clothes He opened with looks evolved from tracksuits with zippered jackets and cropped pants throughout his daywear he wove a brownish-green camouflage theme patched in with leopard print On the feet flat loafers thong sandals and clogs Still theres no avoiding the fact that Bottega Venetas customers must eventually face the city and its various social occasions So for the urban jungle there was a tailored pantsuit and blouse printed in Maiers abstract camo patternnot exactly designed for merging into the background but rather for standing out from the herd as a bold fashion-adopter (printed pantsuits have been head-turners at Gucci Versace and Roberto Cavalli too) There was one intricately pieced red leather and python coat and several patchworked shift dresses that radiated the kind of highly crafted exclusiveness Bottega Veneta fans love What do you do when you want to bring a sense of the big outdoors to party dresses though Maiers solution frocks in techno-cottons ingeniously wrapped and grommeted with slim guy-ropes as shoulder straps They werent exactly tents but some of them had that feeling about them Maybe for a woman whod secretly rather spend her summer nights under the stars$$Tatiana Maslany the Canadian star of Orphan Black wore an ivory Le Smoking by Bouchra Jarrar to the Emmys last month Admittedly there wasnt much in the way of competition but she was easily among the chicest women at the ceremony elegant where other actresses looked try-hard or just plain wrong Its nice to see Hollywood waking up to Jarrars red carpet potential shes putting a new emphasis on dress-up clothes at her couture shows For ready-to-wear presented in her premier arrondissement atelier which is becoming increasingly crowded as the seasons progress shes focused on a more everyday kind of elegance  In a first for Jarrar there was a tailored pantsuit in a dark-rinse denim the softness of which defied expectations Softness was truly the order of the day be it a caramel-color shrunken leather blouson and matching skirt with an arching slit or a navy viscose trench with a high storm flap and epaulets But Jarrar was equally concerned with the collections graphic punch juxtaposing the high-contrast animal print of an elongated gilet with the black lace of a long-sleeved top or piecing together a sexy asymmetrical tank top with patent shoulder straps from diagonal slices of tech fabric and leather We cant help circling back around to her smoking jackets though Does anyone anywhere cut one better$$For a first-time designer Brandon Maxwell knows what hes doing With the uptown location of Mr Chow as his show venue and a guest list so edited every name read as a Who's Who of the fashion world Maxwell had the odds stacked in his favor at his premiere New York Fashion Week presentation That says nothing of the fact that he joins the design community as Lady Gagas longtime stylist who has covered magazines arm in arm with the singer and who calls Gaga's frequent collaborators Steven Klein Alexander Wang and Inez and Vinoodh his friends Then there was Gaga herself perched front row in one of his designs cheering on models as they walked by and breaking into tears of joy as the finale gowns brushed passed her In a season where designers are striving for intimate personal settings Maxwell truly nailed it  But what of the clothes With power women as his starting point Maxwell sent out sharply tailored separates in black ivory and a dusty rose culminating in several over-the-top gowns Nearly every look featured some element of ridged pleating a motif derived from Maxwells childhood practice of dressing up his sisters in bed sheets and fastening them with his fathers cummerbunds The effect worked best when it was used minimally like on the lapels of second-skin dinner jackets or around the waist of tailored trousers A high-neck white wrap dress and black billowy-sleeved frock edged into costume territory the sort of things that could only be pulled off by someone with a commanding presence to rival Gagas For those looking for just a touch of diva wed recommend the cut-to-there minidress on Ophelie Guillermand Sexy without question but a little better suited for off-stage activities$$Brock Collection is still a relatively young label but husband-and-wife duo Kris Brock and Laura Vassar have already established their signatures Theyre proponents of an unfussy femininity thats rooted in luxe fabrics and simple silhouettes Brocade in particular is a Brock staple its appeared in every collection thus far from midi-length skirts to billowing floor-grazing shirtdresses For Spring the textures were even more opulentsee the hand-embroidered cotton dresses and ivory python pencil skirt Those items took elevated daywear to an entirely new place Brock and Vassars point of view is more about subtle flourishes than specific themes but they did cite architecture as an influence We designed the collection while we were living at my parents house which my mom designed Vassar explained at their peaceful High Line Room presentation Its all Gustavian and Swedish style so its really simple and beautiful with clean lines So we were thinking a lot about restraintI think its harder to restrain yourself than it is to go overboard Where they could have added more structure or embellishment to their garments they held back One of the best examples of this philosophy was actually made up of two classics a striped shirt that extended to the floor (and could also be worn as a dress) layered over cropped jeans Mixing in those casual humble textures is another Brock signature ensuring the clothes feel special but not precious These were luxurious pieces meant to be worn in your real life a point that was highlighted by the models footwear Each look was paired with flat python sandals a new category for the designers Heres hoping Brock bags are next$$The charm of irregularity is how Brunello Cucinelli described the spirit of his Spring collection a lineup of fluid shapes in creamy whites where raw textures took center stage Inspired by the elegant beach resorts of the Annes Folles and the sophisticated yet dgag style of the decadent elites of that era who holidayed in Deauville and Biarritz the style was relaxed and soft with a subtle retro feel A touch of modernity was added through references to the Japanese love of organic materialstheir traditional streamlined minimal lines and sophisticated cutting techniques Embracing imperfections is a fascinating concept because it mirrors nature and the flow of life itself said a dapper Cucinelli pointing out sweaters knitted with raw hemp dusters cut from buttery-soft raw silk and cardigans in corrugated yet supersoft yarns Pants were the foundation of the collection which despite the exotic visual inspiration was rooted in practicality and wearable day looks Ankle-grazing culottes were gathered and softly pleated at the waist a wraparound skirttrouser hybrid looked modern Paired with a pearl gray shaved mink sleeveless top it added a touch of luxe to the lineup Jackets were elongated and masculine with a relaxed feel due to the use of ultra-lightweight fabrics Garonne-style cardigans recalled the sophisticated insouciance and the sporty elegance of the 20s but were given the signature Cucinelli treatment Crafted with raw precious fibers they were deconstructed to achieve a sort of chubby yet fluid effect Id like my style to be extremely versatile day-to-night ageless timeless perfect for women of all ages and sizes he enthused Case in point His elegant wife and their two young daughters were on handand all looking at ease clad in head-to-toe Cucinelli$$Burberry's heritage might be centuries old but Christopher Baileys vision for the brand is relentlessly forward-thinking Twenty-four hours before the lights went up on the Burberry Prorsum runway a sneak peek of the collection was staged on Snapchat Having recently announced a partnership with Apple Music it seems the CEO and chief creative is forging ahead with other tech and sound alliances too and attendees of todays show were treated to a mini concert by Alison Moyet a video of which will be launched exclusively with the music-sharing service Performing with a 32-piece orchestra Moyets ethereal vocals set the darkly romantic tone of the show and the first model was dressed in head-to-toe blacka thigh-grazing lace minidress classic trenchcoat sporty rubber-soled sandals and a nylon backpack That mishmash of techy sportswear and delicate vintage-inspired eveningwear was cut with militaristic details throughout Peacoats came studded with brass Sgt Pepperstyle regimental buttons and slinky satin silk skirts were finished with metallic cording of the kind you might find on a soldiers uniform In fact they were made by the same embroiderers that decorate the coats of the Queens Guard just a stones throw away at Kensington Palace Clearly homegrown production values are still on the agenda and much of the lace was made in the UK too Bailey never fails to keep the bigger picture in mind though and he explained backstage after the show that for him the idea of traditional seasons has essentially become obsolete Showing those pretty 40s-inspired slips with a cozy sheared mink coat as well as light summer trenchcoats makes sense in a global market  And speaking of slip dressinga trend that has been inescapable on both sides of the pondKate Moss the woman who took the look to the world stage in the 90s was sitting in the front row next to Londons current reigning cool girl Cara Delevingne With a social media following in the millions the model turned actress has an enormous sphere of influence The counterintuitive styling of the show where a hoodie and a bias-cut silk dress can happily coexist in the space of one look had modern verve and spoke to the kind of #OOTDs that live in her Instagram feed After the Internet frenzy for Burberrys Fall 2015 monogrammed blanket the brands new nylon backpack which was embroidered with Delevingnes initials and sat in her lap today is likely to go viral just as quickly$$For several seasons a visit to the Cacharel showroom has been prefaced with the same party line about rediscovering the brand heritage and modernizing it for today And its tough to take umbrage with clothes that are intentioned unchallenging and more often than not patterned in flowers Aside from a venue change to new well-appointed headquarters on the Left Bank not much has changed Which is not necessarily a criticism The lookbook shot by millennial photographer Alexandra Sophie refers to the Cacharel style as Lady 20 a catchall that neatly encompasses the signature drop-waist dresses lace polo tops and a novelty trench printed with pastel canaries Indeed the design studio continues to propose a variety of stylized florals (this time anemones poppies peonies and a vintage botanical print) alongside everyday overcoats breezy blouses and respectable skirts all corresponding in proportion and palette One update Cacharel collaborated with Notify jeans and the boyfriend styles offset the range of romantic blouses from embroidered mousseline to broderie anglaise Oh and another A stand-alone store in the French capital is scheduled to open sometime next year By then perhaps we will see a bit more originality in a way that generates excitement for a deserving brand The new office is a stones throw from the Muse dOrsay home to some of the most beautiful flower paintings ever created Just a thought$$Calvin Klein designed an era-defining collection of slip dresses for Spring 1994 The models in that showKate Moss Bridget Hall Michele Hickswent on to rule the runways for a decade and the dress became a house icon The only piece of clothing Klein might be more famous for is his instantly recognizable logo briefs Twenty-odd years later perhaps thanks to Internet-fueled nostalgia or maybe greater cultural forces contemporary designers are looking back at those early 90s days Those skimpy silk frocks were all over the New York shows this week including at Francisco Costas excellent offering for Calvin Klein Collection today  Costa is well-versed in the labels heritage but the new Calvin Klein Collection slip dresses are different from the ones of old Call it grunge deconstruction Theyre slack at the bust extra straps dangle every which way and knit versions stitched with brass chains fray and disintegrate towards the hem Costa imagined the morning after a liaison when a woman might toss her lovers tailored jacket and too-big pants over her lingerie and the tailoring too got the deconstruction treatment Pant hems unraveled jacket hems were partially sliced away and sleeves extended almost to the fingertips or were sliced up the seam halfway to the elbows It was new to see Costa embrace the disarray in the past hes erred on the side of orderly  The collections biggest surprise was the photo prints of flowers that appeared on dresses pants and a trench alike Costa doesnt usually show that much pattern on his runway Its rarer still for it to have such sweet connotations Heres hoping he indulges his romantic impulses again sometime soon$$Camilla Freeman-Topper and Marc Freeman shot the lookbook for their new collection inside Frank Gehrys recently opened paper bag building in Sydney a new wing of the citys University of Technology The buildings swirling metallic interior wasnt the inspiration for the siblings new clothes but it may as well have been This outing was all about curvilinearity refraction and controlled swoops of volume The volume story came through with greatest force in this collections trumpet-shaped sleeves and skirt hems High-necked tunics and densely knit off-the-shoulder tops with bell-like silhouettes echoed the theme and numbered among this outings standout pieces This was a notably restrained and sophisticated effort for Camilla and Marcthe froth was curtailed to diaphanous silk and velvet burnout dresses that were understated enough to sit nicely with the collections classically glam draped silk satin looks for evening The flourishes likewise erred toward a high tonesome decorous eyelash fringe a touch of metallic The sprightliest looks here were the ones that featured holographic polka dots woven into lightweight black jacquard The other graphic pop here came from Camilla and Marcs abstract print which picked up on the waves built into the collections drapes and flares The print was attractive and eye-catching but what stuck with you about this collection were the subtler effects in particular the ways that Freeman and Freeman-Topper incorporated a sense of openness and fluidity into their generally attenuated silhouettes The line was long and lean but not constricted Lots of women will appreciate that$$The Frick Collection has never opened its doors for a fashion show Over the years many designers have asked but the answer was always no This season Carolina Herrera heard yes The skylit atrium is a transporting place its Beaux Arts grandeur might have tempted Herrera to look back in time for inspiration but shes a resolutely modern-minded designer She has been quick to embrace high-tech materials and figure out ways to incorporate them into her tony uptown aesthetic This season more than ever she put them to work  On a preshow tour through her backstage dressing area the buzzword was pleats but not old-fashioned pleats Herreras are trompe loeil narrow bands of tech fabric stitched onto transparent mesh of different densities Sometimes the tulle disappeared on the skinand sheer paneling has never looked more decorous or discreet On other pieces it was thicker almost like athletic mesh creating a sporty mien The second talking point was pink Im in my rose period Herrera said From a flirty day dress (real pleats not trompe loeil) in a delicate shade of blush to an embroidered shift in raspberry suede there was no shortage of the shade and it did a good job of warming up the somewhat clinical feel of the synthetic materials For those not predisposed to pink there were a few other frocks in black and white and a nice-looking vaguely New Look suit in midnight blue flocked velvet Herrera was eager to avoid prints because shes done them so often in the past Like we said resolutely modern-minded Still that rose-print slip dress was awfully pretty$$Alexis Martial and Adrien Caillaudaud took the ultra-gamine Carven girl on a deep-sea dive for their Spring 2016 collection exercising their ability to produce neat tailoring sporty details and the type of kicky youthful A-line silhouettes that consistently bring the ingenues running credit cards extended The story said Martial and Caillaudaud backstagewhile standing before an inspiration board posted with Corinne Days portraits of Kate Moss for The Face early female scuba divers and assorted oceanic creatureswas of a girl in search of a seaside adventure She ditches her boyfriend (but packs some of his shirts to wear with her minis) and learns to scuba dive Eventually as the looks lead into evening she goes back to the city only now shes wearing her souvenirs  And true to the narrative nautical touches on suiting and separates (eyelets as portholes) gave way to transparent logo tees paired with a Grey Gardensesque shirt-as-skirt (Because youre on the boat and you really dont care said Caillaudaud) and eventually a long and lean silhouette often centered around a narrow crepe pant anchored by a clunky sandal But while prints were derived from sea creatures (jellyfish octopuses striped puffer fish all covered in fluorescent spots and striations) and one stiff frocks frilled edges were reminiscent of undulating tentacles most of the clothesbarring at least one excellent knit which boasted dangling beaded fringelacked the movement inherent to the life aquatic favoring instead the rigid thickness of decidedly un-casual clothes Adventure after all is about freedomand even ingenues need some wiggle room$$For his Spring 2016 collection Cdric Charlier was driven to abstractionspecifically to the work of Victor Pasmore who is credited with pioneering abstract art in Britain in the first half of the 20th century Pasmore was a painter and an architect too but there was none of that kind of sculptural quality to Charliers designs which in most cases were worn away from the body hanging straight down from the shoulders or cinched at the waist by thick obi-style belts which also hung loose off the backs of some dresses trailing behind the models as they walked  Silhouette was clearly foremost in the designers mind I was really interested in this T shape Charlier explained backstage before the show tracing the trunk and shoulders of one of the model images on his run of show and it showed The shoulders were the strongest point on a majority of looks with skirts typically ending in a loose ruffle and trousers in a frayed hem The palette was predominantly neutral in shades of blush pink and peach occasionally dipping into hunter green and the fabrics were mostly natural fibersas Charlier said he wanted to stay with cotton and silk for as much of the collection as possible It was all designed for day from the boxy shirtdresses with plenty of hanger appeal to the military-style anoraks done in waxed cotton and cotton jacquard Most winning were the mixed-print patchwork dresses which felt hard and soft all at once with all of the grace of Pasmores own Roses in a Jaronly this version you can wear to your next garden party$$Its about taking her out of urban life and putting her feet on the sand Its where I long to be more and more said Phoebe Philo in her debrief about Cline as dozens of journalists jostled to shove their iPhones in her face But the background of Clineits conceptual tented setting its variety the storming briskness of her modelscannot be captured in a convenient old-school sound bite about color silhouette and theme Philo rebuilt Cline by trusting her instincts and by trusting that other women are tuned into the same wavelength And now shes getting more outspoken about it I am somebody who is interested in how clothes make us feel she said and in how we behave in different places I thought If you were traveling for a year what would you need to take with you Where were her model-avatars heading The space constructed by FOS a Danish installation artist suggested something between a festival hangout and an art biennial in a hot locale but the music was a mechanistic drumming that kept pace with the stream of girls marching swiftly and with intent shod in utilitarian ankle boots or almost-medieval woven-leather pointy flats   If anything has turned a corner at Cline since the last couple of shows its the feeling that an incipient conceptualism and eccentricity has been jettisoned Instead this was a grounded collection a sophisticates compendium giving the definitive word on wearing the 90s slip dress in pulled-together grown-up style on handling the 80s tendency with a curvy shoulder line and a Jean Paul Gaultier rib-knit waist on nodding to the milkmaid neckline with an abstracted trompe loeil corseting and on pants pants pants What with the English menswear tweedy checked suiting the wide cropped pair of trousers in extraordinarily high-shine black satin and then the olive green army parka and pants that swing out at the end Philo reminded all and sundry that this is the house that services women with the best cuts available Yet on the other hand Cline is also a dress source And here there was a full spectrum of those as well not just plunging lace-edged slips but practical workday survival looks in utititarian linen and then for evening or perhaps day-wafting on holiday long fluid jersey dresses with high-waisted bodices and chaste-medieval scooped necks A telling reaction to this collection was the instant straw poll going on among guests as they poured out of the show Asking each other what they liked best everyone had a different answer And thats the way it is today There is and should be no one look but a spectrum of equally valid looks for many of us to feel like ourselves in Phoebe Philos genius is that she holds the mirror up to that emotional reality Applause$$Does a vulnerable woman have to be weak Chris Gelinas posed that question today and with his Spring collection offered up the answer as he saw it certainly not Taking as his central motif a graphic spin on one of Irving Penns famous flowersa punchy version of a typically fragile thingGelinas toyed with different takes on the idea of controlled exposure His opening look a barely there white tank and hot pants came topped with a hardy coat in a menswear-inspired plaid Elsewhere languid dresses came with curving seams that buttoned (or unbuttoned) all the way up Gelinas noted that while his clientele of a certain age would wear them the traditional way his more directional young shopper could well opt to undo them throw on a pair of shorts and let the dresses sides fly free  The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist had some real hits on his hands with pieces like a printed blouse with slashed full sleeves (shown with another pair of hot pants) and his fabrications remain among the strongest of New York Citys young guns While impeccable textiles and techniques arent always fully appreciable on the runway Gelinass guests milled around post-show admiring the Italian blossom-print fils coup jacquard shorn and married to an underlayer of black organza and the dense all-over embroidery that gave a certain toughness to his flounced miniskirt The designer showed a similar skirt for Fall 2015 but still this collection felt a far cry from that seasons nicely austere homage to American workwear Here there was a certain albeit very modern primness you felt it in the buttoned-up shirts whittled cropped pant legs and circle skirts At times perhaps it was a bit more controlled than vulnerable you wanted to see Gelinass muse come just a bit more undone These clothes had a beautiful womanliness to them though Gelinass wholesale business is a relatively new one (he has a loyal base of private customers and now stockists that include Fivestory New York Shopbopcom and LAs Guerilla Atelier) You got the sense its only going to grow in the months to come$$Im a very curious person said Hussein Chalayan backstage Hes right about that in both senses For only an inquiring mindand a very particular attitudecould have formulated the fabulous coup de thtre at the heart of this mornings Chalayan presentation Upon entering the show space two models could be seen wearing white paper dresses with military detailing standing in some kind of glassless vitrine The audience checked them out then blanked them out They werent doing much just standing there The show proceeded As soon as the first bespoke cigar-holder pocket at the chest of an olive green military-style skirt-dress appeared it became apparent this was an extension of Chalayans most recent Cuban-themed menswear collection And indeed there were some looks from that outing sprinkled among the pliss skirts that were printed with abstracted pie charts from the CIA Factbook on Cuba the cute Plonk cartoon character Chalayan found in the British Library and transported to his muse nation and the neutral-toned dancer-and-trumpeter brocade For some reason the soundtrack was a medley of a woman moaning in suggestive ecstasy and the Knight Rider theme song unlikely bedfellows The clothes were precise and complicated and sometimes very beautiful Each model wore rope-tied shoes whose heel was an on-its-side cylinderone of these heels detached early in the show and rolled forlornly to a halt as its wearer walked on Then came the splash Those two paper-dress-wearing models tensed Two hidden showerheads above them suddenly gushed forth Andwhoathe paper dresses literally melted away as the water doused them revealing crystal-flashed palm-pattern party dresses beneath It was amazing to watch The models one of them shivering walked the runway and left a slick of water behind them Afterward the very curious Mr Chalayan explained the sleight of dress thusly That was to represent the transformation of a militant kind of situation [in Cuba] to a more playful one I liked the idea of using water Because of course Cuba theres a sea So I thought how could I fuse these ideas together And I liked the idea of a garment that could melt and reveal something else underneath And it was of course crystal embellished because our sponsor was Swarovski So we had these dancing palm trees and the crystals were their coconuts It was a real challenge to be honest A lot of back and forth Girls slipping as you saw and heels breaking but who cares I like taking risks Original curious and intelligent Chalayan is a designer to cherish$$See Chanel and fly As much as the foreign members of the audience might wish thats not quite the case since there are still 24 Paris hours to go till the Spring shows are over Still women of all nations were amused to check in ahead of time at the Chanel airport terminal Karl Lagerfeld installed in the Grand Palais It provided a funny enhanced-reality replica of a situation we all know only too well the one where we watch everyone else milling around busy on their ways with their rolling suitcases their tracksuits and contra-freeze in-flight comfort sweaters their practical flats for walking the endless corridors to baggage claim and the crucial sunglasses for the jet-lagged arrival Only of course all this is considerably upgraded Its the idea of how it should look quipped Lagerfeld It is strange to see Chanel taking over the flight controls the day after a dispute between Air France and its workers came to an ugly head over falling business and layoffs Instead here was Chanel putting the best and most globally appreciated face of France forward and laying out an array of products that will most certainly fly off the racks at duty-free and in all cities where the house has boutiques Chanel has been most careful to clock up its air miles in customer-care outreach in the past couple of years The destinations indicated on the Grand Palais departure boardSingapore Dubai Seoul Tokyoare all cities where Lagerfeld and co have taken the double-C traveling show to first-class customers And what will this well-traveled international clientele be taking onboard from this particular show Bits and pieces from all over the concourse no doubta Chanel range that runs from the witty and kitsch (Chanel hard-case wheelie carry-on bags Teva-type sandals with tweed straps and flashing runway-landing lights running around the soles) takes off in the ironic insider trophy (70s leisure jackets plane-patterned tricolor intarsia cashmere sweaters and a flash of Laura Ashleyesque puff-sleeved denim) and then lands amid sparkling splendor The twinkling herringbone jackets and shell tops paved in crystal and decorated with fat black ribbon bows are quintessentially timelessly Chanel nothing to do with noveltyyet also in their way an accessory rather than an outfit In the congested skies of fashion Captain Karl is one person who knows how to navigate Chanel in all the right directions$$The 1990s is one of Springs big stories but no one has put forward her interest in the decade more explicitly than Clare Waight Keller at Chlo On every seat there was a printed note This seasons collection is a tribute to girls named Kate Chlo Cecilia Corinne Rosemary Emma and Courtney who embody the liberty and the elegance of a perfectly mastered and excessively lived simplicity Backstage the designer explained she grew up alongside that motley crew of models photographers and superstar performers For Waight Keller they represent a freer time Theres such a fast pace to fashion now I think weve lost the innocence of the spirit of fashion the youthful optimism that it portrays And I think theres something quite joyful about fashion thats been missing  In keeping with that sentiment she imbued the new collection with a playful spirit quite literally in the case of the rave-girl tracksuit separates she started with Athleisure is something different for Chlo and it was most convincing when Waight Keller combined a split-hem track pant with a romantic off-the-shoulder shirt typical of the brand As the show progressed it took on more of those familiar Chlo tropesfestival dresses peasant tops lacy little bandeaux and miniskirtsbut never lost its 90s leanings The denim separates were oversize and frayed Overallsin trouser and dress formconjured images of raves gone by too There were even Hammer (as in MC) pants All of which will likely play exceedingly well with young women who missed out on them the first time around  Waight Keller had Georgina Grenville Cecilia Chancellor and Angela Lindvall representing the 90s in the front row but what a kick it wouldve been to see them on the runway in these clothes Youthful optimism is wasted on the young$$There were mountains of delphiniums shipped in to decorate the Dior tent and mountains of people clogging the Rue de Rivoli entrance jostling for a glimpse of Rihanna Inside though There was Raf Simons backstage talking about keeping things simple and quiet Its a calm one and very softaway from the overdone I didnt want to embellish So I was thinking about the South of Francerainbows and the simple things And theres a bit of Victoriana something of that film Picnic at Hanging Rock With a slight sexual undertone of darkness Simons can lay reasonable claim to have been the one to start both the current Victoriana-nightdress trend and the intergalactic astronaut trends that are running through so many collections this seasonhe proposed both themes in his Spring 2015 ready-to-wear show But part of the responsibility for helming a behemoth brand like Christian Dior is filling stores with daywear for women who like feminine things rather than conceptual clothes and this season he attended to servicing it  His solution was to pair scallop-edged handkerchief cotton dresses little shorts and bodices with black tailoring The jacketssoftened from the corseted New Look hourglassskimmed the body and broke into bands of micro pleats at the hem a masculine-feminine merge suggesting the techniques that went into the trains of Victorian and Edwardian dresses The sexual undertone Not so much in the clothes as at the necks which were bound with tight scarves and chokers each carrying a single jewel and dangling a metal tag some of which read 1947 the date of Diors revolutionary New Look collection In terms of fashion though there was nothing very disturbing or challenging in any of this Deliberately so In a season where many collections have apparently neglected to remember that there might be warm weather in 2016 Dior is one place where fresh summer options will be found$$The North African playground of Morocco is oft-mined territory for fashion designers Its exotic textiles and rich cultural landscape stole the heart of Yves Saint Laurent and Alber Elbaz paid homage to the ancient land (also his birthplace) for Lanvins sumptuous Fall 2015 show But fast-forward a generation or two to New York Citybased designer Christian Siriano whose Spring 2016 show mapped a fantasy road trip taking in Casablanca Marrakech Tangier and Fez through his glamorous West Coast lens It was about the dream of Morocco I researched traditional interiors and architecture including many different mosques said Siriano He stripped back the vibrant palette of the Berbers in favor of optic white blush and sandy-toned silks cut into his signature structured shifts and a slew of floaty tunics matched with pencil skirts or fluid palazzo pants Amid the flounce of handkerchief hems and cocktail dresses in body-con knit Siriano applied an intricate textural play of pom-poms fringing and a geometric tiled jacquard that reflected his inspiration with a somewhat heavy hand Later on he tipped the scales in his favor when translating those tropes into the more familiar territory of eveningwear where pleated goddess gowns and a frothy tulle pinafore injected a welcome lightness It is from those looks that Sirianos front row fixtures Christina Hendricks and Orange Is the New Black star Laura Prepon might choose their next red carpet moment a marabou-flecked ball skirt perhaps or one of the gowns encrusted in scalloped peach sequins Despite their couture touch even those showstoppers paled in comparison to four finale looks that emerged with satin trains in eye-watering pastel silksthose were the welcome color shock this collection needed from the get-go$$I wanted something very airy very light very easyand quite minimal as well said Christian Wijnants at his presentation today Well consider that job done But    hold on    presentation Wijnants has stepped off the runway He said this was a result of the opening of his first flagship store in Antwerp a project that has been dominating his time Hmm Hmmmmm Well whatever the reason the absence of a runway proved no greatly significant obstruction to the delivery of this collection Wijnants said he had been thinking about Brancusi and there was some correlation to that evident in the irregular lumpen-ness hinting at distorted symmetry in his fil coupe applications More broadly though this was an efficient but not especially uplifting compilation of contemporary fashion tropes The strongest pieces included a tightly fringed kicky jumpsuit and a blouse fronted with frayed panels of clothes that transformed the canvas pants obscured beneath them into the viable foundation of an evening look Fil coupe suiting printed with a tonal monkey relief motif frayed panel cotton viscose knit tees some linen-lined scuba-foam hot pants and fringing galore on denim-chambray separates were all fine and dandy It was interesting though how the transplantation of this collection from runway to showroom rather sucked the oomph out of it This collection was full of solidly tasteful left-field pieces but there was not a great deal to get properly excited about here$$Last season she discovered sex said Christopher Kane Now shes crazy in love Kanes work is always about who he is where he comes from and what hes experiencing at the time And some of the creative connections he makes are through language The word crazy is the one with the emotional double meaning which set him off this time Our life has been a bit of a car-crash recently he remarked in a preview at his studio He did not spell out why that is but he and his family have been dealing with the recent loss of their mother and of Christophers mentor in the past year or so Thus the imagery of car-wrecks fractured shapes jagged cutouts and spray-painting filtered into his dresses and tailoring Perhaps it was his raw state of mind that led him to look at the instinctive unfiltered nature of outsider art a train of thought that led him to apply naive hand-stitched motifs to sweaters and leather coats and to apply frayed white chiffon frills to collars and pockets Another sideways leap made Kane think about mental institutions and medical science hence the woman in the blue shirt banded with wipe-clean plastic cuffs and a strict skirt Like a nurse whos going to give you a lethal injection Belaboring explanations is never the way to understand Christopher Kane though Getting him is always a case of whether you appreciate his electric fusion of weirdness and chic There were jolts of that sort of current running through the detailsnarrow plastic restraint tags on black silk dresses worn as chokers and decorating bags a reprise of Kanes signature neon lace in even sicker combinations of orange yellow and lime and funny envelope clutches cut in the shape of cartoon explosions Fun odd and elegant by turns this was a show which covered a lot of bases No matter what life has been throwing at him it proved that Christopher Kane is a solid designer$$Ladies heres a dating tip Go out with guys like Christopher Raeburn This is an analysis based entirely on Raeburns design ethos but it doubles as a pretty good laundry list of things to look for in a man 1) Raeburn has integrity as demonstrated in his commitment to utilizing upcycled and locally sourced materials and vegetable dyes like the ones used in the silk floral prints in his latest collection 2) Raeburn is a true team player on the evidence of the two collaborations he unveiled this seasonchunky sandals made with Clarks and knits produced with the house Knyttan 3) Hes romantic yet practical Note the standout accessory at Raeburns show this afternoon a hand-tied jacquard fanny pack Nuff said Really though the main reason to go out with a guy like Christopher Raeburn is that Christopher Raeburn is as excited about the things a woman does as the way a woman looks Purely on the level of aesthetics this was by far Raeburns most compelling womenswear showhe finally got a firm handle on feminine cuts and codes But Raeburn arrived at that breakthrough courtesy of his theme an homage to intrepid female explorers that summoned both a pioneer spirit and a sense of authority For all the sheer diaphanousness of a dress in patchworked olive drab parachute silk for instance the look still communicated vigor and potency Seriously date a guy who understands that softness and strength are not opposing values Raeburn evinced that understanding again and again in these clothes There was a certain tenderness to his basket-weave fil coupes made from strips of old air-break parachute fabric and either overdyed black or left plain But Raeburn used the textile in silhouettes that were matter of fact like a wrapped tunic and long skirt or a pair of low-slung wide-leg trousers Elsewhere transparent materials or his vegetable-dyed floral print introduced that tender note Other looks had a harder more graphic edge in particular the printed gray jersey and olive drab cotton pieces but he muted the blunt effect by hewing to shapes that though tailored were relaxed Raeburn has suddenly become very good at mixing his tones and creating garments that feel multidimensional His clothes were distinctive but not defining A woman wearing them could feel utterly herself and confident about lighting out for new territory Date a guy like Christopher Raeburn Or you know what If youd rather feel free to go it alone$$The humble weed is finally getting its moment in the spotlight Inspired by their ability to survive in urban environments against all odds Rozae Nichols turned her Spring collection into what she called a celebration of the mightiness of these hard-to-kill plants and their knack for breaking their way through cracks in cement Nichols whose brand launched in 2011 quickly found success with her digital floral prints which have been stamped on a growing list of categories that now includes shoes and swimwear But this season the designer seemed to want to branch out in a new direction Her best pieceslike a color-blocked cami dress or topwerent printed at all but embellished with hand-stitched laser-cut flowers part of Nicholss aim to push her signature florals into the third dimension The palettesalmon pink with lavender dusty rose with brown navy with golden yellowlent everything a delightful jolie laide vibe Nichols has also been training her customer to seek solids from the label the cropped colorful flares will certainly further her efforts$$Co is a brand based in Los Angeles Until now though the collections that Co honchos Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern produced havent been particularly suggestive of the placetheres always been an idiomatically Californian sense of ease to Cos clothes but its been overshadowed by a tone of Old World soign (And sometimes a certain cloudy-weather moodiness too) This season however Kern and Danan took inspiration from their surroundings lightening up their collection both literally and tonally and tipping their hat to the local landscape with palm-frond motifs and fabrics that conjured a distant ocean view What Cos new materials lacked in weight they made up for in richness The lavish materials included a palm-patterned mesh jacquard a wave-textured 3-D-printed viscose and most gorgeous of all a white chiffon flecked with devor velvet A keyhole-collared maxi dress in the fabric was one of the collections understated standouts Elsewhere there were simple button-down blouses with high-drama collars tailored frocks with bouffant skirts handknit cotton sweaters and a bevy of A-line and Peter Pancollared looks that referenced high-end mod The big sellers though will be Cos expanded range of denim done in collaboration with Franois Girbaud As well as introducing new silhouettes in the raw Japanese denim currently flying out of stores Kern and Danan debuted a version of their best-selling flares in off-white cotton canvas Emboldened perhaps by the Girbaud collaborations success Co has embarked on two new ones The terrific hats in the lookbook were done in partnership with milliner Fil and the sunglasses are Co by Jacques Marie Mage Altogether the clothes and accessories made for a very Co take on LA Hollywood glam as reimagined by Truffaut or Fellini perhaps$$Stuart Vevers walks to work at Coach along the High Line every day lucky thing The aerial park with its grasses and fig trees and urban butterflies tracks across the west side of Manhattan as one of the most joyously human examples of industrial repurposing in our times The new Coach offices are under construction near the end of the High Line at 30th Street as it happens and it was adjacent to that location on a perfectly sunny September afternoon that the company invited the press buyers and celebrities to step along the old railway tracks and into a temporary grass-planted space to see the first big runway show Coach has staged for New York Fashion Week As it also happens 2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Coach So said Vevers it felt like a good moment to show we have confidence The values of Coach have always been purely American and pragmatic a company proud to fulfill everyday needs But in the 21st century Vevers is one of those designers who questions how and whether that democratic ideal in fashion is reaching young people at attainable prices and in ways that will excite them His answer was to think about a magpie girl who goes on road trips picking up Western things but also might steal from her grannys closet on the Upper East Side If so granny was a bit of a 70s bohemian because this girls dresses were all made from micro-floral multicolored patchworks though they were definitely a lot shorter than they were at Woodstock and with an easily relatable pull-on-and-go attitude about them Still Vevers is not someone who will go off on narrative raptures about fictional muses Refreshingly hes a down-to-earth product designer who is good at thinking about such things as what a functional cut-down cowboy boot should look like for a customers money ie comfortable with a lot of collaged fun thrown into the bargain I dont think Ive ever put a heel on the runway at Coach he said laughing I just want to make it feel light in spirit and bring some joy to it and maybe a sense of the American outdoors It worked Coach is of course a great American bag companyand there were plenty of respectfully traditional saddle-leather hobo shapes reprised in the showbut it also needs to convert a new generation to its faith And oddly on the High Line today it felt as if Stuart Vevers an Englishman abroad is the person who might be able to see exactly how to do that$$The cult of Comme is a complicated micro-society shadowed by layers of lines within Beneath apex-Commeand what a truly incredible collection Rei Kawakubo showed this weekthere is the Comme des Garons commercial collection that never sees the light of runway but that the buyers flock to postshow Boy the showroom was rammed today Below significantly below there is Comme Shirt (kinda my favorite in terms of buy-to-wear) Comme Girl and probably several others hidden away in the Comme-citadel on Place Vendme of which most people have probably never heard Comme des Commethis collectioninhabits a welcome sweet spot between haute Comme and Girl It is the go-to uniform for Comme acolytes These are the clothes of the disciples Todays collection contained an interesting mlange of the rustic and the historical shot through with the white-and-navy overtones of seifuku (old-school Japanese school uniform lifted from French sailor suits) that seem so ingrained in the Comme unconscious The cut-away angle beneath the two buttons on a nylon/polyester jacket (CdGCdG is a master of mustering richness in synthetics) spoke loudly of early19th century military tailoringlook at portraits of Lord Nelson The rough gently pleated linen shift and smock dresses whispered of a Thomas Hardy-ish bucolic vision of the tenant farmers wife There were even pantaloons worn over the usual Repetto uwabaki This was a carefully and poignantly rendered articulation of the ascetic aesthetic of Comme slow fashion for deep thinkers Dreamy$$Rei Kawakubo has cast a spell over her audience The fashion community strives to keep believing that fashion can touch deeper meanings in this time of often bewildering industrial change and she's the one people turn to for some kind of emotional stimulus that goes beyond the blunt service of commerce Once more this season she again blocked the expectation that she would offer anything recognizable as clothes Instead she mounted a monumental sculptural meditation on Blue Witches a coda further explained by her husband Adrian Joffe as Powerful women who are misunderstood but do good in the world Was she talking about herself Comme des Garons as a retail operation has grown against all odds as an independent multibrand chain which buys young designers whom Kawakubo personally approves and sells their work in branches in Tokyo New York and London They definitely regard her as a woman with magical transformative powers who they hold in awe In those stores meanwhile Kawakubos own conceptual collections reappear in simpler wearable forms right down to ranges of T-shirts which indicate her original runway styles in cool ways Whether or not that qualifies Kawakubo as a literal Witch it can safely be predicted that the ideas she put forth on her Spring runaway will make their way in far more accessible forms to her shops all over the word That surely gives her the right to go as experimental and extreme as she did this season$$All around Paris the Comptoir des Cotonniers ads featuring Charlotte Gainsbourg and her daughter Alice catch the eye without imposing upon it Fresh into her second season creative director Anne Valrie Hash said the Fall suiting and new Slash sneaker are outperforming expectations As for her Spring collection her enthusiasm radiated through the brands showroom First she presented an all-white grouping a tuxedo-style blazer and trousers and a slouchier pullover with rolled-cuff pants Next she made the case for military-inspired jackets paired with ingenue base layers Hash seemed especially excited to reveal Comptoirs partnership with J Brand (both are part of Fast Retailings roster) and the resulting denim range Unsurprisingly the sneakers will return this time in denim gray jersey and floral-printed leather She showed how small details such as knits with deep side slits make a big difference in how the clothes can be worn And once summer arrives a new cotton-viscose blend dubbed Ma Double Peau (My Second Skin) will solve the summer-weight sweater woes Dresseslong patchwork white lace with a drawstring waist a flimsy embroidered and printed slipmarked the seasons apogee Yet when Hash singled out the well-proportioned overcoats (neither too boxy nor too slim) and the hickory stripe slacks noting that they could have been worn 10 years ago and could likely be worn 10 years from now she revealed how smoothly shes integrated the Comptoir spirit with her own Overall she seemed well aware that maintaining momentum is as simple as keeping things simple$$Seventies 80s 90s Any which way you cut it fashion is in the midst of a vintage moment Whats a born and bred minimalist to do Costume National designer Ennio Capasa to his credit isnt changing his tune Hes been around too long for that a fact he likes to emphasize on his mood board labeling images from his past with their season and year For Spring 2016 he doubled down on the tailoring hes long been associated with and streamlined his color palette Backstage he said he focused on fabric development to create sensuality Glitter pinstripes polka-dot fil coupe and suede laser-cut to look like lace made appearances A minidress as silvery as tinsel was gathered at one shoulder with a silk ribbon Still you couldnt help but feel Capasa preferred the simplicity of basic black or white which he used more than anything else here perhaps because it put nothing extraneous in the way of his tailoring This season his suiting had a somewhat softer more feminine sensibility than it has in the past Ruffles cascaded down the front of a vest and metal rings connected the front and back panels on jackets leaving a suggestive slice of shoulder exposed Minor developments A single red pantsuit worn with a sheer red turtleneck underneath made a lasting impression but otherwise this collection couldve used more spark$$Does the world need another heritage brand Probably not Do women outside of France have any special feeling for Courrges Unlikely But any doubts about Sbastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillants efforts to revive Andr Courrgess space-age label were quickly dispelled by their show this morning The LVMH Prize finalists who put their fledgling line Coperni Femme on hold to focus on this endeavor made a clever debut Their trick was to get down to basics As the pair said when they came out onstage to introduce the collectiona charming performance that was a novelty in and of itselfthe show had no total looks Instead there were iconic Courrges items tweaked for 2016 shoppers15 in all and each one available in a range of 15 different materials That kind of variety will be a boon to retailers which tend to want items unique to their stores And it was refreshing to see young designers focused so clearly on commerce especially in a season when others have been creatively flummoxed by new responsibilities at the historic brands theyve inherited  The show felt a bit like Courrges 101 what with the steady progression from the houses familiar cropped jacket in a crinkly patent to miniskirts A-line shifts and cropped pants in such materials as suede techno knits and patchworked leather The foundation for every piece was a white ribbed knit bodysuit that Meyer and Vaillant could spin out in a dozen directions next season if they choose to  Courrgess owners Jacques Bungert and Frdric Torloting planned this launch just about perfectly The late 60s and early 70s have been trending on the runways since Nicolas Ghesquire landed at Louis Vuitton Julien Dossena has done a bang-up job of breathing new life into Paco Rabanne whose work shares similarities with that of Courrges Timing counts The faster this foursome can get these pieces in shops and online the better$$Spring found Jade Lai in conversation with Le Corbusier The Creatures of Comfort designer was looking at the storied mid-century architect and his prolific elemental legacy After a stay at his Brutalist Marseille masterwork the Radiant City it seems the pair struck up a natural repartee Lais collection opened with a grouping of graphic prints in jolie laide color combos The first look was a shirtdress in blocky black red white and pale yellow It was bold to be sure Elsewhere that mood manifested itself even more vividly as with a sheeny cherry-red tank dress layered under knit shorts in an equally punchy shade of the same color Among other standouts were the closing pair of looks liquid-looking cupro pieces rawly appliqud with designs inspired by Le Corbusiers drawings The architect would no doubt have approved of Lais take on off-shouldernot some festival-ready style gauzy and hanging from the collarbone but a graphic straight-across chicly seductive version Styled beneath a knit slip dress it felt in step with the runways recent mood What was particularly notable about these pieces though was their sophisticated brand of commercial appealscarcely anything looked daunting to style Denim was particularly strong here Lai had expanded her explorations with the stuff since Resort and she may well have the ultimate high-rise flare on her hands Whats more elemental than dreamy blue jeans$$When does something thats come and gone come back into fashion Creatures of the Winds Christopher Peters asked backstage before the labels Spring 2016 show and during a moment when fashion-conscious girls everywhere reach into their closets to pull out everything from 20s tea dresses to orange-tab-bearing Levi's 501s and sleek contemporary suiting its certainly a worthy question For Peters and design partner Shane Gabier it became a way to create a pastiche of all of their favorite things in their latest collection from cropped motorcycle jackets with seams co-opted from 40s corsetry to bias-cut skirts 30s slip dresses and glam rockinspired denim As it processed by on the runway it had the not-entirely-unappealing feeling of a yard sale attended by punky young femmes with bouffant hairdos and fishnet tights This being Creatures of the Wind the winsome 70s were never far behind whether spotted in the densely floral-embroidered miniskirts and crocheted vests or the chunky-heeled hand-painted snakeskin slingbacks that alternated mostly with slip-on sneakers designed in tandem with APL And while theres certainly something to be said for culling all the best bits from the current trendsfrom a silky wallpaper-patterned cotton jacquard and a wispy silk-cut floral dvor slip of a frock to trouser legs and tunic hems replete with ring-pull zips for ones own adjustmentsthe most winning looks felt truest to Creatures of the Winds own sense of charm cheeky trim knits paired with sloping skirts and an army jacket emblazoned with a hammered silver floral motif the type of treasure that can become both utterly trend-resistant and just the ticket for weathering spring The designers choice to begin and end the show with a suitthe first in block-print linen the last in black cotton sateen worn with a flowing ivory and metallic-striped pleated dress and trousers that ended mid-calf in a thick wide cuffproved a happy accident Its where we are said Peters pointing at the run of show and thats where were going$$As nineties fashion references go hip-hop gets short shrift Grunge keeps coming back so do nods to original Helmut Lang But the hip-hop aesthetic which had such a resounding impact on mainstream style is reinterpreted comparatively rarely on luxury fashion runways Thats changingsome of the kids who grew up on hip-hop are fully formed designers nowbut still it was striking to see Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochss homage to the look at their show today Ochs and Cushnie came at hip-hop via the work of painter Kehinde Wiley famed for his Baroque-style portraits of black men clad in the everyday garb they wear on the street Wiley made for an interesting bridge inasmuch as the reference to his work allowed the designers to play with tropes for which they clearly have a great deal of affectionnote the baggy pants and bandanas pleasewhile simultaneously giving their collection a sense of hauteur This was relative to previous Cushnie et Ochs outings a very ladylike collection That tone was evident especially in the color palette which erred toward Easter-egg pastels but it was also reflected in the number of rather demure silhouettes There was skin to be surebest seen from the back in the apron-style openings of certain tops and dressesbut the duos signature pencil dresses were not so much body-con this season as classically form-fit There were a lot of feminine grace notes here as well like the little flutter of a ruffle edging one yellow frock or a scarf collar on another dress in seafoam green Other elements such as black leather and bright gold buttons or zips introduced a harder edge Cushnie and Ochs were onto something interesting using a reference typically perceived as tough to soften up their signature look and in so doing elevating it a great deal They should make a habit of thinking that way$$Custo Dalmau called his Spring collection Slow which appeared to be a bit of a misnomer at first because the head-on collision of prints colors and textures felt more like a frenzy Actually the collections name is an homage to slow cooking of all things which the show notes defined as a culinary movement that rejects the standardization of taste Dalmau wanted to go against the current he said defying the pull of fast fashion and deliberately designing pieces that would require painstaking and time-consuming work One open-work vest was assembled like a puzzle from different pieces of fabric that had been cut into geometrical shapes Backstage one could admire the impressive handiwork but on the runway it was hard to notice because between the contrasting car-wash-pleat skirts color-saturated dresses layered over slinky striped flares and embroidered patchwork contraptions there was simply too much going on The collection would have benefited if Dalmau had subtracted a few ingredients that way we could have savored the unique taste of each piece$$Perennially sunny Cynthia Rowley was feeling especially so today in the airy white-walled expanse of her new West Village headquarters for intense planning on multiple fronts had come to fruition The surf-inspired video showcasing her Spring collection was in the can as they say her Rowley Fitness lineloaded with wetsuitshad arrived her new furniture line was on the way and a home fragrance was in the works But most painstaking of all had been the HQ itself Bought a year ago and exhaustively renovated (It looked like the water-logged insides of the Titanic quipped the designer) it was also finished or very nearly so down to the Instagram-friendly gold door painted on the outside The space will double as a kind of community center she said with yoga classes and everything But if Rowley seemed exhausted (she didnt) she was only feigning it She is forever looking and moving forward Her Spring collection exemplified this willful cheer with its splashes of sequins in floral patterns bursts of metallic tinsel trim tufts of fluttery shredded chiffon comfy knits bold twill appliqus and studs the size of saucers A colorful 60s-style worldliness prevailed Shapes were roomy and breezy think caftans jumpsuits A-lines and mini kimonos all sashed liberally Accessories too were shiny and happy in particular cat-eye sunglasses and a large beaded necklace that looked straight out of a Frida Kahlo self-portrait Now there was a woman with cheerful resilience  Rowley is an avid surfer as are her daughters hence the wave-riding theme of the video which will debut tonight in an immersive installation that thanks to drone technology all but plops the viewer beachside It was touch-and-go though As a storm moved in the day of the shoot Rowley sprang into action and got the cast and crew out to Montauk earlier than planneda triumph of logistical will to be sure What can I say she chirped Im a pathological optimist$$Sure Daks was born in London shows in London and maintains a retail home on Jermyn Streetthe greatest old-school menswear thoroughfare in the world Those British roots though have become a mere backstory for a house that thrives in Asia and most especially in Japan where its owners are based Today the brands creative director Filippo Scuffi delivered an assured portfolio of conservatively au courant womenswear that avoided the painful Anglophile bombast that has marked some of Dakss most recent shows The catwalk was plastered in marble-patterned paper and lined with chrome-effect cladding as if to resemble the Art Deco foyer of some grand 1920s hotel Along it unfolded a collection that played with some tropes of that time There were flapperish chiffon dresses marble-print pants and a pleasant recurring diamond relief Scuffi had sourced from a bolt of wallpaper printed in 1925 Yet this lineup roamed confidently beyond one particular theme There were some deftly handled plays on trad gents fabrics rebooted as feminine masculine shirting detailing emphasized on silk blouses and brogues that were transformed into double-strap high heels Rust the key color in Dakss historic check translated nicely into a slouchy suede patch-pocket skirt a shirtdress and scrunchily tactile bombers A pleat-heavy riff on chiffon dresses and blouses printed with iterations of that wallpaper pattern in teal and purple were well-executed takes on the Royal Tenenbaums-influenced Pucci/Gucci/Prada reappropriation of soft 70s kookiness Most meh-heavy was a climactic evening section whose various grand gestures of volume or length seemed out of sync at least to this eye Backstage Scuffi pointed out that one recurring printa washed-out botanical X-rayhad been a special request from Asia And when a designer is thinking so hard about one particular market it seems churlish to complain that his collection isnt perfect for another$$The plaintive refrain that rings through Milan every Fashion Week goes thus Where are all the young designers Who's got a different voice So although he's a transfer from Paris the arrival of Damir Doma is something for locals to relish He's a jolt of beard-scratchy thoughtfulness in a town whose fashion business is gripped by the sleek a bit of spiritual underground to offset all the commercial overground Doma held his first Italian womenswear show in two adjacent garages behind Via Torino which gave it that most blessed of elements outdoor space On a rough-and-ready catwalk of chipped concrete the designer showed some comely new variations on his severe and monastic metier Crisp papery cottonin all-white checks or darkened navy strafed by stripeswas melded into restrainedly asymmetrical shapes given depth by fold and knot A loose micro-check overcoat was satisfyingly gathered by a looped closure The burnt-out opaque jumpsuits were a touch iffyhad the unreconstructed testosterone that courses through Milan dosed DDbut the same fabric incorporated into patched degrad black trousers worked well A fil coupe of distressed abstract shapes was deeply Doma palely interesting austere moody It suits this designer to be close to the production of his clothes and it suits this city to host him$$Shallow castellations of ruffle encircled floating corsets apparently boned by silver zippers that were the recurring chorus of this collection Armor-like of aspect and surely ideal for the encouragement of positive posture these topped the skinny pants and fluting skirts corralled by David Koma into what he said was a loose meditation on contemporary dance Folded strips of tulle wound tight around the body on fitted monochrome dresses or hung slacker on a dress of barely pink neoprene-lined napa with unzippable sections in its organza-lined skirt Swarovski gridding had the tough ornateness of a samurai breastplate on closing looks that reasserted the ruffle-topped corsetry A sheer skirt angled away from a matte black leather sports bra to make an incongruously funereal Empire-line dress Every detail whether languid ruffles a mushrooming gather or a remixed neckline appeared as intensely wrought and thought out as the most grueling dance routine And it is this relish that lends Komas work such a powerful signature$$Is novelty always necessary There are only subtle changes to be found between David Michaels collections but thanks to the near-perfection of his louche tailoring manythis reporter includedare all too happy to see him staying his chosen course of badass basics The fine finishing softly rakish fabrics and general minutiae may be lost in the context of a lookbook but are impressed upon you straight away on seeing Michaels wares in person (find them for example at Totokaelos massive new Soho digs where they hang alongside the likes of Haider Ackermann) According to Michael's origin story his grasp of patternmaking and how clothes hang came to him in a dream and indeed that innateness seems to translate into the ease of every garment from staples like slouchy pull-on pants and menswear-inspired toppers to more out-and-out sensual pieces like Springs hyper-languid jumpsuit Michael infused his signature shapes with a little witchy glamour too thanks to a glossy black jacket that gave major shades of The Hunger$$One imagines that Josep Fonts mind might be a lovely place to spend some time Theres an anachronistic quality to the designers brand of demi-couture as he has established it in his three years at the Spanish heritage house Delpozo His romanticism and unreservedly fairy-tale brand of femininity hearken back to another time and the designer has a love of dressing women thats palpable  For Spring Fonts women were those of Federico Garca Lorcas Gypsy Ballads and Emilie Flge muse to Gustav Klimt and in fact a fashion designer herself who envisioned proto-bohemian styles far ahead of her time Many a creative director has name-checked Flge in the past but rather than appearing merely as a vessel for Klimts famous aesthetic here Font found a grounding force in Flges love of folklore and the similarly earthy qualities to be found in Lorcas famous book Font whose work so often has an almost synthetically confectionary tenor to it incorporated those craftier elements into his vernacular in rich and compelling ways Take a stunning hand-crocheted long raffia vest or that same material brought to life in a massive icy blue belted wrap Pieces like that served as textural welcome foils to Fonts most purely extravagant looks If otherworldly volumes are a signature of his tenure with Delpozo thus far then the larger-than-life shirtdress in a metallic palm jacquard with tiers of generous ruffles or a sheer pannier-like miniskirt surely pushed even Fonts own boundaries (the fabric of the former came to life beautifully and more quietly as a fringed wrap over white trousers) A grouping of polka-dotted pieces early on and a long rounded skirt in graphic orange and blue scrollwork could surely have been cut from the collection since their sharpness felt so at odds with the ethereal ideas Font proposed elsewhere A blue and pink moire frock served as an especially vivid testament to Delpozo fantasia at its best and contrasted nicely with the houses first move into purses a chicly boxy doctors bag$$For decades Dennis Basso has enjoyed a loyal customer base of great dames and society women But recently the designer has been refocusing his collections to entice a new clientele The whole look this year it appeals to a younger woman said Basso backstage Its very youthful and vibrant and its all about the cities south of the borderCaracas Acapulco Rio But it was a subtle modern Latin flavor Basso was after The designer was thinking of Selena Gomez (whose song Good For You played on the runway) and Sofa Vergara This is for the hip international woman said Basso That translated to sultry playful ensembles that sizzled in marigold black and a vivid abstract tropical print which looked particularly fresh on a peplum top and shorts combination not unlike something Gomez would wear on the red carpet In fact the print was strong enough that it didnt need the embellishments that Basso adorned it with elsewhere Lace-up necklines and crop tops that wrapped at the waist injected a dose of sex appeal to the designers signature glam dresses and evening separates as did his take on Spanish lace on body-hugging dresses I think no matter who she is every woman wants to have that sex appeal said the designer  Basso was mindful not to stray too far from his core customer Evening coats boleros and black-tie-appropriate gowns were all present A gorgeous caramel croc bolero styled with a saucy lace camisole and high-waisted briefs was a standout It was the kind of investment piece one could imagine Bassos longtime customer purchasingonly to have it promptly co-opted by her daughter$$If Derek Lam 10 Crosby VP of design Liz Giardina is endorsing fringe pom-poms and eyelet this spring maybe minimalism really is on its way out The contemporary label tends to be a bit more eclectic than the tony Derek Lam main line but the surplus of texture and trim in this new collection still felt like a bit of a departure Giardina started with Andalusiabull-fighting clothes Moorish architecture saturated colorand made it palatable for her city-dwelling customer The Spanish reference was literal in the case of an embellished matador jacket less so in the clingy ribbed knits with ruffled edges but all of it was right-now wearable and in keeping with fashions artsy far-flung mood Clever twists on classic pieces are the center of the 10 Crosby brand See the ankle-length LBD with tiered ruffles the crisp shirtdress with hidden suspenders or the patchworked floral slip with dense eyelet trim A simple knit  dress in vibrant stripes and a ropey texture also managed to be special yet wearable Thats the sort of piece that will draw women to the rackeven those who wouldnt normally reach for a leather lace-up jumpsuit only to slip it on and instantly realize its endless styling potential Of course shoppers who are still hesitant to embrace the picador look should take note of the new accessories raffia wedges a patchwork hobo or a fringed bucket bag would add just a hint of flair to any outfit$$What Happened Miss Simone the Netflix doc about Nina Simones rich but up-and-down life was a starting point for Derek Lam this season Simone is a classic Lam muse American independent but not afraid to show her feminine side and fond of both caftans and the occasional pantsuit  Spring found Lam working the artier more bohemian side of his typical sportswear story One or two of his treasured trenches made their way down the runway lapel-free buttonless and as unfussy as usual And he did a new take on sailor pants another signature Elsewhere though Lam tried out just-this-side-of-eccentric ideas like cutouts at the hips of a skirt strung together with sneaker laces or circular swags of fringe placed here and there on a sleeveless sheath Those looked familiar from other recent runways and they distracted from simpler stronger pieces like intarsia knit dresses slips inset with lace that drifted softly away from the body and a chic sweater whose big quirk was its bell sleeves The show ended on a high note with siren-y gowns that Lam suspended from the neck halter-style to expose a sexy bit of shoulder$$Devon Halfnight LeFlufy cited nostalgia as the driving force behind his Spring collection a nod to the youth subcultures and style tribes of his adopted home Belgium (hes Canadian by birth) Showing mostly mens his strength with a sprinkling of womens the designer spoke of rave symbolism coded dance the frisson of youth meta-awareness found footage and the regrettable unoriginality of the Internet era A documentary-style approach as in a rave-scene print on intentionally oversized overcoats felt bold and novel Also suiting the theme of idealism were LeFlufys fabrics of choice poplin faux leather and a viscose rayon he developed LeFlufy earned his BA and MA at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts a premier fashion college associated with the Antwerp Six Excellent provenance to be sure and hes clearly benefitting from its legacy of wild imaginations chiefly that of Walter Van Beirendonck a pioneer of menswear with whom he trained LeFlufys ideas are at once conceptual and energetic not an easy feat to pull off nor was getting on the short list for this years LVMH Prize Itll be interesting to see where with some tightening he takes the label$$In the wake of the 40th anniversary of her iconic wrap dress Diane von Furstenberg seems keen to keep riffing on her origin story She called her show Fortvna after the Roman goddess of luck and the subject of the first painting Von Furstenberg ever bought She redefines beauty and paints her own destiny the program notes read Fortvnas curriculum vitae sounds a bit like DVFs own The models for their part wore their hair in waves with a fresh bloom tucked behind one ear the way Von Furstenberg did in her younger days Self-promotion is smart businessthe entrepreneurial Von Furstenberg would be the first to tell you that And more often than not this walk down memory lane paid off Perhaps nobody wouldve missed the metallic lam suede if it had stayed in the archives and the butterfly embroidery that she lifted from the painting erred a touch on the sweet side by the time the third dress emerged in that motif But the charm of the patchworked floral-print dresses in short and long varieties compensated Lily Aldridges plunge-front halter number would stop New York City traffic A shirtwaist style and a long dress crisscrossed below the bust by a skinny belt were more demure but still fetching  There were a few brief nods to the 2010s in the form of olive green leather separates and a single pair of work pants but Von Furstenbergs heart was in her heritage this season Nearly four decades after Studio 54 the one-shoulder dress hasnt aged a day It practically radiated here in multiple layers of saffron and pink chiffon$$According to Andreas Melbostad the starting point for this seasons Diesel Black Gold collection was the image of a girl wearing her boyfriends button-down shirt as a dress Thats one of those images that recur frequently in fashion and whether the trope comes off shopworn or as a durable idea that can continually be renewed depends entirely on the inventiveness of its reinterpretation Melbostads tack was to take scarf-like squares of cotton shirting-like fabric and pattern them intoslipdressesand skirts with handkerchief hems The look was repeated in white-and-black geometric broderie anglaise and with studs and in leather and most appealingly in blue-striped cotton broadcloth that quoted directly from the original inspiration The pieces each had a kicky charm but Melbostad hammered the look home a few too many times which dulled the collections impact Of course Melbostad hadnt forsworn the Diesel Black Gold staplesbiker jackets and denim The brands biker signature was worked into buckle details and sharp-looking dungarees and leather overall dresses There were also relatively straight-up biker jackets emblazoned with hardware The jeans meanwhile came off best here in versions dark mannish and low-slung but the Diesel Black Gold girl will also like the pairs done in lace or lace-textured white denim Theyll look pretty sexy matched with her boyfriends button-down shirt$$When hes applying himself to the craft of his clothes Dion Lee is the most rigorous of designers Hes a brilliant technician But the curious thing about Lee as his show this morning underscored is that he often seems incapable of applying the same degree of rigor to his collections overall as he does to their component parts This is hardly a problem unique to Lee but its particularly striking in his case because both his sense of discipline and the scope of his talents are plain to see Lees latest collection was a strong one but it needed an edit The best individual looks in the showthe black-and-navy scuba dresses with perforated flounceswere the ones that interfered most with the story Lee was trying to tell this season And that was an interesting story The collections nubby suedes bias-cut linen gauze and hues of rust and sand all expressed Lees ambition to introduce an earthy tone to his clothes while the loose-limbed silhouettes throughout the collection and an emphasis on patterns with relaxed wraps or folds asserted a soft sensuality Touch was key here and was manifested on both conceptual and literal levels in Lees looped and fringed looks in black-and-white triple-ply jersey The weave he explained after the show was inspired by the structure of skin And the textile that resultedLees main technical innovation herehad a compelling muscularity You could intuit the hand that had worked those jersey loops All of which is to say when Lee was on today he was very on And he was more on than off Alongside the scuba dresses however there were a clutch of filler looks that should have stayed with the sales team in the showroomto wit the suede biker jacket and slashed miniskirt or the anodyne dress of cobweb lace Dion Lee is Mr Focus when it comes to the micro If he ever figures out how to direct that focus to the macro there will be no stopping him$$When Donna Karan debuted DKNY in 1989 she specifically declined to categorize the looks she produced as fashion Fashion has seasons It changes over time What DKNY was about Karan told reporters was clothes In other words durable staple pieces that suited the on-the-go lifestyle of the brands target clientele DKNY launched casual and took on a more formal tone as time went on the brands most iconic look perhaps is the early-90s-era pinstriped power suit That was the primary point of reference for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne the popular pair behind the brand Public School as they took the DKNY reins To focus on the pinstriped suit was a canny choice on their part Where they faltered though was on emphasizing fashion over clothes Times have changed since DKNY first came on the scene Chow and Osborne are perfectly aware of that and their riff on the power suit included exactly zero actual power suits Rather what they offered to the present-day DKNY woman was a handful of broad-shouldered wide-lapel pinstripe blazers and a dazzling variety of de- and reconstructed power suit looksto wit a sarong-style pinstriped skirt a pinstriped tunic dress with an attached cotton skirt with shirttail hems and broken pinstripe silk prints There were sheer windowpane-striped fabrics worn layered and vertically ribbed knits that extended the pinstripe theme as well as shirtdresses and papery white tailored pieces that toyed with other key elements of the power suit look Some of these adaptations came off better than othersmenswear experts that they are Chow and Osborne cut a very mean blazer and their layered tank dresses with shirttail hems and sheer T-shirt dresses with knit underpinnings successfully updated the relaxed attitude of the original DKNY for a modern audience The curious thing about this collection was that it simultaneously betrayed Chow and Osbornes deep respect for the aesthetic codes of the house theyve taken over and their reluctance to embrace what those codes once meant One of the ways times have changed since 1989 is that DKNY is a giant brand now and so to some degree commercial imperatives may be at work Staple pieces dont have much novelty factor on the sales floor But it would have been nice to feel that Chow and Osborne had thought a little harder about the lifestyle today of the DKNY woman and what kinds of essentials she might need To their credit Chow and Osborne approached this show with a healthy dose of humility As they explained backstage the missing piece motif witnessed in the broken pinstripe prints and the pleated half-skirts among other looks was meant to express their sense that theyre still learning about the DKNY woman Shes coming together they said But shes not all there yet$$Stefano Gabbana was sitting amid a sea of accessoriesvelvet slippers with turned-up toes earrings in the shape of lemons and oranges crocheted raffia bags wooden clogs with rose-painted enameled soles and gigantic sunglasses decorated with flowers and crystalsin the Dolce & Gabbana studio before their show Meanwhile Domenico Dolce was coaxing laughs from a model as he fitted her into a black lace bra and skirt and proceeded to demonstrate how he wanted her to first sashay the runway then stop to take a selfie You see exclaimed Gabbana We dont believe in fashion for trends any more We want to show emotion Just enjoy  Their inspiration boards were pasted with printouts of vintage posters advertising the attractions of Capri Venice Rome and Florence movie stills of Italian stars and pictures of all kinds of handmade homemade souvenir embroideries This summer the designers have moved on from exploring Sicilian history to seeing Italys glories through the eyes of the foreign tourists who began to flood into the country after World War II There visitors found little shops selling embroidered circle skirts and sundresses printed scarves sandals straw hatsthings that Italian women had been making at home to cheer themselves up in times of austerity This is where the first boutiques came from explained Gabbana We think it was the beginning of Italian fashion And it was because foreigners saw it and liked it Sometimes we Italians dont appreciate all the things we have here Stepping back a bit to view the D&G show through the prism of the season it seems that Italian style and culturethe flamboyant sensual colorful sides of itare being appreciated again Alessandro Michele is on the same sort of track at Gucci and at Valentino theres a deep exploration of the glories of Rome In fact Dolce & Gabbana were actually on the scene first and have succeeded in grabbing girls and women from all around their world with their seasonal travelogues If that means ditching the anxieties of fashion and just going for clothes that suit and make you happy So be it say Dolce & Gabbana$$Dondup creative director Manuela Mariotti was looking at a more feminine romantic direction for Spring she tapped with gusto into the current feeling for all things bohemian in a collection that referenced poetry rock n roll Shakespeare and Glastonbury Part indie music goddess part Ophelia fragile beauty the Dondup girl was ready for her close-up swathed in fluid billowy dresses with frills galore and a touch of folklore Prints were digitally reworked from Indian motifs or suzani tapestries giving a vibrant feel to elongated lines in bright hues that popped up from a black background The mandatory 70s-style references were also on display high-waisted tunics bell sleeves wispy fabrics troubadour-ruffled blouses flared cropped pants It all made for a cohesive lineup with a graceful yet concise feel where denim was not at the core but more of an accent presented sparingly and in relaxed shapes It often happens when you design a collection that you get carried away working on an idea that then brings you in a completely different direction said Mariotti of a process that started with a futuristic vision and then morphed into a celebration of a free feminine spirit Empowering women and enabling them to express creativity is a theme very dear to the designer who despite the Ladies of the Canyon hippie vibe abundantly displayed in the collection still loves a good tough rock n roll gig and a well-fitted sexy pair of denim to dance the night away$$There comes a point in the season when the brain starts joining up the dots between collections or in the case before us here the trail of tarnished sequins Something in the detail of what Dries Van Noten did todayarranging gold copper carnation and pale blue paillettes in stylized winglike patternsalso resonated across the Atlantic with similar flashes of decoration by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte A sense of the faded glamour of old-time movie stars (or perhaps just the fusty remains of Old Hollywood costume departments) is seeping into the edges of several shows At Dries Van Noten it looked great glimmering on the bodices of long printed 1930s midi dresses or decorating white shirts and placed on the shoulders of sweaters A latter-day Katharine Hepburn would do them justice Whether there are or arent some parallels between 30s and 40s escapism from World War II and our need to gaze in the opposite direction from todays conflicts Van Noten didnt overtly draw attention to them in his notes Still there was the background of the show to contend with not the gilded grandeur of the Htel de Ville this time but a derelict industrial warehouse with rusting girders accessed through a crumbling concrete loading bay choked with weeds Not that there was anything melancholy or down-at-the-heels about the collection itself Essentially it was a steady continuation of Van Notens love of rich traditional fabrics like jacquards brocade and shot silk used this season in intriguing clashes of purple yellow ocher kingfisher blue and watermelon The addition of tattoo-like patterns on gloves socks and turtlenecks seemed to refer the eye to the Asian and tribal threads that run through the histories of such materials There will be plenty more of the Van Notens customers favorite pantsuits coats blouses and skirts next seasonif not very much to wear on a sunny summer weekend or holiday$$Dean and Dan Catens new collection for women picked up where their Spring 16 show for men left off at the beach Waves splashed on the backdrop of the otherwise stark set and out strutted Mariacarla Boscono in a cutout maillot and hip-slung boy pants a tangle of colorful climbing ropes harnessing her torso This hasnt been a big week for bathing suits but the Catens gave us several different varieties from sporty one-pieces to slinky little bikinis strung up with crystals Sexy has more or less gone out of fashion in Milan but not chez Dsquared2 Aside from those boyish trousers and a couple of pairs of high-waisted tie-dyed jeans the look here was seriously leggy Pleated chiffon maxi skirts split open in the front and otherwise it was all minis Leather bandage dresses Knit tube dresses worn two at a time And best of all clingy scuba dresses with antecedents in Nicolas Ghesquireera Balenciaga that combined tropical prints with bold swipes of color and three-dimensional embroideries This collection showcased the Catenss strengths sexy athletic silhouettes special denim their insatiable eye for color It also exposed a weakness their too-strappy overly high platform shoes Were not asking for Birkenstocks even though real-life surfers do have a predilection for those old-school cork-soled sandals just something slightly more down-to-earth in which the models could really move$$Duro Olowu has a talent for picking muses His latest is the artist Amrita Sher-Gil the Frida Kahlo of India as Olowu described her who managed to establish both an impressive body of work and an equally impressive reputation as a freethinking sexual experimenter before she died suddenly at the age of 28 Olowus silhouettes this season were a touch suggestive of those of India in the last days of the Rajthose late 30s bias cuts broad lapels and built-up shoulders fit neatly into his idiombut mainly it was Sher-Gils spirit that he drew on for his new collection He conjured her via a mix of boldness and ultra-femininity The boldness came through in the prints the best of which was a dot-and-stripe on silk that Olowu confessed hed doodled while on the telephone (Never throw anything away is the moral of that story) There was also a painterly yet graphic wild orchid print which Olowu executed with his typically canny sense of color Olowus clothes always have a feminine flaireven his tailored pieces boast a certain voluptuousness He doubled down on that here showing lots of looks that featured flounces and ruffles A long ruffle-hemmed camisole worn with a matching likewise ruffled long skirt for a tiered effect made for one of the collections standout looks Another was a black dress open in the back and ruffled down each side Olowu doesnt usually mess around with neutrals but this frocks all-black color (or lack thereof) only showcased the grace of its cut There was a similarly appealing sense of frankness to the cotton pieces in cobalt and khaki As noted Sher-Gil died young Perhaps that accounts for the fact this collection seemed an unusually youthful one for Olowu It was hard to put a finger on where that tone came from exactlythese clothes werent a far cry from those Olowu has created in the past Maybe it was the extra skin on display about the back and shoulders maybe it was the way these pieces even down to the gowns exuded an air of thrown-on informality Whatever it was the youthful kick added to the appeal of Olowus familiar aesthetic without diminishing its friendliness to women of all ages styles and shapes$$Perhaps the easiest way to explain Each x Other is to think of it as Fashion x Statement Designers Jenny Mannerheim and Ilan Delouis once again turned out attitude-enhancing clothes conducive to art parties (no coincidence the show took place at Emmanuel Perrotins spare gallery in the Marais) Then they recruited ongoing collaborator poet-artist Robert Montgomery as well as editor Jefferson Hack to anchor the collection in idiosyncratic aphorisms You sleep on the feathers of birds and their flights fill your dreams from the former Hack the system (in which the letters HA appear dripped over an FU) from the latter Using words to build a wardrobe explained Mannerheim reinforces the semiotics of style  and self-expression Basically we can choose to communicate overtly by sporting an oxford shirt patched and embroidered with Montgomerys words or a T-shirt printed and embroidered with Hacks Or else we leave ourselves open to interpretation when we wear a mannish peony pink suit or a tailored jacket featuring unraveled pleated cuffs Like the contrast in tone established by their guest contributors (who incidentally have known each other for 15 years) the collection boiled down to counterintuitive pairings striped silk pajama pants with a black leather bra a languid ivory robe coat disciplined with black straps down the sleeves and extra-long feather-printed shirttails trailing from snug cavalry jackets There was also a Belgian influence  la Dries Ann and Veroniqueunspoken yet unmistakablewhich they used to dial up the poetic rawness Mannerheim mentioned how artists be it the Beats or Impressionists have proven stronger as collectives than as individuals And indeed one cant help but wonder whether this duo is too reliant on its Other But then as one of Hacks other musings seemed to suggest the essence of cultural is the cult$$In recent seasons Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta have risen to industry-wide prominence with their label often described as arty avant garde or post-gender The RISD grads have a real point of view (a rarer thing than you might think) which is unlike anything else on the New York schedule For Spring they came up with an evocative collection working as usual without set concepts (no Paris in the 70s or the work of Jackson Pollock for these two) When the bicoastal designers convened in their New York studio to prepare for todays show they were struck by a feeling that fairly pulsed through their samples lust Whether the stuff of the id or just ideas that are bubbling around in Pops collective unconsciousness (some would say between the runway and the red carpet were more preoccupied with baring it all than ever before) these clothes were hot-blooded and also eerily poignant For some the nudity (transparent pieces galore) on Eckhaus Lattas catwalk will be the foremost topic of conversation but as Eckhaus and Latta approached the idea it had to be among fashions least gaze-oriented expressions of the body These might be clothes about titillation but they didnt seem intended to titillate Chalk some of that up to the casting choices Alongside proper models were extended EL family of various ages and walks of life (Dev Hynes Juliana Huxtable Alexandra Marzella and Grace Dunham among others) Even the bits that didnt bare it all revealed plenty Consider pants slashed along the knees or the back of calves or a slip dress hem that fell above the knee to reveal a flash of thigh Even when Rihanna shows up in a sheer body stocking theres the sense that she has revealed less than these clothes did The collection was largely stripped bare with gorgeous anemone-like body pieces crafted from glass bugle beads functioning as one of a couple of nods to self-ornamentation in the traditional sense Beyond the conceptual there were plenty of just plain great clothes here and wearable to boot The most transparent styles would work well for layering meanwhile a cropped suede mock turtleneck and the sensuous peach velvet suit were things that many a front row guest was keen to wear straight off the runway The cerebral and the visceral in one collection Now thats versatility$$Edeline Lee drew upon a pleasing confluence of inspirations this season The London-based designer was having a Richard Diebenkorn moment appreciating the painters Ocean Park series when it struck her that the artists palette and his geometries dovetailed with those of the designers of the Memphis Group The graphic Memphis look is trending in fashion these days and Lee wound up leaning toward that aesthetic as she whipped up pieces for her new collection the influence was particularly clear in items such as the shift and maxi-length shirtdress featuring a multicolored geometric placement of prints These looks had plenty of pop but Lee was onto something fresher in the garments that conjured Diebenkorns more poetic tone and softer line Specifically the designer had winners in her twisted tops and dresses in a painterly jacquard and the plainspoken white or pastel-colored halter tops and culottes which suggested Diebenkorns brand of California cool without hammering the reference home Elsewhere a pencil dress that collaged several pastel-patterned fabrics married the softness of Diebenkorns canvases with the architectural sensibility of the Memphis school Lee sometimes has a habit of overworking her designs but she mostly kept a lid on that here She flubbed a few pieces by introducing unnecessary sculptural flourishes or insisting on an out-of-whack proportion but where she kept her looks simple and let their fine materials gorgeous palette and cheerful geometries do the talking the clothes didnt just speak they began to sing$$Tethering high-fashion values to sustainable ones isnt an easy task yet its something that creative director Danielle Sherman has managed to do since she took the helm of Edun in 2013 The brands commitment to producing ethically sound clothing in Africa is now a decade deep thanks to founders Ali Hewson and Bono and for Sherman the continent has been a rich source of inspiration too  This season it was the ceremonial dance costumes of the Kuba Kingdom in Central Africa that piqued the designers interest and those familiar with the tribes distinctive graphic textiles might have picked up on the influence in the hand-loomed polka-dot pattern on a fringed jumpsuit Beyond that though the references were anything but literal Intricate African craftwork was subtly woven throughout insteadbe it on the tassel of a pointy slipper that was made in Morocco or the macram trimming of a modish cropped suit fabricated in Madagascar  There was a gentle 30s sway to the collection tooa nod to Dada performance artist Sophie Taeuber-Arpand you could see signs of it in the contrast stitching of pleated pinafore dresses  and the neckline of a charming sailor-inspired look One standout top in workmans orange was a particularly compelling take on the off-the-shoulder trend thats been sweeping both the runway and the streets this season Given that the brands sleek new line of handbags was manufactured in South Africa its clear that Sherman is charting new territory with Edun in more ways than one$$People only vaguely familiar with the label Electric Feathers may be tempted viewing its collections to see very little change over the years Members of the growing Electric Feathers club can see the evolution however Designer Leana Zuniga is committed to certain looksblouson trousers architectural sundresses rope-necked jumpsuitsbut shes updated her silhouettes of late and elevated her fabrications The most obvious change this season was Zunigas deployment of print which she generally eschews Her fine stripe and tonal ikat introduced a distinct albeit understated sense of rhythm to the pieces where they were found while a more graphic print of joined hands added some jolt to the new collection without detracting from its overall minimalist hippie vibe Electric Feathers aficionados will also note that Zuniga jettisoned her signature harem pant silhouette in favor an exaggerated jodhpur girls with a religious affinity for harem hems can continue to find them in the one-shoulder knee-length romper another new shape Zunigas best innovation on that front however was her broad-legged trouser and jumpsuit with an overlayer of fabric that made the items read more like a voluminous skirt or dress Pieces like that explain the Electric Feathers cult These are clothes impossible to categorize as casual or dressy You can wear them either way and theyre both at once The tailored garments that punctuated the collection erred more toward the casual side items in peach-toned silk lam veered dressy But Zunigas allergy to fussiness always prevails and to such a degree that its possible to overlook the rigor of her method But make no mistake As this season reaffirmed Leana Zuniga brings a steel-spined discipline to bear on her project which is to reinvent the look and feel of the basic$$Elie Saab is an eveningwear specialist with an established formula for often monochromatic unapologetically romantic gowns studded with embellishment thats as intricate as his ambition is straightforward Saab wants to make his customers happy Many of these customersliterally hundreds of themwere at his show today as usual accounting for one enormous big-haired and super-spritzed bank of seating at his Tuileries venue What they saw though seemed subtly different from the designers tried-and-tested narrative Its not different demurred the man himself backstage afterward Its the same But the mix is different  In short this meant the insertion of more separates and versatile day-to-night pieces before the introduction of Saabs nocturnal standards For proof inspect the first looks on two of his big-name castings Both Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner wore mid-length dresses Hadids was tiered in blue lace Jenners black and with an empire line Over these they wore bomber jacketsHadids in rich candy-striped gazar Jenners in a more softly toned floral embroidery Although he is not entirely new to the bomber to put both of these bound-to-be-Instad models in the jacket sent a message this was Saab-meets-street To underline that there was a distinctly un-Saab black-flashed white tracksuit worn with flat sandals and Jenners floral bomberwhich acted as a radical foil to the more conventional pussy-bowed white jacket and wide pants in broderie anglaise that had preceded it Leather mini suits with small floral cutouts a soft silk armless striped jacket a cute black lace bomber and a crystal-spattered floral-patched halter-neck white minidress  (almost tennis-like in its silhouette) were a few other examples of the new elements in Saabs mix It made for a pleasantly broadened watching experience But he was careful to emphasize however that he wasnt about to throw the baby out with the bathwater He makes a mean macram lace gownsimultaneously wistful and willful of aspectand there were plenty here The closer to the finale the denser the eveningwear became alive with fin sparkle ripple and train By the time his stars reappearedJenner in a deep-V crystal and lace jumpsuit with two trails of sheer black silk that ran from shoulder to ankle and whipped in the air as she walked and Hadid in a complicatedly luxe-goth black open-front dress of lace and silk panelsnormal service had resumed Ive just met many of my clients now and everybody is happy reported Saab And if theyre happy hes happy$$The playful artisanal vibes that trended heavily on the Fall runways are still a big message for Spring 16 particularly for contemporary brands like Elie Tahari The designer was thinking about the intersection of natural and future this season so he moved away from the architectural silhouettes hes known for and embraced an easier more bohemian sensibility Billowing chiffon dresses deconstructed tweed jackets and loose-fitting trousers in soft shades of taupe cream and black felt destined for a trip to the sun-baked desert New for Tahari was the mix of textures like a jeweled tank with a raw linen skirt or a suede safari jacket over a ramie dress Pat Cleveland took the stage in a twill coat spliced with swaths of lace appliqu paired with ankle-length pants and gladiator sandals it was arguably the best outfit Cleveland always looks sensational but she embodied Taharis ideal woman in that all-white ensemble It was sharp sophisticated and feminine but with a new sense of warmth$$Kym Ellerys inspiration this season was the 1969 work Wrapped Coast by Christo and Jeanne-Claude which found the famed land artistes covering one and a half miles of rocky Sydney coastline in tarp The reference was legible on a literal level in the clothes that Ellery showed this morning but it almost worked better as a metaphor for her development as a designer in the past year Ellery has always exuded a vast ambition but she seems now to have made peace with the idea that the only way to execute her ambitions is to discipline them strap them down The designers evolved sense of rigor was nowhere better demonstrated here than in her approach to volume She still likes her clothes to take up lots of space but she found lots of ways in this collection to control her volumes or concentrate them into small significant gestures An example of the latter were Ellerys artfully suspended bell-shaped sleeves one particularly good instance of the former was the navy silk sundress that shed gathered here and there to create rows of soft pleats Ellerys volumes felt targeted and specific in other words With volume playing a supporting role much of the drama of this collection came from its fabrications Ellery is a textile obsessive and she deployed some outstanding ones this seasonvelvets printed in a sea-pod pattern a feathery cream-colored knit fused to create weight cloudy jacquard crepes silks and shirting cottons with an ultra-luxe hand You didnt have to get close to the clothes to appreciate the excellence of the materials it was self-evident from the way everything draped Ellerys standout material though was the crinkly metallic fabric she used in her shows terrific closing looks Ellery showed off her design maturity in those looks by not gilding the lilythe fabric was gilded enough all it required was a simple pencil-snug shape$$Great designers greatness is stamped on our memory by the signature codes they leave behind them Hence when other designers succeed the houses founder they face a challenge a delicate wrestle between the codes they have signed up to inherit and the urge to express their own point of view Their own codes in fact Today Fausto Puglisi cleverly sucked the tension out of that dialectic by focusing on Emanuel Ungaros joyfully frothy output of the late 60s and early 70s It was a neat little maneuver by sidestepping Ungaro-in-his-80s-pomp for Ungaro juvenilia Puglisi had something new to play with As the mood board demonstrated Ungaro in the 60s was a man of his timeand a designer whose years working at Balenciaga and most powerfully at Courrges could be seen in his work Puglisi chose to focus on a set of sweetly provocative floral macram looks all froth and of-that-era liberation touched with a softened Space Age futurism Impressively Puglisi re-established a connection with the Swiss factory that made Ungaros 60s pieces to create a wonderfully psychedelic lace macram of ochre flowers and paisley petals used in his last capeletteamed with matching thigh-highsand a long loose skirt The netted-check that ran throughout the collection even down to the weave of the pressed-foam ruffles that edged many of these looks appeared to be lifted from a pair of pants one of the mood board images showed Ungaro fitting on Twiggy A harder more Puglisi-ish preoccupationFaustianexpressed itself in the ringlet bonding on black vinyl and hot pink skirts and as suspension on floral-scattered bustiers A little bit bondage maybe but also    romantic Puglisi ventured backstage we had a laugh at that This is not a collection for wallflowers or delicate petalsbut for a woman in search of punchy in-your-face prettiness it will have allure$$Emilia Wickstead a designer known for dressing some of the most high-profile women in London society rolled out a bubblegum pink carpet for her models today That saccharine color was perhaps a nod to the 50s optimism that inspired the collection which was awash with soft hues recalling the era such as pistachio mustard and apricot It was the floral prints though which could have been swiped from a 50s dining room that made the biggest impression The cropped high-waisted pants and blouse that were sprigged with contrasting flower arrangements for instance were a modern way to wear the traditional ladylike motif Of course dresses are still Wicksteads mainstay and there were plenty to choose from The designer isnt one to shy away from volume one billowing geometric print look fell somewhere between a cape and a dress and another came with an impressive Watteau train Her experiments with proportion were at their most successful when confined to the sleeve of a frock somehow the gathered bishop sleeves felt more medieval than mid-century modern a vaguely Game of Thrones-ian feeling that has been coming through this season (Incidentally Michele Clapton the shows costume designer is up for an Emmy Award this weekend) That subtle yet dramatic approach to evening will no doubt find favor with Wicksteads circle of well-dressed and well-connected fans$$Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication it has been said Emilio de la Morena took that principle to heart this season And thank goodness De la Morenas dressmaking talents shine brightest when he pares his looks down to their essences yet he frequently evinces an aversion to doing that as though afraid his designs wont seem distinctive unless he overcomplicates them Not so here This was a collection with a straightforward mandatepretty dressesand its flourishes were relatively few Which made for some knockout frocks to wear to a cocktail do  The designer presented a fabric-focused lineup De la Morena has great taste when it comes to textiles and the materials he used served to elevate his most matter-of-fact looks The cream-color jacquard for instance introduced an earthy note to a soign pencil dress courtesy of the pebbled texture Tonal striped black gazar was not only sexy given its semi-transparency but it also allowed de la Morena to play with his signature geometric effects without detracting from the collections understated mood Elsewhere plain pink or yellow silk had a perfect limpid drapeone of those qualities in clothes that looks no-brainer but is actually devilishly hard to achieve The most striking pieces meanwhile were the pastel frocks and dressy separates embroidered with patches in metallic brocade The patches were in the shape of mountain flowers de la Morena said the pattern they made was redolent of leopard print which wasnt a bad thing There was also a very cool green-toned organza brocade with metallic fabric filaments left exposed The effect was a touch uncanny in a good way and here in particular de la Morenas strategy of hewing to classic A-line silhouettes allowed the specialness of his material to speak for itself This collection wasnt simple in the sense that it was minimal or basic It was simple in that it wasnt cluttered by a bunch of superfluous ideas There were just a couple of superfluities but then simplicity is a discipline Its a muscle This season de la Morena began again to work it out$$Emilio Pucci opened his first store in Capri in 1949 serving up kaleidoscopic printed dresses that by the 60s had become signifiers of a jet-set lifestyle recognizable well beyond Italian vacation destinations Massimo Giorgetti the young founder of MSGM one of Milan's recent success stories took the wheel at the iconic house earlier this year after Peter Dundass departure For his debut today Giorgetti started at the seaside which was the right instinct As the birthplace of Pucci it was a natural place for a new beginning  Giorgetti uncovered some compelling pieces from the archives a glance at his backstage mood board suggested he has an eye for the more obscure elements in the Pucci oeuvre Unfortunately this show was a bit of a muddle too literal in its references (there were sea turtles and lobsters tangled up in a fishnet dress) too dependent on styling and surprisingly low on prints Though it seems a shame to ignore them especially for a designer who built his business on irreverent mashups of color texture and pattern prints aren't the only route to success at Pucci The industry has seen enough revivals to know that it takes more than reverence for a houses heritage to make things click for an incoming designer But spelling out the founder's first name in script across the back of a slip dress along the borders of a shift and on the straps of flat sandals isn't the way to go either Hiring Giorgetti for the job indicated that the Pucci powers-that-be were after a radical change targeting the street style and Instagram-obsessed younger crowd that's been his sweet spot at MSGM That in and of itself isnt a negative and there are clearly larger opportunities at lower price points But Giorgetti has some work to do to right this ship$$Has a gray Armani pantsuit ever before been worn with a cropped T-shirt with a smiley emoji on it Doubtful but theres always a first time for everything and that was the way Giorgio Armani chose to open his Spring Emporio show maybe to emote a little casualness He got rid of his runway too and instead had his models walk on an illuminated path as if at street level (that is as street level as you can get when youre showing inside the vast Tadao Ando theater youve installed inside your own lofty building) In a funny way this is a favorable fashion moment for Armani againthings have generally turned relaxed and casual and he is once more a flat-shoe man in a flat-shoe time (exactly what Armani endured during the long reign of mega-platforms may only be imagined) So now he can get back to his natural state putting models in low pointy ankle boots and a variety of casual-formal sporty-pretty shorts jackets and tops for spring Gone are the days when Armani shows were essays in a million shades of greige (There was a time for greige lets remember It was the color of armor an entire generation of pioneering American power women wore to go into executive battle from the late 70s through the early 90s) This time he added a powdery bois de rosepink by any other namein a variety of techniques that hinted at flowers be that brocaded floral tailoring or a soft hybrid of blouse and jacket laser-cut into overlapping petals$$Erdems first look said it all A girl with a slightly trance-like expression on her pale face was treading her way along a red earth pathway prettily dressed in a delicate Victoriana yoked dress of pale gray chiffon strewn with embroidered pink and white flowers which seemed to be coming apart at the shoulders So far so enchantingbut what the designer said about his inspiration will make you go back and take a long second look It was about prairie madness he explained backstage In 1862 Abraham Lincoln passed the Homestead Act which gave single women and widows the right to their own plots of land in the West as long as they stayed there for five years So there were all these women coming from their homes in Europe bringing their clothes and the remnants of their lives in Norway and Germany and places like thatand they started to suffer from agoraphobia and all kinds of psychological illnesses A quick Wikipedia check also shows that suicide was not uncommon among these lonely women Could that black velvet ribbon at her neck knotted and displaced to the side start to look a little different in that light Erdems productions have taken on an almost cinematic quality recently often hinting at the backstories of imaginary girls and women who have fallen on hard times or traveled far from their secure homes Last season he placed his show in a down-at-the-heels 50s apartment set belonging to an heiress whose hopes in life were unraveling before that it was a tropical greenhouse for a tale about a Victorian woman botanist Part of this he always says comes from spending his boyhood obsessively watching Merchant Ivory films Hes a romantic who can only design once he knows the character hes dressing The prairie girls with their extraordinary wardrobes of ankle-length flounced dresses made of beautifully wrought lace crochet and embroidery fabrics are his sequel They arrived by railroadpushed along on an actual train track in a former freight yard in the hinterland of Kings Cross station with a few sticks of furniture to their names and then proceeded to make their long melancholy walk to a crackly soundtrack of Emily Dickinsons poetry Well put it another way Erdem may be brilliant at research and atmospherics but in the real world he also knows the minds of the women he actually dresses Next summer they are basically going to be in prettiness heaven$$Since her very first collection in 2005 Erin Fetherston immediately established her universe as one of whimsy and hyper-femininity Jeans have hardly had a place in the designers fairy tale But this season she surprised by showing a handful of laid-back denim pieces inspired by fashions perennial muse Jane Birkin Fetherston should step out of her comfort zone more often The overalls shorts and culottes in soft dark denim provided a welcome antidote to the designers tendency toward the overly sweet Also new for the brand a capsule collection of minaudires that recalled needlepoint hoops and were stitched with cute phrases faces or the word love Branching out into accessories is almost always a smart decision for a fledgling labeleven more so when they are as Instagrammable as these Fetherston hit the nail on the head Needlepoint was a recurring theme in the collection paying homage to the designers other muse this season Anne of Avonlea the early-20th-century Prince Edward Islanddwelling heroine of the Anne of Green Gables series Arcadian reverie is how Fetherston described it There was certainly a pastoral beauty to the floral-print dresses and skirts some cut with a train or layered with delicate sheer fabric that billowed behind the models as they walked Slips in sky blue baby pink and navy provided a base for some of these sheer looks and also stood on their own topped at times with a matching knife-pleated capelet White lace maxi dresses with high necks hinted at the Edwardian lace and collars worn by Anne in her dayand reclaimed decades later by Birkin Like all of Fetherstons collections Spring was romanticyet it was a grown-up romance$$Its a passion play of opposites said an upbeat Ermanno Scervino backstage before rushing out to greet Italys First Lady Agnese Landini a friend and loyal client The collection he presented today celebrated his signature hyper-feminine Italian-diva style though he tempered it with a contrasting dose of masculine and sporty elements Fortunately for Scervinos fans this did not tarnish the glam factor on the contrary it polished the edges giving the lineup a contemporary feel Craftsmanship took center stage with an elaborate display of materials textures and finishes Lace was utilized in myriad waysbonded with a double layer of delicate guipure embroidered with macram and jacquard feuillage and fused with cashmere pashmina to sumptuous effect The silhouettes were either elongated and slim or sensual and shapely evening fabrics were worked into tailored day coats and pantsuits Light organza gave shape to a classic tuxedo duster worn with cropped pants and flat embroidered babouches In another clever conception a sporty olive green jumpsuit was paired with a luxe mink jacket dyed a bright shade of bubblegum pink Masculine shirts in crisp striped poplin were a chic counterpoint to tight duchesse satin pencil midi skirts while shades of lipstick red served as an unexpected and striking contrast to a delicate periwinkle hue The result was a lineup of edge and modernity spicing up Scervinos trademark sensual touch$$Though Escada wont officially turn 40 until 2018 the Munich-based brand has already started celebrating For his Spring 2016 offering fashion director Daniel Wingate sought to emphasize the history of the label without getting stuck in the past The piece that perhaps best typified this effort was a silky tailored blazer inspired by Escadas scarves from the late 60s and 70s which was paired with smart black trousers Its the kind of thing that serves a woman equally well at the office or at a cocktail party Versatility and comfort were key this season Looks were styled with flats to emphasize a certain effortlessness to the clothes that will appeal to Escadas busy career woman Slouchy trousers roomy culottes and oversize tunics popped up in neutrals as well as primary colors like red and yellow (or limoncello as the brand calls it) The eveningwear was also carefully considered A romantic delicate blush pink cardigan was a thoughtful additionfor the demure or the always-coldto the matching strapless dress it was styled with Escada is best when it sticks to simplicity The floral pantsuit and chain-link belt felt overcomplicated and the jumpsuit-gown combo though daring seemed a little out of place Still simple neednt mean boring One of the strongest looks consisted of perforated white leather culottes styled with a white shirt that wrapped at the waist$$This time last year Esteban Cortazar presented a collection that hed already sold to retailers during the Resort seasonorders were placed even before the press weighed in While rethinking the industry cycle might not be half as sexy as Roos Abelss absshe being the very young model who opened tonights showit does help explain how Cortazar seems to have settled into the fashion firmament so fast  And now that his brand is viable he can start having fun which meant channeling an otherworldly creature as his latest muse Hence the python bra top asymmetric metallic leather gilet and platform sandals encrusted with Swarovski crystals Compared with Cortazars past two go-rounds this collection felt less mannered more spontaneous as he put it He credited the ideas to night-long parties in Ibiza this summer and how the clubbing impulse dates back more than half his life to when he was a precocious teen in Miami Beyond flaunting youthful vibes the pieces boasted savoir faire Laser-cut skins were backed in metallic jersey Lurex knit was developed to resemble a surface of jewels and then lined in cashmere so that it would feel soft not scratchy and metal rings were affixed onto coats like contraband watches creating a clanging chorus with each step It was about not being afraid to just play said Cortazar The past two seasons I was building her universe this season I just wanted her to be brave A clingy jersey dress slashed with shimmer has already proven a retail favorite as has an oversize shirt that billows from behind Tellingly they represent two of Cortazars easier looks yet theyre sure to get heads turning from dusk to dawn$$Veronica Etro today delivered a sumptuous medley of house staplesthe kaleidoscopic prints the rich concentration of color and the bohemian sensibilityin a collection that also melded European folk costume Victorian Pre-Raphaelite nostalgia haberdashery Arts and Crafts and a shot of Ballets Russes It was pretty busy Yet it was to Etros great credit that with so very much going on here at first glance nothing on the runway ever seemed especially OTTFor while there was plenty of ruche and flounce and ruffle in her silhouettes particularly on the soft undulations of her sleeves these were never jarringly proportioned piecesTo get lost you had to stareintothe clothes On one look alone quilted printed cotton was shot against gridded twine run through with embroidered ribbons that were overlaid with ivory silk and hemmed with silver lace above a scalloped hem Reversible bombers combined strata of ribbon and dvor silk A lace-fringed dress was a patchwork of floral-wrought paisleypatterns drawn from the Etro archiveoverlaid with a hypnotic constellation of dots that recalled the antipodean psychedelia of Kean Etros most recent menswear show Backstage Etro said that she had left some of the finishes rough in the wine-toned closing section to resist the sweetness and whimsy so much ornament might otherwise muster There was friction and roughness and pain in this romance just so emotional perfection was not the objective In a season that is betting heavy on 2010s appropriations of kooked-up 70s approximations (thinkPicnic at Hanging Rock) of Edwardian lady laciness Etros analogue abandon was a cynicism-free take Victoriana eminently incorporable into the cool-girl wardrobe$$Eudon Choi spirited showgoers away to Gaelic lands with a palette-cleansing collection that sprung from the fantastical paintings of John Anster Fitzgerald The Victorian artist known for fairy-filled works that may have been opium-fueled brought an ethereal touch to Chois otherwise minimalist spring outing The sprightly references came through from the delicate sprays of pale blue lace that showed up on sleeves and skirts right down to the pleasingly off-kilter mismatched Victoriana boots There was another very on-point mood at work here though the waif-like lines of the grunge era This was a fairy fantasy with an undeniably 90s edge The decades strong stripped-back feel appeared in the industrial slate fabrics that opened the show on layered dresses and capes and later in the raw-edged drape shirts and asymmetric slash skirts hewn in tactile Irish linen As the dreamy chords of Portisheads It Could Be Sweet played out the palette shifted from cerise to soft peach to midnight blue with Mackintosh-y dresses that Choi intends to be worn to smart gallery shows There was a breezy oversize silhouette throughout as well as a minor obsession with drawstrings which allowed Choi free play with shape and volume Gone were the harsh and architectural lines of Fall In their place came a lesson in restrained prettiness For the finale these proportions became even more exaggerated in pale hued jacquard day gowns that provided full cover Theres so much body consciousness in the world Choi said after the show referring to the protective feel of the more voluminous looks I wanted to create an elegant and easy beauty that allows an escape from that$$Brooklyn may be trending in Paris but the vibe at Faith Connexions headquarters is distinctly LA sur la Seine Step through the door at its htel particulier (part of which is a small hotel) and a certain very famous someones matte black Porsche Panamera is parked there In the courtyard members of fashions fabulous class are gossiping while eating lunch while texting on their iPhones At the reception a fashion shoot in which a blogger poses lying shoeless underneath an antique chair is taking place  Upstairs in the showroom where the racks are lined with torn jeans graffitied leather jackets and lacy white dresses that look like they stepped off the set of Guns N' Roses November Rain video the sales are brisk Faith Connexion has never done a runway show and refuses to name its designer (it's more or less an open secret that former Balmain creative director Christophe Decarnin is in charge) The brand has caught on in spite of all that because nobody nails the grungy I-woke-up-like-this lifestyle better For spring the attitude is essentially the same as previous seasons only more California-fied Tropical prints registered as new as did sweatshirts spray-painted with palm trees Hammer pants which take their name from Oakland Californias native son MC Hammer even turned up But the big winners here will be the oversize army jackets tagged by Faith Connexion's resident graffiti artists whose appeal appears to be universal A rep reports they sent 25 of said jackets to a Seoul Korea store and they sold out in a week In a savvy development the brand is now also customizing the jackets to clients' specifications$$Caitlin Price is London fashions latest phenom Much like Simone Rocha Pricewho showed her second collection today as part of the Fashion East lineup of emerging designersmade her mark on the scene by inventing a new kind of girl one with her own distinctive look and attitude Only time will tell whether the Caitlin Price woman will prove to be as multidimensional as the one Rocha dreamed up This season Price has sharpened her outlines showing new versions of the luxuriously fabricated beautifully detailed tracksuits that she offered in her debut and expanding her dialogue between high and low aesthetics by creating half-gown skirts and cutaway nightclubbing dresses that had the tough tone and casual mien of streetwear The mix of silk and poly taffetas in the looks underscored the high-low theme Price is up to something genuinely interesting but she gave few hints here as to how she plans to augment her design vocabulary In the meantime though she has gotten everyones attention This Is The Uniform a new entry into Fashion East is the brainchild of recent Goldsmiths grad Jenna Young Its her bad luck that she was showing with Price inasmuch as the two cover similar territory Youngs debut likewise toyed with ways to draw appreciative attention to and elevate the look of working-class youth Her take was less audacious and clear-cut than Prices but on the other hand more expansive Her mix of sharp crop tops net sweaters A-line minidresses and trousers slungvery  inventivelybelow the hip hinted at a strong instinct for creating the elements of a womans wardrobe as opposed to a few strong headline pieces Fellow Fashion East newcomer Richard Malone also concerns himself with the working class His modus operandi is more conceptual however than that of Young or Price For starters theres his approach to fabrication Malones workwear materials were sourced from overstock and other types of waste and though he elevated these fabrics by sculpting them into rather soign shapes he maintained a sense of matter-of-factness by eschewing corsetry or other restrictive elements His clothes are made to function And the emphasis on wearability went to the collections overarching theme which was a celebration of female labor at home and in the workplace A high-waisted flared jumpsuit with a ruffled halter neck didnt at first seem like a garment that could withstand the trenches but in fact it was cut precisely to stand up to a hard days work Ditto a striped dress expanding in wavelike volume as it extended toward the knee Malones look was intriguing but it was his sensitivity to the user experience of his clothes that makes him one to keep an eye on$$Faustine Steinmetz turned the idea of denim inside out with her first collection and the intricate hand-loomed pieces she created from recycled thrift-store jeans were anything but basic In her third season the French designer is looking to grow her business beyond the confines of her atelier in East London She partnered with a denim mill in Spain for Spring 2016 and the resulting collaboration takes her artisanal sensibilities to exciting and scalable places Micro-pleated denim is among the new fabric developments in her repertoire (clearly the Issey Miyake ripple effect we saw come through in New York is making waves across the pond too) and it gave a sculptural dimension to such staples as the jean jacket To add to her experiments with true blues Steinmetz took to deconstructing the tracksuit with what shes calling dvor jersey one classic gray marl sweatshirt in particular unraveled into a stream of floor-grazing fringing Her couture-like weaving expertise showed up in the hand of a striped polo shirt which like the pieces of her first collection took a week to make In an age when supply and demand often takes precedence in the fashion food chain its encouraging to see a young designer picking up the thread of time-honored production values in a modern wardrobe with such spellbinding innovation$$Fausto Puglisi admitted to a case of nerves before his show today Since he arrived on the Milan Fashion Week scene three years ago embroideries have been his stock in trade bold brassy and full-throttle Possessing as strong a signature as Puglisi does is something of a mixed blessing We all love a designer with a recognizable voice but sooner or later that voice starts to sound familiar Puglisis new collection for Spring represented his biggest step yet away from the embellishments with which he made his name hence the nerves  Citing Madame Grs and Halston as reference points Puglisi embraced silk jersey with a hand so supple so liquid that it has to be touched to be appreciated But even without copping a feel you could tell he was up to something new and different with a draped ivory gown boasting an asymmetrical cape straight out of ancient Greek statuary We expect to see that dress making the rounds this awards season It was that soign Other goddess dresses in that same material be they short or suspended from a bandeau bathing suit top or in a bright combination of red white and blue struck a more expected note They werent bad they just didnt have that element of surprise  In the end this collection wasnt a complete departure anyway There were scads of Puglisis beloved embroideries but he gave them a novel spin mixing honest-to-goodness seashells with sprays of multicolor rhinestones part Malibu part Dallas with some fine Italian-made intarsia knits thrown into the mix Not for the timid but then thats never been the Puglisi way We have a hunch that the encrusted cowboy boots if he winds up retailing them could become a mini cult hit$$One can always count on a pithy comment from those Milan stalwarts Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi Chaotic elegance deadpanned Rimondi describing the design duos latest collection for Fay which is one part of the Tods empire It was also an apt phrase to describe many of the showgoers outfits as heavy rainstorms lashed the city on its first day of runway shows causing inevitable traffic havoc and wardrobe mayhem But chaotic is not a word one would ordinarily use to describe these designers aesthetic which tends to be defined by pristine prettified clothes This season their deft precision was worked on the military field jacket a small point of reference and its myriad possibilities Where a chaotic notion entered it was in setting the rigor of combat garb against traditional paisley curlicues embroidery ruching and prints that had a shade of Bloomsbury about them The elongated sleeve proportions added a more youthful element to the uniform improvisation Floral-print dresses and pretty separates like a cute blush suede frock came with scalloped sleeves and cutout paisley swirls To counter some of that girlishness and with a knowing nudge to the designers desire to add a younger following to their loyal clientele the Fay field jacket will likely have mass appeal It hit their runway in numerous iterations cropped and in a more urban denim version in white There were navy incarnations too and a series of embroidered styles had a semblance of Tyrolean influence A small idea for a larger world$$What if the Lisbon sistersthe five doomed girls at the center of The Virgin Suicideshad never killed themselves Imagining an alternate happier history for the Lisbons inspired the Spring collection of Felder Felder the London-based brand designed by German identical twin sisters Daniela and Annette Felder In their version the Lisbons party their way from Michigan to Miami and age disgracefullythink The Golden Girls gone wild The oily blue in the metallic fabric of their first outfits a sharply cut broad-lapel suit and follow-up dresses shone sickly slick Banana palm and flamingo prints appliqus and jacquards were scrambled and diffused as if squinted at through aging eyes  There was a potent dose of the staple Felder fare that their lushly blow-dried regulars had come to whoop for floor-length underwear revealers skater skirts with cutaways at the hip crop tops aplenty and a chiffon baby doll Yet there was a pitch at maturity toothis show was about the Lisbons growing up after allin a suite of Art Baselappropriate cream looks in silk jersey twisted only by the odd Lurex-piped panel or cry-for-help undone shirt A tomato pink and white color-block aside was carefully conventional And despite the artificial whoa there clash of pink apricot and gold in their tropical jacquard the fabric was used to hew restfully nipped dresses pencils and outerwear  Afterward Annette Felder observed that this kind of harmonious dichotomy is something the designers do naturally Its always hard and its always soft and that comes from our being twins So whos the hard sister and whos the gentler one It changes both chimed into avoid being hard on each other$$Sick although in quite agoodway Thats the only possible response to the coral leather mini-bloomer playsuit that proceeded fourth in the Fendi collection today Coral Leather Bloomer Playsuit Such a thing could no doubt cause ridicule offense or even pity if viewed on the everyday street Yet when seen with our fashion glasses on we can instantly perceive that this garment has precisely the right number of attractive-repulsive features to qualify it as ideally avant-garde It has the puff-shoulder sleeves the 80s-yet-not yoke the gathering into a high-neck nearly-but-not-Victorian collar While below it provides exactly the correct amount of photographer-attractor leg exposure to satisfy girls who congregate at and outside fashion shows  Fendi is a serious Roman fur and leather house of long standing but recently Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi have been having some fun with it all There are no references remarked Lagerfeld as he moved through the roiling postshow throng Retro is over no Still even when hes supposedly designing against the mainstream Lagerfelds antennae cant help transmitting a sense of the fashion news that is running through Spring It was there in the silhouettesthe big-sleeved high-neck high-waisted and pleated midi thing thats currently going on In Fendis case they provide the backdrop for ultra-luxurious house materials and skills summer furs in a rattan-basketwork open-weave technique cropped jackets in whipstitched patchwork python and braiding and smocking effects Fendi x Karl Lagerfeld may be 50 years old as a collaboration but in some ways its still ridiculously friskily young Again in a good way$$The palazzo pajama was originally created by Irene Galitzine a cultivated Russian princess turned couturiere who lived in Rome in the 60s Her clientele ranged from thegrandesdames of the Roman aristocracy to Audrey Hepburn Jackie Kennedy was also a fan and sent her a lovely thank-you note in 1963 that read I was so touched at your thoughtfulness in sending me your marvelous pajamas for Christmas But it was her friend Diana Vreeland who with her usualpanache gave the chic ensemblea masculine-inspired blouse paired with wide pantsthename thats still used to these days that has become synonymous with a sensual androgynous and eccentric way of dressing The fashion world has longbeen fascinated bylounge-inspired attire recently almost every known designerhas tapped into what has become a global trend But for Francesca Ruffini a refined woman with a calm demeanor the passion for pajamas reaches back to her personal lifestyle and to her desire for both comfort and elegance Ive always lived in a pajama because it has a uniform quality that I find appealing itsthe first thing I wear when coming back home after a day outside she said during the presentation of her Spring collection held in her sprawling flat in the heart of Milan Her pajamas are veritable pantsuits that can be worn 24/7 carrying you from day to night or can be worn as separates I likethe monogrammed jackets of my custom-made pajamas with a demure midi skirt the pants look great with a tailored blazer said the designer while pointing out a lineup in sumptuous silks sourced in her native Como and printed exclusively in festive colors Each lookwas accessorized by a sleeping mask that couldmorph into a graceful headband To further demonstrate the already convincing versatility Ruffini expanded the range with fluid robes de chambre (read bathrobes) in elongated linesmade in liquid languid jacquards they were perfectto be worn as dusters or evening dresses The effect was of subtle yet alluring seduction She also added a bra to wear under the coats I hate the look of exposed lingerie she exclaimedin mockhorror But my husband encouraged me to add a sexy-yet-elegant touch to make the look more desirable The husband in question is Remo Ruffini CEO of Moncler who actually happens to know a thing or two about making a successful fashion business His suggestions on the subject cannot be easily overlooked$$For a line that has made its name setting the denim trends beginning with its first pairthe ubiquitous Le Skinny Jean of 2012Frame Denims Spring 2016 presentation began with surprisingly few Actually there werent many bottoms at all The new pant is no pant laughed cofounder Jens Grede at the Soho presentation or is it the Emperor's New Pants Whatever the takeaway it would have been easier if the models didnt look so good Nearly all were clad in 70s-influenced separates (often worn well quite separately) Tight knit tops and tees had sleeves that extended only to the elbow and tucked into fetching A-line skirts long loose jeans were gently cuffed into a more girlfriend-friendly boyfriend jean silhouette snug knit bikinis were sported under multi-pocketed denim jackets and slouchy tops were worn seemingly alone or over the briefest of shorts It appeared to be for all practical purposes a full view into the future wardrobe of every leggy young fashionable thing on the premises as well as those of the heavily Instagrammed runway regulars after whom they model their wardrobes  The intended feel was that of an American girl who falls in love while visiting the 70s French Riviera then began infusing the local wardrobe with American sportswear tropes said Grede name-checking the story of the recording of the Rolling Stones Exile on Main St (a rundown chateau exercises in redefining the term louche for a generation) though the Gallic striped tops and thick elastic headbands in some looks certainly nodded to another famous Riviera-ite namely the classic St-Tropez bombshell herself Brigitte Bardot (who its worth noting also had no problem with not wearing pants in public) Swimwear was a new venture here born out of the organic design process that Grede and cofounder Erik Torstensson have pursued since the labels founding New washes led to new cuts and styles of denim which in turn inspired a shirt trousers in suede and leather and now swim Next time well do something else said Grede Were going to go darker cooler It looks like the emperors have quite a few clothes in their future after all$$Born and bred in Naples (in Pompei no less) Francesco Scognamiglio is still deeply in love with this city of staggering beauty and louche-ness opposites that coexist in a web of inextricable contradictions This clearly feels quite natural for the designer who delves with abandon into Napless history and decadent heritage for inspiration All that was apparent in his Spring collection in which he referenced the esoteric Sansevero Chapel a 16th-century masterpiece that hosts the statue of the Veiled Christa marble wonder that looks so incredibly real as if it were made of actual flesh draped in the thinnest of fabric  Theater mirrors artifice said the designer backstage pointing out wispy ruffled dresses in white and shell pink light as a feather and almost liquid in their sensuality Transparent Chantilly lace and inconspicuous point desprit conjured up a romantic feel for fluctuating long dresses exuding reminiscences of boudoirs and 18th-century courtesansyet they were slashed layered and multitiered to modern effect Black silk mikado jackets with round shoulders felt more substantial they came inlaid with graphic intarsia inspired by peeling stucco ceilings that looked like cracks through which a delicate jade green lining could be glimpsed Dresses in white or black liquid satin were printed and embroidered with an oversize iris motif and adorned with an abundance of rosette appliqus they balanced the overall barely there effect and the nude transparencies of the lineup The craftsmanship was undoubtedly exquisite It makes sense that Scognamigliobacked by a new investor Malaysian entrepreneur Johann Youngwill debut his Haute Couture collection in Paris in 2016 where hell finally fulfill a childhood dream$$Barneys New York has installed Gabriela Hearsts debut collection on its third floor between Chlo and Cline Not bad for a fledgling label in its first season Hearst arrives on the scene with a pedigree she hails from a grand Uruguayan ranching family and shes married to a descendant of William Randolph Hearst but this is no vanity project The proof is in that Barneys exclusive and in her evolving collection When she launched the line in February it was tempting to classify Hearst as another Phoebe Philo disciple a practitioner of the luxe minimal style that has dominated at retail for the past few years But a season later a distinct point of view is emerging one that marries an urbane elegance with a rawer even rustic look that nods at her heritage That difference will work to Hearsts advantage especially as the fashion pendulum swings away from restraint toward a more exuberant sensibility There were any number of understated smartly cut coats and coatdresses here and theyll find plenty of customers when this collection lands on sales floors So too will the streamlined strapless evening column with a built-in choker necklace (it connects to the dress in back) Inevitably though the items that made a stronger statement were the ones for which Hearst took bigger risks A tank dress with floor-sweeping proportions was cut in Lurex-striped gauzebeach fabric she called it adding It makes me feel comfortable when somethings not so perfect Hearst should continue to follow that instinct A rugged washed-cotton field jacket was one of the collections most desirable pieces Elsewhere she took cues from her husbands cycling uniform for a ribbed-knit cashmere dress in bold athletic stripes Sexy as hell it will stand out among the sea of knits about to inundate the runways and its one more reason Hearst should keep going her own way$$Its the rare bird who admits hes not interested in dressing exhibitionists but Gabriele Colangelo is one such individual Theres no sparkling embroidery here quipped the meticulous Italian backstage Listening to the designer who hails from a family of furriers animatedly describe his seasonal fabric innovations is an uncommon experience For his Spring collection utilizing technology to an extent seldom seen he shifted his attention to experiments with velvet (laser-cutting it to resemble the age-old dvor technique) and kidassia (aka goats fur) transporting the materials into shape-shifting textiles and remarkable summer statement pieces The overall silhouette was long and lean narrowly pleated silk tunics were paired with contrastingly hued trousers in lavender copper turquoise and an eye-catching mustard Sleeveless tops velvet-accented slip dresses and a wonderful velvet jumpsuit possessed a similarly elongated feel Symmetry was occasionally broken by the unexpected tweaking of a jackets sleeves many of which had extended cuffs One of Colangelos most interesting new fabrications is a variation of Kentethe West African cloth produced in narrow overlapping strips and usually woven of cotton silk and sometimes gold thread Colangelos version is distinguished by sheared silk threads which from a distance resemble fur He used the fabric to create wispy coats trousers and jackets that were pretty and light as a feather Many of the outfits that followed were similarly tonal and textural at times employing pleats under transparent silk or creative use of kidassia For a handcrafted feel he applied the tufty tone-on-tone material to necklines and hems or worked it as stripes adding a 70s undercurrent and an enticing of-the-moment feel$$Youre so money Recall if you will that unforgettable line from Swingers delivered in the midst of a pep talk at a nightclub Money is the primary way we denote value in our society Youre so money means you have so much value You are so very good Gareth Pughs latest collection was so so money Literally in that there were actual pence coins sewn onto the clothesa gesture that in a different collection youd be tempted to read as a statement about luxury or something along those lines But Pughs money wasnt raising questions It was proposing a solution Go out Go balls out Dress to the nines as though everything this world has to offer belongs to you because it does You can buy whatever you want with the currency that is you Be extravagant with yourself and for gods sake have fun The high spirits of this collection meanwhile raised a question What on earth got into Gareth Pugh this season Heading backstage after this exuberant brilliantly styled show you half-expected to find Pugh bouncing off walls and singing the praises of a new cocktail of serotonin reuptake inhibitors or better yet a new love The truth was rather more prosaic Pugh was up to some point-making here We each contain multitudes was his message and reputedly dour Gareth Pugh is perfectly capable of putting his well-developed design muscles to work in the creation of a collection with a disco mood just as the Gothic Gareth Pugh babes hes cultivated see fit once in a while to slough off their cares and paint the town red  Red was Pughs signature color this season The color pulsed through numerous looks from the impeccably tailored silk faille suits with their flared attenuated silhouettes to the paillette-covered short-shorts made for shimmying The paillettes made perhaps their most stunning appearance in a trim black trench coatthe way the sequins dappled about the coats chest and shoulders suggested the movement of strobe lights dancing over pitch-colored clothes The nightclub atmospherics extended into Halston-esque draped dresses and looks in a black-and-white diamond patterned jacquard that conjured the undying incandescence of club deity Leigh Bowery The nightclub energy was present too in Pughs excellent Mongolian furtrimmed plastic jackets with their frisson of sexual possibility (and perversity) The overall effect was magnificently louche Pugh clearly knew hed be shocking the audience by sending out a collection premised on the pleasure principle Did he know hed be showing them perhaps his best collection ever He probably knew that too Pugh should engage his gaudy side more oftenhere he demonstrated that his rigor as a craftsman can turn pretty much any look into pure class His artistry is so money And Pugh has more where that came from He can afford to spend freely$$Displacement as a positive force Its a theme that in one way or another has often coursed through Gary Grahams clothes His keenly researched collections contain multitudes with enough references to make an art history majors head spin A brief shopping list of a few of his aesthetic touchstones for this season the word asunder Buddhist vestments Iranian carpets historical mourning garb seminal experimental filmmaker Jack Smith and Queen Elizabeth I Generally speaking Graham weaves together such disparate ideas with ease Despite his period fodder the results are unplaceable in time and geography Take silk dresses in an ornate print borrowed from the aforementioned Iranian rugs or a trapeze maxi inspired by a traditional Turkish wedding dress Paneled in black and shimmering gold it was easy to imagine on some cool young thing at one of the citys artier events His message got perhaps a bit muddled in a mixed-media top that married Victorian mutton-chop sleeves tapestry and ticking stripes More winning were dresses in perfectly polished shapes but with plenty of grungy appeal splattered with bleach till they reached an uncanny shade of goldenrod Transformation of another kind was afoot in a grouping of items that riffed on the idea of remnants Graham had lately been reading Chlo Griffins oral history of Cookie Mueller and he tapped into the books descriptions of a thrift store in Muellers native Baltimore The resulting pieces came edged in all manner of metallic sundries Particularly savvy was Grahams decision to build out his offering of pieces that boast a broad appeal but make more of a statement than your pure basics A pair of ethereal blouses a poet number with full sleeves and a sleeveless top with a slashed sheer high neckline both fit the bill as did his supple Peruvian knits in a graphic black-and-white pattern inspired by tile work Grahams lookbook styling may have an editorial loftiness to it but there was a surprising amount of real-world potential to the majority of these clothes$$How do you explain a thing like the red-white-and-bluestriped sequin hot pants at Giamba today Or for that matter the sequined lipstick bullets the sequined red-painted fingernails on embroidered hands the sequined stars daisies planets hearts and stars Well if youre Giambattista Valli you point to legendary 1990s New York club Jackie 60 to Donna Jordan to Tom Wesselmann and above all else to the #FreeTheNipple movement Its really all about Free the Nipple Valli exclaimed backstage after the show and to some degree it really was The very abbreviated frilly hippie frocks the little sister customer (that is in relation to his big girl Giambattista Valli line and one supposes adored child to his big mama couture collection) has come to expect from Giamba were here again only this time with heart- and star-shaped patches-as-pasties much in the manner of the emoji carefully placed by your favorite bare-it-all Instagram star Think an aristocratic Miley Cyrus Some models had their lanky pale hair raked through with pastel pink and lilac dye as if they were members of the Source Family who ran off to Burning Man and never came back Some wore zebra-striped ankle socks with sequined shoes or tutu-style skirts with sweatshirts There may not have been an immediately available narrative through-line but going out clubbingor freeing the nippleis after all chiefly concerned with celebrating a certain joie de vivre And really what are those stars and stripes (even when sequined as a bustier or brief) about if not freedom$$Giambattista Valli has been tending toward a more sixties silhouette in the past few seasons and his familiar full-skirted looks made way for a sharper Youthquakeinspired line today The Italian designer likes to surround himself with a circle of stylish women that spans generations and two of his favorites sat in the front row todayLee Radziwill and Bianca Brandolini DAdda There was an air of romance about the collection that is likely to appeal to both those women starting with the pretty Art Nouveauinspired florals that were present on everything from balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses to neat cropped trouser suits Beyond a penchant for floral prints intricate embellishments are a Valli sweet spot and shimmering 3-D petals found their way onto the thigh-grazing miniskirts and mixed-media A-line coats Naturally Valli designs with a glamorous social calendar in mind and finding new ways to invigorate a black-tie dress code is always on his agenda The silk scarves that topped the bohemian floor-sweeping dresses made for an unexpected alternative to the traditional statement collar With their eye-catching glittering soles the gladiators were a charming and modern re-envisioning of the evening sandal one thats sure to have legs on the red carpet come spring$$Lets start with the last look Because that laser-cut micro-pleated satin organza gown goes a long way toward explaining what was going on at the Giles show tonight Flame-haired Karen Elson emerged looking to all the world like the genetic clone of Queen Elizabeth I reanimated to preside over some postapocalyptic England (or at any rate a United Kingdom of which Elizabeths thorn-in-the-side Scotland is no longer a part) And that was precisely Giles Deacons point The show was held in the Elizabethan-era Banqueting Room in Whitehall a place to which the designer would often retire as a student to get away from hustle and bustle and take in the Rubens murals on the ceiling Hed booked the space for this season a year in advance and a deep dive into the history of the place led him back to Elizabeth and provided him the inspiration for his new clothes In other words this time out Deacon was in one of his historical moods Its a frame of mind that usually results in maximal looks and on that score this collection did not disappoint Working with print designer David Holah of Bodymap Deacon created a print based on a scan of a full-length portrait of Elizabeth I which found its way onto silhouettes as varied as a leotard-taut bodysuit and a diaphanous caftan There were also Baroque wallpaper florals and embroideries based on tapestries But the real drama here was mainly to be found in the collections skirts and sleeves Deacon didnt stint on the volume cutting full bell- and balloon-shaped sleeves and frothing his skirts and dresses with parachute hems or underlying layers of tulle The patterned tights made for a nice complement to all that volume and they conjured a masculine Renaissance-era look Then there were the showpieces Alongside the satin organza gowns worn by Elson and Erin OConnor Deacon displayed his couturier skills in dresses embellished by an overgrown English gardens worth of tulip-shaped florets and finished other more plainspoken dresses with tender little frills As is often the case at Giles the showboating craft threatened to become the collections whole point and this season that threat was particularly acute The construction of a gown in a brown-toned understated print could wow you but the same material done up into a matter-of-fact silk jumpsuit underwhelmed It would have been nice to see Deacon apply more of his attention and artistry to his straightforward looks The designer was at his best here when he pulled out all the stops and anytime he did it was impossible not to be swept up in his storytelling One sight of Elson in that gown and all quibbles were forgotten$$Giorgio Armani continued his 40th-anniversary festivities this afternoon with a press conference and lunch in honor of his new self-titled book of family photographs and personal remembrances The 81-year-old designer was in a celebratory frame of mind even making a joke about his nose I was born with it he said pointing to the baby picture hanging behind him onstage But if the press conference was a moment for reflection and his recently opened museum is the repository for four decades worth of designs today's runway show wasn't the walk down memory lane that might've been expected Instead Armani chose a color little associated with his work red and made it the focus of a collection that was also noteworthy for its lightness a quality that happens to be synonymous with him His notes specified shades of flame lacquer and geranium and more often than not he juxtaposed them with navy icy gray and white Coupled with graphic treatments like woven stripes polka dots and lozenge embroideries the palette gave the show a shipshape clarity quite in contrast to the hazy pastels of the Emporio Armani collection he presented last week Where the Emporio show was awash with pants here he was interested in walking shorts and abbreviated full skirts The trousers he did put on the runway were almost sheer and layered over opaque leggings for a look that was more discreet than seen elsewhere this season (A see-through skirt or two showed off more than he probably bargained for) Tailored one-button jackets in that same filmy material were the best pieces in the collection Though they were rather elaborately stitched with glinting glass beads and silk cord embroidery they too looked airy and weightless a real feat$$Tennis-loving cyborgs are taking over Or rather they did today on the runway at Giulietta where designer Sofia Sizzi imagined the sport and its aesthetics as well as robots through the lens of Courrges sending out an army of mod-looking automotons in punchy crimson cobalt green and white There were sweet cropped off-the-shoulder tops and culottes a great T-shirt dress with a tennis skirt and a kicky blue mini that flashed the crimson of inset pleats Giulietta has been long distinguished by a certain vintage-loving quirk that carries through to silhouettes but this season things took a surprising turn toward the body-conscious strappy bodysuits and hourglasses dresses abounded  Sizzis tennis references were subtly used though they were easy to spot if you knew to look for them bold white stripes seemed to have leapt straight off the courts and onto skirt hems and the legs of pants The lace of a pair of emerald flares was a riff on tennis balls and nets as was the collections lovely closing look a beige evening gown whose organza skirt came studded with big glossy cabochons Robots got a nod in geometric jewel and Plexiglass breastplate-like embellishments But androids arent without their flaws They have no hearts for one And while this collection surely had heart to it in places it felt a little bloodless Giuliettas idiosyncracies have served the label well before heres hoping well see more of them come Fall$$As more than a thousand people traversed the rush hourchoked West Side Highway and flooded onto Pier 26all dressed to the nines (or maybe the threes or twos given the skimpiness of a few notable looks)its fair to say that one of the very last things they were expecting was to be immersed in a contemplative experience Yet this is what they got from Riccardo Tisci on the night he brought his Givenchy show to New York City coinciding with the 14th anniversary of 9/11 There was no all-out gig from Rihanna and Kanye West (as had been the speculation when performances were mentioned) and no inaugural walk from Caitlyn Jenner which had been optimistically rumored given Tiscis strong credentials as fashions first champion of transgender models  Instead with the aid of his coconspirator the artist Marina Abramovic and the cooperation of a staggering sunset across the Hudson Tisci made his show into a meditation on the losses of 9/11 and on slowing things down in our heads perhaps to mourn but also to remember how lucky we are to be alive The audiencethe seated professionals and celebrities and the standing publicwere made to wait and watch for a good hour absorbing the spectacle of blue sky and white and pink-tinted clouds as Abramovics slow-moving performers dressed in white shirts and black pants acted out simple strenuous and repetitive ritualsone with a ladder another with a tree a third with a faucet gushing water Stop Abramovic seemed to be saying Slow down and feel something And meanwhile in the foreground the nonstop parade of personalities kept coming and kept on being photographed and Instagrammed  As far as style is concerned this was also Tiscis opportunity to revisit and refine the ideas hes been working through for his whole career This yearin which a Givenchy store opens in New York Cityis Riccardo Tiscis tenth at the house and there was a serene sense of celebration and coming of age amongst the clothes It was a collection which spelled out and repeated almost-calligraphic black and white variations of the same sentences Ivory slip dresses and rouleau-strapped camisoles with lace edges worn over excellently tailored black pants cut to taper gently over pointed shoes Supple crepe tuxedo jackets with tails soft kimono coats and transparent organdy trenches glimmering with jet embroidery Many many body-skimming sparkly silver shifts Aficionados of Tiscis track record in Paris would also have re-applauded the most spectacular of his couture dressesone with a degrade feather effect and another with leather patches applied on tulle in the shape of alligator skinwhich had never before been shown on live models (as opposed to showroom dummies) And then there was the face decoration taken to the nth degree of freakishly beautiful elaboration in studded golden jewelry tulle frills and lace That calm exposition of skill and taste which surely grows out of nineties memories will stay in the minds of everyone who was on Pier 26 tonight The tragedy of 9/11 can never be overwritten by any fashion showand nor should it bebut at the same time anyone who condemns fashion for concerning itself with current feelings is wrong too$$By now you know what to expect from a Greg Lauren show Vintage military fabrics pieced-together jackets hip-slung trousers and hand-distressing are his brands unwavering signatures Theyre working for him too Before taking their seats a dozen editors and admirers milled around Moynihan Station decked out in his vagabond layers so there was no confusing which stage was his Other labels have begun to embrace a sort of deconstructed nomadic look (Yeezy comes to mind) but Laurens take is less severe than many of his contemporaries Where other shows might have felt provocative and a bit dark Laurens outlook was all about moving forward while honoring the past and inspiring people to think about clothes differently That came through stronger than ever in his Spring presentation which opened with a captivating performance by 10-year-old dancer Lil'Mini Phoenix set to Nick Drakes Way to Blue I saw her dance a couple months ago and knew I wanted her to open my show Lauren said backstage Shes an example of this next generation of strong females who are saying Dont tell me what I should be or aspire to I really believe women are leading the way in creativity leadership artevery discipline Theyre breaking boundaries changing stereotypes How did that sentiment translate into the clothes Laurens women always look powerful in their army drabs and rumpled suits and there were plenty of those here But an expanded evening range gave the designer the chance to inject a little more sex appeal An ivory body-skimming silk gown looked 90s-era minimal at first but there were billowing swaths of parachute fabric spliced into the back I wanted there to be flow he explained There were also subtle dance references like a champagne dress with hand-placed strips of silk on the bodice which mimicked the casual but intentional way a dancer laces up her pointe shoes The final look was Laurens most experiential to date The halter neckline of a fluid jet-black silk dress was sculpted cast in resin and then plated with gunmetal He described it as part relic part liquid metal but on a simple beautiful silhouette It would make an interesting red carpet choice but our moneys also on the silk lounge pants and robe coat which offered a softer spin on the tuxedo$$The incoming march of a new generation in Italy has begun and the fashion world finds itself standing back spectating on the sudden arrival of a multicolored sparkly life-affirming parade Alessandro Michele is in the spotlight as the Pied Piper of changea risk-taker and revolutionary who has not so much wiped the slate clean at Gucci as doodled all over it colored it in stuck sequins on it and tied it up with a grosgrain bow His Spring lineup was a very much amplified filled-in decorated and dazzling accessorized extension of the girly geeky vintage-like collection that he launched last season in the incongruously dark nightclubby surroundings of the show space the company had been using since the 90s when Tom Ford was grooving the disco 70s at the brand As Michele said backstage surrounded by a visual kaleidoscope of glittery flower-embroidered satin chiffon Lurex knits brocades and trimmings Its a big trip Of course I am interested in personal style and quirkiness There are things here that look vintage but dont really exist as vintageits the illusion of it Im not nostalgic Id like to shake it up again Michele is having none of the slick Gucci aesthetic that descended down through the tenure of his predecessor and former boss Frida Giannini This time he led his army of Gucci girls into the open air and constructed an aristo-domestic set with a printed carpet against the backdrop of a disused train depota plot of broken-down old industrial Milan which if we are to be romantic about it seemed something like a metaphor for Italian regeneration  What Michele is doing is certainly very Italian in its references which (if we are to be geeky about history) run the gamut from Missonis Lurex knits to Roberta di Camerino to Walter Albini and generally use the wonderful era of expressively luxe postwar dressmaking fabrics as a playground Michele said he has been thinking about the Renaissance and the 1970sboth great eras for Italy in their own waysbut that his whole point is to express personality and emotion through his clothes Fashion is close to tenderness he declared apologizing for his English I havent slept for two days  No wonder Apart from his sweeping in of a whole new aesthetic the vast variety of components in the collection must have kept Michele and his teamsand the shoe bag hat eyewear and trimmings communities of Italyworking around the clock for months The results are mesmerizing close-up Gucci loafers that get pearl-studded heels damask slip-ons with ridged soccer soles green boots with flared heels and ghillie laces in rococo blue satin a pair of Mary Janes with studs made of bullet casings Thats just for starters If Gucci manages to supply even a fraction of all this stuff to its stores worldwide it could have riotous demands on its hands$$The heritage of Guy Laroche reads blurry at best in our collective consciousness so when London-based designer Adam Andrascik took the reins of the storied house earlier this year it was his turn to write a new set of rules From that first outing it was already clear his vision dramatically overstepped the Parisienne tropes of Monsieur Laroches couture past driving a more youthful urban sensibility that returned in his second collection for Spring  Stretching a tall tale of tropical dystopia to describe his sophomore effort Central Saint Martinstrained Andrascik showed an upbeat cross-section of ladylike daywear collaged with wartime references such as the khaki jacquards traced with palm fronds that occasionally returned as mirrored appliqus for evening Swinging between touches of military detailing and ultra-feminine froufrou his barely there shirting off-the-shoulder jackets and miniskirts benefited from the strictness he employed via brass button symmetry yet faltered into unnecessary complication when ruching and knotted hemlines took center stage  Among the complex slice-and-dice of dvor jacquards and muddy striped separates Andrasciks talent with a biker jacket rose once again to the fore with that Laroche staple energized in multiple permutations today In leather it featured a daring cutout shoulder and chain details (perhaps a sultry choice for Jada Pinkett Smith who sat front row in Falls gold-dipped sweaterdress) yet for Andrascik it seems the more streamlined the better Cases in point a Perfecto lapel folding down a straight double-collar coatdress and a series of scooped-back shirts They channeled that same millennial grunge that his double-waistband denim captured in spades$$The timing couldnt have been better Just as the models streamed out together for Haider Ackermanns finale the clouds broke outside the Palais de Chaillot and sunshine poured in through the giant Eiffel Towerfacing windows lighting up a parade of gorgeous pastel panne velvet Ackermann has a reputation as Pariss broodiest artiste known for a dark moody palette and a penchant for draping that sometimes errs on the droopy side He was up to something a bit different today and it started with his dreamily hued velvetin lemon yellow blush pink pale blue and lilacwith punk-but-pretty mohawks to match Weve seen color play a starring role at other shows this week notably Dries Van Noten and Lanvin but here it was an authentic surprise Its likely nobody walked in wanting a pair of green chartreuse satin pants with a dusty pink and faded blue waistband but some of us walked out that way  The other virtue of this collection was its diversity Jacket-wise Ackermann put a lot of options on the runway from shrunken leather motos to languid mens dressing gowns to a double-breasted blazer trim enough to tuck into trousers Pant styles meanwhile ranged from Friday night at the club (black leathers) to Sunday morning at Les Puces (frayed and patched cargos) Only laser-cut leggings stood out as a mistake in a lineup that was otherwise pretty free of them The lacy pantyhose peeking out from under waistbands was a styling effect strictly runway only Dresses werent the focus but the ones he did show scored high on the wearability meter especially a bias-cut black velvet number worn with a matching jacket$$Everything old is new again at Halston Heritage For Pre-Fall an archival feather hat designed by the late legendary Roy Frowick set the gears turning and for Spring it was a vintage Halston silk scarf in a macro orchid print that inspired creative director Marie Mazelis At todays preview she also namechecked Cuba specifically referring to the candy-colored crumbling splendor captured in photographer Robert Polidoris images of Havana The jetsetting appeal of recent seasonsinspirations have lately included Halstons jaunts to China and Acapulcohas done plenty to increase the glamour quotient at the brand and it did so here too if subtly That orchid scarf led to larger-than-life prints (Halston was known to spend around six figures a year to keep his studio full of his favorite blooms) which were used on blouses and diaphanous caftans The Polidori pictures informed Mazeliss palette of aquamarine coral and tangerine  Movement was central here whether in the accordion-pleated chiffon overlay that topped one simple sheath or the fistfuls of jangling paillettes on the shoulders of another At times it felt like the HH team stuck too literally to the shapes of Halstons seventies salad days with their one-shouldered frocks plunging halter dresses and wide-leg glamour-puss jumpsuits Next season it might be worth adding a bit of that eras gleeful hedonism into the mix$$The woman for whom Hellessy is designed does not wear short shorts said Sylvie Millstein during the presentation of her latest collection and she certainly wont have to Long fluid gowns in striped cotton-linen and ochre-colored silk commingled with easy blush-toned pajama suiting and tuxedo-tailed strapless bodices worn over wide-leg trousers promoting a different kind of cool entirely An off-the-shoulder blouse with a thick black band across the chest and creamy white poet sleeves gathered at the cuffs a light silk trench in that same shade of ochre boasting a literal twist of fabric at the back It was a vision of summer in the city where the frayed hems come on the edges of a boxy tailored T-shirt-style topnot your cutoffs  The presentation took place in Chelsea at Lori Bookstein Fine Art where fate would have it that the current showHiroyuki Hamada Paintings opening September 10served as a kind of underlining to Millsteins aesthetic philosophy an artful approach to a certain elegant restraint Its about not doing too much said the designer who looked to colors found in a city summer and primarily relied on all-natural fibers (linen cotton silkand really what more do you need in the sultriest of seasons) She found her inspiration in the rooftop parties that absorb New Yorkers social lives from June through September with all of the skylines sparkle (here seen in a V-neck cocktail-ready cotton lam shift its Art Deco silhouette echoing the era of some of Manhattans most lauded skyscrapers) and upward thrust (represented by the bold vertical stripe of a column dress and mid-calf-length extended pajama shirt tunic) implied therein$$Fashion history is Hwan Heos obsession The Korean designer has a quite nerdy approach considering his almost scholarly zeal in referencing a precise fashion decade for each collection I call it the Critique Collection Project because the process is close to a research or a study he said during a presentation of his Spring lineup Every Critique Collection is numbered like chapters in a fashion history book He has already reached Critique Collection Project n9 which was dedicated to the Great Depression Not a very lighthearted subject but the designer was undeterred He found a picture from the 30s of a little girl working in a factory imagining her dreaming of being free and playful instead of having to face such a harsh reality Hence a collection where the severe tailoring of masculine workwear (in pursuit of historical truth real cutting patterns of that era were used as references) was softened by the use of fun feminine colors Ribbons and strings added a gentle yet playful touch allowing the outfits to be transformed in a constellation of diverse silhouettes following the personal mood of the wearer In another literal nod to the prohibitions of that time not a bit of fabric was wasted Instead of trimming the excess material the ingenious Hwan Heo made it into a multitude of inventive shapes leaving the ends loose and un-hemmed Case in point was a voluminous coat in black-and-white houndstooth jacquard with an orange belt apparently it was cut as a geometric square but on closer inspection it revealed hidden wings made from uncut fabric folding and cascading on the sides for a graceful ruffled effect$$Trying to describe Herms is an exquisite form of torture to a non-French person Somehow the foreign tongue (I mean English) simply cannot find words to explain the ingeniously crafted superfine fabrics and leather it uses without sounding pretentious (a well-known Anglophone phobia) Even worse the values of the house are so restrained and so coded as to be next to undetectable to the uninitiated Being in on them involves far more than being alert to the occasional H logo on top of a bag strap or congratulating oneself for recognizing that Herms silk scarves are being incorporated into clothing as Nadge Vanhee-Cybulski did (again) this season  In a nutshell Herms is the essence of the cultivated inbred French point of view that if you have wealth it must be spent so that it doesnt show except to those of your class And by the way a woman must never blunder by trying to be sexy appear to wear makeup or have done hair Foreign women are half-blind to all these nuances as they run counter to most of our instincts yet still we are obsessed with cracking the secret codes Both Kris Jenner and Janet Jackson are apparently amongst the intrigued They were onhand at the show to view how Vanhee-Cybulski would set out the Herms principles for Spring  She did it with a simplified sequence of blue-black tailoring and grid-patterned black-on-cream tops and pants and mustard-color dresses in cotton and leather accessorized with large quartz and clear resin cuffs Something of Vanhee-Cybulskis background as a former design director for The Row figures in here Shes brought a sense of relaxed city-sportiness to the picture showing Herms trainers with many looks and dialing back on the horsey heritage for the moment Its not showy fashion that is being sold here more a carefully calibrated sense of a lifestyle which consciously rises above trendiness For those who want to belong to it the quality of the materials will be explained in the ritual of buying at Herms where the quiet mystique of all this Frenchness is fully laid out$$Today was the 30th anniversary of Herv Lger and show-going lovers of the label shuffled in wearing none other than the houses perennial frock the bandage dress The attire was predictable but creative officer Lubov Azria threw onlookers for a loop when it came to the runway There wasnt a bandage dress in sight We were thinking How do we evolve this line on the runway where we didnt do one bandage technique  said Azria backstage Sure the decision not to include the popular body-skimming piece synonymous with the house seemed risky but Azria managed to keep the DNA of Herv Lger alive in other ways First from afar many of the minidresses looked like bandage dresses and moved like bandage dresses (they barely moved at all) Those features were enough to keep the die-hard lovers of the staple happy For instance there were still those hourglass-hugging silhouettes this time seen in jacquard fit-and-flare frocks which came in black and cream with crisscross netting dipping down into the dcolletage But Azria was also able to infuse some new techniques like floral appliqus on tank dresses which nicely traced the body to emphasize the waist There were also some woven cords on a sleeveless dress slightly curved for a slenderizing trompe l'oeil effect  But it was Azrias introduction of trousers on the catwalk (before she had only showed leggings) which provided a true dose of cool Jacquard pants were striped or patterned flaring out at the kneean effect that seemingly elongated the legsor were woven into slouchy or fitted jumpsuits The new direction still contained that bold va va voom factor of a bandage dress but it wasn't as forwardand with it Azria could potentially gain a new set of fans$$To witness a designer evolve improve and flourish is one of the greatest pleasures of regular show attendance Today Holly Fulton hit that career-narrative uplift with a collection that put away some of the childish (albeit diverting) tics she had previously favored for a focused yet imaginatively soaring kaleidoscope of clothing Her inspiration was the artist Eileen Agara name shamefully new to this reviewerwho collaged repetitive patterns taken from nature Hence the calligraphic ruffles on the starfish-studded opening dresses that echoed the languidly spiraling tail of a seahorse Or the injection-molded abstract floral silicon appliqus and glinting Swarovski protoChaos Theory myriads that danced across these carefully proportioned silhouettes Fultons feel for harmonic color combinations was in tune and she paid rewarding diligence to often-overlooked categories that included an exactly precise denim and chambray section Previously Fulton was lovable for the walk-of-shame tousled fiercenessvery Londonthat so often inflected itself in her collections Today that was eclipsed by unapologetic virtuosity Backstage Fulton said We were trying to use repetition to create cohesion that reflected the almost psychedelic eccentricity of Agar My favorite quote from her is Ive enjoyed life and it shows through like a transparent skirtshe basically spent many of her latter years being semi-naked in translucent garmentsand we tried to incorporate that idea of something strong feminine and light$$It was all about childhood in the Caribbean And growing up around uniforms We had such high education and we couldnt do anything with ithigh education and low living quarters So it was about cutting up and altering that school uniform as we did  Shayne Oliver was wearing a long striped knitted column dress as he gave his articulate coda to Hood By Airs radically chopped-up schoolyard collection after a show to which the notes had been printed on a detention card registering many misdemeanors A journalist earnestly asked Oliver for his position on gender-neutral clothes as there had been equal numbers of men and women wearing spliced and suspended skirts and dresses on the runway Which is meant for which To Oliver thats hardly a burning issue anymore At this point he replied patiently we are wearing Hood By Air just as part of the family Its odd how things come around There was a fashion movement in the 90s called deconstructionism which mainly came from then-marginalized and poor young designers who bonded in basements in Antwerp and London In some ways Hood By Air is their 21st-century successor working to take apart conventional garments shrinking the components and making something new and unrecognizable out of them using zippers and the language of bondage paraphernalia Still Hood By Airs collective way of working is different and in many ways more successfully social revolutionary than those who went before many of whom eventually became absorbed into the commercial style of mainstream minimalism For one thing HBAs expression is far more exuberantly sexual fun and democratic than the intellectually exclusive 90s crew For another the HBA ethos is genuinely at the leading edge of a social change that has swept through legislation this year in ways former generations never have dreamed would come to pass And for a third Hood By Air is a brand that actually sells It doesnt look like highfalutin fashion butand this would never have happened before eitherits welcomed as part of Fashion Week recognized as a now-unmissable draw for international buyers and press One up for the credibility of New York fashion$$We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold Thus begins Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas gonzo maestro Hunter S Thompsons ever-entertaining account of how not to be a reliable journalist and the source material for this evenings almost-as-diverting House of Holland show Strictly Holland was inspired by the labor-of-love Johnny Depp flick from 1998 So the sometimes jeweled sometimes embroidered insects that oozed down his clothes were approximations of the hallucinatory special effects mustered for that production while the bulging ostrich feather shoes and appliqus were nods to the abysmal 70s motel decor Depps Thompson bugged out on in the movie  The first look featured a crazily patched field jacket on a model styled to approximate Thompson himself and the bucket hats that ran through the collection were more hat-tips to the reprobate author Head-fry colorful cactus-print shirtdresses nerd-chic pulled-high sports socks queasy abstract jacquards and you-really-shouldn't-mix-those color combinations including lime green and orange added to the maximalist overdose Thompson and Holland although separated by decades and disciplines made for intoxicating bedfellows$$If you can remember them afterwards British music festivals can often be wonderful Trouble is they are almost always extremely wet Forget Burning Man think Soaked Everyone Today Alasdhair Willis evoked these dubious delights by creating a runway of trodden mud on which he relived the three stages of typical Brit Festival experience via the medium of clothes First optimistic anticipation In they bounded wearing ripstop fishtail parkas in sunny dgrad pastels under a deludedly light layer of deconstructed outerwear This included a powerful remix of the trucker jacket in shades of olive and camo The shoes a key category for Hunter included an interesting hybrid of desert boot and the specially-made Vibram sole used on the labels heaviest-duty Wellingtonhere rendered in pastel panels for fashion consumption Next postinevitable downpour came adaptation Rubberized coats peppered with drawstring ringlets and botanical flecked semitransparent parkas wreathed in guy rope ribbons were meant said Willis to give the impression they had been hastily assembled to fend off the rain Wellingtons appeared in more dgrad pastel Camo parkas in crunchy-to-the-touch treated nylon obscured rather unfortunately a fine section of colorful patched gingham shirting By the end sheer abandon had set in Its still raining but Hell Yeah A medley of oversized baseball jackets-meet-ponchos came variously peppered with patches (including the Beatles Yellow Submarine) or with suspended fringes of more ribboning Hunters metamorphosis from farmers favorite to front row draw (Salma Hayek and Luke Evans were among the attendees today) began when Kate Moss Sienna Miller and other It Brits started wearing the companys Wellingtons at Glastonbury a decade or so ago So riffing on that transformative moment seems a fair way to advance Williss ambition to further Hunter as a youthful lifestyle brand Backstage he recalled his own first festival Glastonbury 1985 I saw Echo & the Bunnymen And it didnt rain Some guys have all the luck$$Since debuting his first collection for ICB earlier this year Makoto Takada has carefully cultivated the seeds planted by his predecessor Prabal Gurung As he settles in for his third season as design director Takada is revealing a bit more of his own playful sensibility while still filtering it through the brands working-woman narrative  The starting point for the collection was the photography of Vivian Maier a Chicago nanny who found success posthumously when undeveloped rolls of film shot by her in the 50s through the 70s were discovered and published But instead of riffing on the retro styles seen in her work Takada translated the inspiration into a witty exploration of hidden talent and secret fulfillment Takada liked the idea that Maier who toiled undiscovered for decades didnt need anyones affirmation to value herself So sprinkled through the collection are tiny surprises that only the wearer might notice a structured blazer pleated so that in motion a flash of nude crepe is revealed a pinstripe constructed from raffia and black wool trousers with a sheer grid created using dvor which revealed a minuscule square of skin For the woman who buys this its something she can enjoy just for herself said Takada Shirting remains the brands bread and butter and this seasons pice de rsistance according to Takada is a whimsical take on the classic a blue oxford shirt with a fountain of delicate feathers sprouting from the chest The feathers had been carefully hand-stitched in India so that they would hover over the fabric like a little cloud I had this idea of someone who works in the corporate world showing up in this shirtits in the dress code but also not in the dress code said Takada Its that rebellion and irony It reminds me of how Vivian took photos of regular people but there was always a narrative$$Iceberg has seen a long list of designers come and go over the years Jean-Charles de Castelbajac Marc Jacobs the Dsquared2 brothers and Giambattista Valli have all held the top post Alexis Martial was the most recent recruit until he graduated to Carven earlier this year Now Arthur Arbesser who launched his own label a few seasons ago has assumed the role and its a sign of his buzz factor and Milans growing enthusiasm for nurturing local talent that the turnout in the front row was the best it has been at Iceberg in recent memory I feel quite honored and happy to be here Arbesser said backstage but at the same time I feel [the line] needs a good injection of fun and energy And a clear message He certainly brought zest to the endeavor this afternoon embracing the brands heritage in knits and not skimping on color or pattern either The bonkers work of the Italian artist Enrico Baj was a jumping-off point informing the bold print on a silk dress and the plastic badges pinned to the chest of some pieces creating a loose sort of military vibe But the knits are what really resonated With their preppy-psychedelic sensibility and body-conscious fit theyll be catnip for the street style posse Theyll also be a pleasure to wear which will make them attractive to more restrained types too It will be interesting to see what Arbesser does for Fall when he can really have a go at sweater dressing We expect to see an even bigger crowd at round two$$In the center of Iris van Herpens venue today lying flat on a plinth was the actress Gwendoline Christie The Game of Thrones star remained there motionless for the whole show even as the trio of animatronic trees surrounding her began to move as if they were weaving the soft fishnet-like dress that spread out in a circle around her Quaquaversal is the name Van Herpen gave her new collection It means going off in all directions and backstage she said thats how she approaches her work collaborating with scientists artists biologists and now performers  Van Herpen is one of contemporary fashions few true conceptual thinkers one for whom process is as integral as the finished product Indeed like Hussein Chalayan this season with his disintegrating dresses she asked us to reconsider the very notion of a finished product with her growing one Beyond the performance piece there was much of interest on Van Herpens runway where the designer worked hard to combine craftsmanship and technology She started with sportswear skirts tops a leanly cut little dress It was normal stuff but for the laser-cutting and hand-weaving The silhouettes were pure and simple so the materials could shine and shine they did on crystal-studded chain-link dresses of the Paco Rabanne variety Only here the chain wasnt chain at all but a clear synthetic material that made the crystals look as if they were floating without a tether The most exceptional work came toward the end of the show on a pair of looks as delicate as a fine tracery with so much negative space they were more not there than there Laser-cut fishnet gowns appeared to have been made from a weightless silvery metal With their futuristic aspects these pieces of Van Herpens will be fitting for Christie when she hits the red carpet for her two holiday blockbusters The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 and Star Wars Episode VII This relationship could be very good for both of them$$She will always be a rock chick at heart but its clear that the Iro girl is going placesshe has a real job now for one and so does her guy so they need more daywear options to make it all work Of course theyre most likely to be in a field where slim-cut cropped leather trousers and destroy-chic jeans are the norm When not worn with basic fine-gauge cotton tanks these might be paired with a breezy popover with openwork details or a multicolored pink print only the most daringor laid-backwill don the striped shirts with deliberate mothy perforations during office hours Other pieces especially the jackets will go just about everywhere These included a salt and pepper tweed number with frayed edges and textured wrap jackets in khaki ecru and black with or without sleeves cinched by an obi-inspired belt (For him spring heralds slim-cut suits too) Since its inception Iros biggest star has been the leather bomber in iterations with cool names like the Ashville the Zefir and the Jone The gangs still all here in neutral colors although theyre being upstaged by offerings in silver gold and saffron that with a tunic or printed maxi dress swapped in move easily from the office to a holiday by the beach Speaking of city and shore an ever expanding repertoire of flats presented a number of hybrid ideas from a pointy boot-meets-slide style to a lace-up-as-thong rounding out the offering were gladiator styles and tennis shoes this season with an iridescent finish$$Isa Arfen collections never lack for charm This season though designer Serafina Sama laid it on even thicker than usual Taking her cues from vintage photos of Balinese women 70s-era exoticism and rave culture in the 90s Sama conjured a rather ladylike trip to the tropicsone of the acid variety perhaps Sama wasnt particularly literal with her references The sarong-style wrapping and tops skirts and dresses layered with ruffles were one type of nod to Indonesia the collections copious black-and-white check it turned out was another (Apparently checked textiles are popular in Bali who knew) The 70s homage was more abstract reflected in the airy hothouse-appropriate shapes of button-downs coats and jackets and in the emphasis on olive drab in the palette Samas decision to steer away from styles plainly associated with the 70s was cannythere have been umpteen versions of the safari jacket since that legendary collection by YSL but none like Samas which came A-line shaped and embellished with graphic grosgrain appliqu Nor were there any flares here or for that matter any Isa Arfensignature culottes Samas trouser message this season was crystal clear capris capris capris Rave culture meanwhile was the most abstracted reference of all Mainly it contributed to the mix of as Sama put it poisonous colors in stripes and a silk-screened tropical floral print So far so charming but the collections real grace notes were to be found in its fabrications an Isa Arfen specialty The PVC-coated linen of a printed kimono coat was one standout another was the crispy cotton blend of the checks Sama also made a concerted effort to use materials that looked crushed or crumpled as though theyd been packed into a suitcase That choice helped to give this rather dressy collection its atmosphere of informality Ditto the way Sama layered her ruffles all askew Ditto too the fact that this collection as a whole came off deeply impractical Individual pieces could easily be worked into a womans everyday wardrobe but they seemed aimed more at the woman for whom every day is an adventure A charmed life to be sure$$Isabel Marant pulled together a thumping 80s hip-hop soundtrack for her show today even though the influences on her new collection skewed more North India than South Bronx The Parisian designer has made a name for herself by filtering that elusive French girl cool through a distinctly global lens She was a seasoned traveler from an early age thanks to her bohemian upbringing and has a knack for cherry-picking and then deftly reconfiguring dress codes and traditions from all four corners of the planet For Spring Marants divining stick led her to the rich colorful textiles of Rajasthan Its a place the designer has visited for inspiration in the past but given the free-spirited eccentric 70s moods that seems to be lingering in the air on the runways that milieu still feels relevant That being said the silhouettes recalled the rounded billowy shapes of the 80s overall Style-conscious festival girls who have spent the summer in breezy vintage-inspired peasant blouses will be swapping out their skinny jeans for harem pants come spring if Marant has her way The MC Hammer favorite isnt exactly the easiest look to pull off but in this case the styling was right Layered up with sequined leggings and elevated with Gorky-style heels the look took on a new vibe What with all the sparkling textiles that have been around in the collections somehow a Lurex gold jumpsuit gathered at the ankle rolled down to the waist and worn with a lightweight sweater felt right for now The global nomad hand of the clothes might have been familiar territory for Marant but its still likely to give her fans a reason to revisit her store$$The pulsing strains of Die Antwoord reverberated through Issas London show space today the first indication that creative director Jamie OHare was looking at his nature girl through a somewhat twisted lens for Spring only his second runway outing for the label Name-checking films like District 9 and Tron backstage he described the blown-up details lavished across cocktail dresses and Resort separates as both futuristic and organican altogether chilly segue for a brand built on graphic eveningwear yet one he tempers with swathes of delicate texture and shine A slew of opening looks paired flat planes of white silk crepe against an encrusted latticework of metallic embroidery transforming the designers abstract research of stem cell structures into glistening cocktail fare Later body-con knits came tiered in black and white bands of lacing and plastic eyelets creating eye-catching frills and multilayered contours that hugged in all the right places Balancing that stricter offering flattering tank dresses fell into handkerchief hems that matched the delicate butterfly effect of lace jersey caftans in cerulean and optic white fractalstheir swirling architectural prints later morphing into an unfortunate trippy tie-dye that slowed the momentum of an otherwise appealing minimalist streak It preceded the monotony of slinky wrap dresses that followeddraped concoctions in sheer self-stripe silk space doughnut prints and bands of aquarelles that will slip easily into the summer party circuit though with little fanfare Pieces like Lily Donaldsons floor-length gown however (its circuit of jacquard trailed with white lozenges) spoke a little louder of Issas raison dtre no-nonsense glamour with a bold feminine allure$$Issey Miyakestyle micro-pleats have been experiencing a runway renaissance of late One place you wont find a straightforward take on the house signature though is at Issey Miyake itself At the brands show designer Yoshiyuki Miyamae continued to test the horizons of what a pleat can be and do introducing a new baked stretch technique that molds pleats into the body of a fabric The most compelling looks in the collection were the ones that featured wavy baked stretch pleats with contrasting colors printed into the curves as the sculptural garments moved they had a spring action a little like that of a Slinky The motion was surprising but subtleyou could easily imagine wearing these pieces The looks with the most instantaneous appeal however were the bright color-blocked ones punctuated with touches of fringe Miyamae and his team had a tropical theme going here witnessed in the collections palette but the raffia textures of the fringed pieces nicely underlined the hothouse atmosphere There were also net tops with a similarly earthy charman unusual tone for Miyake a house that hews to a synthetic aesthetic as a rule but a welcome addition to the brand vocabulary Pleats remain the star at Issey Miyake but there are new supporting players$$The vintage Levis revival currently under way has got premium denim-makers in a bit of a pickle Do you try to propose an alternative look or offer new jeans that accord with the vintage vibe J Brand did a bit of both this season in a collection of denim and ready-to-wear that emphasized time-tested silhouettes Most of the innovation was in the materials Head of design Mary Bruno did yeomans work developing ultra-lightweight denims and dyeing and distressing  gossamer cotton-linen blends to look like denim such that J Brand may indeed find itself with a monopoly on jeans suitable for the dog days of summer Brunos other key proposals were to offer a trouser jean which looked particularly natty in optical white and indigo-dyed stretch denim made in vaguely 70s-ish swimwear shapes She wasnt trying to reset anyones denim agenda here this collection was more about proposing solutions for women who want to keep wearing the denim they already like when it gets really hot Thats enough to make a market not so much to make news$$You could call it London Fashion Weeks soft launch J JS LeeJackie Lee to her friendshas the advantage of showing first on the London calendar She is South Korean and emerged from Central Saint Martins MA course in 2010the minimalist yearwith a bumper crop of alumni who founded their own businesses in London Simone Rocha Thomas Tait and Matthew Harding of Palmer//Harding were all in the same class taught by the late legendary professor Louise Wilson Lee has taken her collection away from its beginnings in rather structured tailoring in neutral colors toward something more fluid and airy withsurprisepops of color bold stripes and a few dappled black-and-white prints The result a pleasantly breezy wardrobe that could translate well as daily wear in those cities that are baking in high summernot London particularlybut then again Lee is from Seoul$$The J Mendel customer has long been a certain type of Madison Avenue grande dame one who comes for the furs from the incomparable atelier and sticks around for the romantic frocks to tuck under them But the designers recent red carpet successes with a younger crowdTaylor Swift Maria Sharapova and the Sports Illustrated model Hannah Davis among themhave opened up a new demographic one just as attuned to major red carpet moments as self-styled Instagram snaps And who can blame Giles Mendel for wanting to be there for both The day looks he had designed for Spring seemed crafted with this crew in mind with urban-minded accents such as graphic prints grommets straps and slits Asymmetrical micro-pleated skirts were either made micro-length or cut to the ankle paired with roomy tunics or boxy tees In what felt like a more-is-more take on what the kids are wearing bandeau tops were paired with snakeskin wrap skirts or light-as-air organza ballroom styles that while masterfully renderedThe pleats open up and blossom like petals said Mendel and they didultimately missed the mark (Skin may be in and snakeskin too but the kids who love you for old-school romance wont necessarily love you for their going-out-clubbing looks) As the glamour level rose things loosened up A narrow micro-pleated column dress with a built-in bandeau had massive appeal on and off the hanger while a black-and-white abstract-print silk chiffon gown with cutout bodice was its own wind machine moving with extreme graceit could be just the thing for next awards season A creamy textured silk crepe anorak patterned with graphic black abstractions inspired by Japanese woodblock prints hit just the right note charmingly sporty even when paired with a matching intarsia cropped mink that Mendel explained was intended to disappear into the pattern when popped on top And as for those furs a pair of long vividly patterned yagasuri intarsia mink vests For the plane Mendel said with a winkwill prove just the thing to tide over the J Mendel client old and new until fall when the big coats come out$$For a brand in times of transition figuring out the best way to trigger the reset button is often the most pressing challenge Thats perhaps why this season JCrew was going back to its roots or as president and executive creative director Jenna Lyons put it Pulling from the things that feel undeniably like us Gingham nautical stripes tomboy favorites such as the shrunken military jacket Its easy to distinguish the moving parts to the JCrew look one that Lyons herself has made so appealing to women the world over in the last decade All those classics made an appearance in the presentation today only often they were tweaked in subtle ways One sun-bleached menswear-inspired plaid shirt was paired with a matching bias-cut skirt that was covered in glittering sequins while another was recast as an off-the-shoulder peasant blousewhat is fast becoming the answer to the crisp white button-down The brands knack for preppy print-on-print combos came through particularly well in a graphic blue-on-blue gingham shirt and pants ensemble With new womenswear designer Somsack Sikhounmuong set to make his official debut next season it will be interesting to see which way those familiar JCrewisms will go$$Gargantuan 80s leg-of-mutton sleeves Galactic knitted pantsuits Ruched body-con dresses Keith HaringcumVivienne Westwood squiggle prints Gold metal chokers Square-toed metallic spike heels of the kind that havent been seen since the 90s Lets put it this way There is a lot to process at JWAnderson A womans odyssey was what Jonathan Anderson was calling it backstage The idea that if you took a date in time and sliced it through and looked at what everyone was doing at that timewould it mean anything And would it matter if it didnt But lets shelve the intellectual parsing of that complicated quote for a moment Perhaps only Anderson knows what it means and it doesnt matter if we never do But to state it plainly from another angle the thing about Anderson at this very moment is that he is someone possessed of the ability to jumble together unexpected ideas and make a new sentence of them It is the sentence that reads You didnt know you wanted this beforebut now you will That of course is the essence of fashionsomething that makes you feel a bit queasy and puzzled for a few seconds but then just as quickly shoots into the bloodstream as desire Jonathan Anderson classifies as an experimental avant-garde designer in that sense a leader But at another just as crucial level hes a clear-headed maker of product Break down this collection and its full of items to take away just as they are many ribbed knits as tunics and pants neat pantsuits in compact jersey fluid printed midi skirts a frill-fronted A-line dress and a tracksuit covered in net Then bags worn two at a time cross-body like panniers But back to what the man said A clue was in the audioa mix of Fran Lebowitzs words about Andy Warhol and his manipulation of fame and Rihannas Only Girl (In the World) I was watching Martin Scorseses documentary about Fran Lebowitz and liked what she said her commentary on a moment She spoke about creativity What does it mean Maybe it only means something to me said Anderson Then he paused and shrugged as if something Lebowitz said chimed with him on the level of being a designer in an industry that is constantly running at high speed and of course whose work is instantly exposed at every turn Obviously he said Theres always another show Not that he should worry about that today This was a moment that is certain to keep people talkingand buying their Spring trophies for plenty of time to come$$A gigantic red ball of fabric was pushed across an open expanse of concrete floor by a tiny barefoot child in a mans white shirt Models walking in ones and twos followed him dressed in fractured tailored pieces sliced half-jackets in navy and gray cloth dresses overlaid and underlaid with white shirts cut on the diagonal or worn back-to-front and tied on with cotton tape Halfway through the show to add to the oddness the designer himself appeared seemingly an adult version of the boy leading a white horse across the stage in an interlude before more models came on What was this A surreal symbolic dream or a fashion nightmare where clothes are to be bought in asymmetrical fractions Backstage Simon Porte Jacquemus who recently won an LVMH Prize in its young designer competition tried to explain the state of mind he was in when he plotted this oddly trancelike and unsettling parade His emotions seemed raw and vulnerable The collection was called Le Nez Rouge he said because he had been sick afflicted with a red nose and personal troubles as he was designing You know my collections are normally about the South of France and the beach and happy things Well now the Jacquemus girl is not smiling he said Without spelling out what had happened he added My friends my family knows It is harsh to call judgment on a very young designer who is clearly under stressas are they allas he tries to make his way with feeling in the hard world of fashion commerce Though his narrative held in a huge arena of a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris didnt quite hold up in the space it didnt obfuscate everything Jacquemus has going for him Backstage his navy pants long narrow skirts and white shirts looked crisply cut and as attractive as they always do in stores$$With his recent turn toward tailoring and a more minimalist point of view its easy to forget that Jason Wu got his start as a dressmaker This season he seemed eager to remind us of his origins Glamour was the one-word description his show notes proffered The first look out was a trenchcoat sure but its edges were softly frayed and its storm flap was ruffled Ruffles were the big story Cascading down the sides of a halter dress in a bright blurry floral print and fluttering at the neckline of the shows best look a gorgeous coral pink cocktail number they evoked Yves Saint Laurent Even a python-skin dress got the flounce treatment Here and there on the shoulders of a blouse and the sides of a somewhat too-stiff woven raffia dress those frills got the better of him Hes no YSL (heck probably not even Saint Laurent himself could live up to his legend now) but Wus output continues to mature The work that went into the bodices of a camisole and a T-shirt dress among other pieces was so intricate it looked more like a print than a patchwork of five different kinds of lace Otherwise there was a healthy amount of the sportswear hes come to favor lately Wu's tailoring is confident and a pair of black suits with delicate lace underpinnings looked great with flat strappy sandals Also tempting clingy knits in a mlange tweed for day and for evening in fine-ribbed silk with more of that saucy fraying$$Jean-Pierre Braganza invited some serious toe-tapping this afternoon in London The British-born Canadian designer spent his summer between the research rooms of the British Library and the blank canvas of his studio listening to jazz greats from Charles Mingus to John Coltrane But their freewheeling musical influence found its form not in the brightly-lit looks that made their way down the runway but in Braganzas improvisational approach to designing them I never liked jazz when I was growing up he said backstage But now the fact that its so structured and yet so chaotic really fascinates me That frenetic spirit translated into endless draping and deconstruction Hems were left undone and suits were radically reconfigured with entire panels left to hang loose This may all sound wildly experimental but in fact these clothes will do nothing to alienate Braganzas eternal muse that all-powerful female who on this front row lineup was embodied by the spiral-curled British songstress Ella Eyre The show found its headiest form in digital print dresses that drew on the visual style of the Bauhaus But come next spring the real standouts will be the series of white zip-skirted coats and crepe trench coats worn over diaphanous duchesse satin dresses All were subtle understated and executed with a lighter-than-air finesse As an aside there was a message in the fact that Braganza had eschewed his usually extensive show notes this time around You guys are going to hate me he said with a smile to the gaggle of journalists waiting backstage I want you to use your cerebral abilities to see the story for yourselves  Well perhaps because of the show's title Whiplashed which was taken from the Oscar-winning Miles Teller movie (tap tap tap) there's one word that immediately springs to mind upbeat$$Click through Jenny Packhams past 10 or so collections and youll notice a common theme Each one opened with an embellished dress So when the first look at todays show was a black and red floral-printed suit you had to wonder how Packham got there When she rattled off a few of her favorite musicians backstageMick Jagger Nick Cave and David Bowieit all started to make sense Packham was inspired by rock n roll legends who resisted gender strictures and werent afraid to indulge the more feminine aspects of their personalities Packham herself was dressed in an oversize blazer cropped pants and creeper brogues After decades in business it was only a matter of time before she started taking a page from her own personal style While the new emphasis on day-to-night dressing was promising the androgynous concept didnt quite translate for many of the looks The suits were a bit too boxy and Packhams clientele relies on her for glitzy embellishments not wildflower prints Perhaps it was just muscle memory but the glittering red carpetworthy dresses were the ones that stood out Consider Packhams most visible customer Kate Middleton Youd be hard-pressed to get her in a mannish blazer but the jade georgette gown with draping at the hip would work perfectly$$This is your brain This is your brain on screens If Jeremy Scotts latest collection had a subtextand its not clear that it didit was that our brains are going a little screwy due to overexposure to screens Check out the insane-looking cartoon faces on Scotts new intarsia knits Isnt that kind of how your mind feels after several consecutive hours of binge-watching UnREAL while simultaneously answering emails on your laptop and glossing Instagram on your phone Anyway The screen thing was very much an ur-text of Scotts latest effort with its digital television prints and trippy sweaters knit to look the way old television screens did when they went a little wonky That was all part of Scotts larger theme which was an homage to sixties era B-movies and sci-fi that he interpreted with his typical heaping of club-kid flash The eras tropes were rehearsed in everything from abbreviated A-line silhouettes to ray-gun prints to the paillette mesh that was an overt tip-of-the-hat to Cardin As usual Scott seemed to be having more fun making fashion than anyone else on the scene these days but the lineups buoyant tone didnt disguise the fact that this was a pretty disciplined collection The mens looks were eye-popping but they hewed to classic shapesguys with some daring in the fashion department might be swayed by a button down in Scotts scribble print or a leather biker spotted with white polka dots Lots of the womens looks meanwhile could appeal to customers outside the Jeremy cult to wit the tulle pieces with high-contrast sequin stripes or summery short sheaths covered in the scribble or raygun prints A cocktail dress black on top with a ribbon at the waist and a bouffant pink and silver brocade skirt was downright homecoming queen mainstream Scotts rigor was also demonstrated in his materials and his technique The paillettes on the opening look worn by Gigi Hadid for instance were bordered by seed pearl embroidery And Scotts deftness with textiles was witnessed best in the very simplest of his ensembles a matching cropped sweater and miniskirt set down in a cool spongy knit Nothing looked tossed-off here in other words just as nothing looked really truly nuts Scotts experience at Moschino seems to have convinced him theres some fun to be had too in selling tons of clothes$$Shes not too pretty but dressed well That was Ji Ohs summation of her Spring woman who had a kind of haphazard jolie laide and faintly aggressive quality The designers muse was tough and her presentation backdrop was a construction sitelike mishmash of signage Despite the streetwise jumping-off point the clothes bore all the hallmarks of Ohs signature pared-back polish Basics with a twist are the labels bread and butter (landing the line in doors like Barneys Harvey Nichols and Intermix) and this season offered them up in spades There were pinstriped jumpsuits and a plunging silk slip dress a cropped cowl-neck sweatshirt and easy wide-leg trousers Change is incremental in Ohs world of modern staples This season an eye for utilitarian hardware (snaps and zippers and buttons oh my) and a somber palette grounded in navy and white lent things a more androgynous edge in contrast to the punched-up reds cobalt and metallic silver of seasons gone by The real news here was denim It was the first time Oh had taken on the textile and she whipped a single wash into contrasting patch-pocket jackets (using the reverse) pull-on trousers skinny jeans and more Dressed well indeed$$Its no secret that Jil Sander Navy knows its way around a clean pattern But this season the labels variations on layering added a kick of cool to what could otherwise have been a buy-it-anywhere basic Silhouettes were enhanced by skirts and shirts with peplums (not the teeny-bopping out-to-brunch kind but rather smarterwith texture) that mushroomed out from under button-ups to create volume and a cinched waist There were also puffed ruffles which made for a pepped-up take on sleeves and pointed hems on skirts that resembled a mans waistcoat References to Henri Matisses cutouts came in jagged floral patterns that covered shirt and tank dresses in blue and white as well as in hot pink and citrus orange In a nod to Piet Mondrian a perforated shirt and tank dress were tiered into green yellow and blue primary colorsa well-suited complement to the classic linear silhouettes But it was the riff on athleticwear that turned basics into must-haves Dresses were reminiscent of deconstructed parkas fastened with horizontal elastic cording that cleverly created curves A white skirt in the same outerwear style had a strip of fabric that acted like a belt creating an unfinished empire waist that elegantly tufted out above the hipsa piece that could easily become a closet staple or a street style standout$$Disciplined Rigorous Precise Google Jil Sander and those three adjectives come up more than any others Fashion at this moment is moving in a different direction Spring is looking decidedly deshabille Whats Rodolfo Paglialunga installed at Jil Sander one year ago to do Remain faithful to the house codes even as memories of the founder grow fuzzy Go with the current flow Its a conundrum that all designers charged with heading up old labels must face After a couple runway shows that hewed to Sanders clean lines Paglialunga tried option two  An otherwise straightforward two-button blazer was sliced at the shoulder seams another jacket was cut away in the back and a third was deconstructed to look more like a pinafore than your standard double-breasted fare but the tailoring wasnt so radical as to be alienating The Sander-classic crisp white shirt got a revamp too in crinkly slinky sky blue silk with an au courant cutout at the midriff Rounding things out were the sort of slip dresses and wispy bits of silk that have been multiplying on other runways this season Straps spilled off shoulders and asymmetric necklines dipped to reveal the upper arm Cutouts proliferated not just at the waist but near the hem of a sheath or sliced vertically front and back on looser-fitting dresses Paglialunga is a talented guy but this collection gave you a twinge of the familiar It made you miss Sanders hard edges a bit$$Jill Stuart designs wearable hyper-feminine clothes with a woman in mind rather than a particular reference point From the first look it was clear Spring was all about an exuberant hip-shaking party girl There were yards of flowing satin from a languid slip to the designers new take on the voluminous high-neck blouse thats still trending right now It was easy to envision Studio 54 when a pair of superwide flares hit the runway but Stuart wasnt really that focused on the past I think this is just how girls are dressing today she explained backstage She used adjectives like vibrant dancy and magneticthe same words you could use to describe Solange Knowles who was sitting in the front row Stuarts following is a loyal one so the suede skirts and tiered floral gowns will no doubt generate long wish lists But a few of the pieces wont be as easy to pull off like high-rise satin culottes that spotlight your hips or a truly miniature ruffled bandeau The best looks emphasized texture but would still flatter a wide range of women like a shimmery ankle-length floral dress with a cropped sweater layered on top$$Bill Gaytten indulged in some Anglophilia at his John Galliano show this evening His was a gloss on the contradictions of British 20th-century style rather than a straightforward homage to any particular erathere was for instance a hint of a country gentleman out for a shooting weekend in Gayttens checked tailoring and meanwhile more than a hint of the punks who sneered at such men in his looks embellished with safety pins and studs  Rave-era anoraks and dress-for-dinner frock-coats also got a look-in on the Galliano runway But the standouts in this collection were indubitably Gayttens frothy dresses These came in various romantic barely there versions some bedazzled in sequins others paneled in lace and still more boasting tiers of demure ruffles The most eye-catching though were Gayttens polka-dot numbersthe graphic black-on-white pattern made for a nice counterpoint to the looks diaphanous cuts They seemed well suited to some modern-day Lady Mary of Downton famealthough the Lady Marys of today would likely be inclined to throw Gayttens spongy dun-color parka on over that dress before heading out for the evening British style is nothing if not eclectic Gaytten captured that quality well$$We like to think of ourselves as a coastal brand says Rachel Wilder-Hill the vintage-obsessed designer behind Joies easy breezy designspieces she says balance LAs laid-back bohemian side with a touch of Parisian chic As the great divide between high fashion and real women remains very present collections like Joie are becoming more relevant than ever thanks to their ability to tap into the little comfortable luxuries that women of all ages want to wear without the forage of vintage shopping nor the conceptual trappings that can often plague runway brands Its the little details that set us apart continues Wilder-Hill explaining the floral print on a braided silk slip dress This motif came from a scrap of wallpaper I found at a Paris flea market and had repainted by our incredible in-house artist While Joie began as a jeans brand in 2001 its evident that denim has taken a backseat to the expansive range of sundresses floaty shirting and peasant blouses that emphasize soft cotton fabrications for

Some of the prettiest looks within the Spring lineup feature inserts of Victorian-inspired lacework their delicacy balanced by stonewashed denim or light suede keeping their historical leanings within Joies contemporary feminine frame$$In a light-drenched tent at noon on a sunny Sunday Jonathan Saunders set out to show his audience his true colorsas a designer of effortless breezy sensuous clothes Most of the collection was spun out of the success hes had with a certain bias-cut slip-dress design of a few seasons agoits paneled structure lends itself ideally to color-blocking and to matching and clashing prints that can be continually switched up So yes there was a lot of that in his Spring show but he also noted that it was the attitude of the bias cut he was trying to transmit by using trailing ribbon ties and shapes like wrap-over blouses and bathrobe coats Essentially of course Saunders is a colorist and print and pattern specialist of long standing in London and having acquired a new investor this showwith its expensively purpose-built venuerepresents a turn of the page on the business front He has acquired a new CEO and employees which he says is freeing him up to concentrate on being creative and on the detail of luxury finishings on the inside of his clothes Thats all good news for his following of grown-up women in the business political art and fashion worlds$$I think that women come to me when they want to get dressed up and feel strong said Jonathan Simkhai before his Spring 2016 show This collection proved that they could feel romantic too Technical lace embroidered macram and bonded burnout were rendered into figure-hugging cocktail frocks inspired by the tropes city-dwellers overlook every dayskyscrapers subway grates and scaffolding But it wasnt purely urban-minded The designer had spent several weeks this summer in Lake Como researching fabrics and developing a taste for country life as evidenced most winningly by the loosened-up cotton voile dress worn with low-top white sneakers (and less convincingly in a pair of embroidered basketball shorts) I think its one of those grass-is-greener things said Simkhai referring to the seasonal exodus of Manhattanites who repair to various country escapes during the warmer months Youre here and you want to be there or youre there and want to be here His idea seemed to be that with enough flounce and a little wiggle room (the type not necessarily encouraged by an embroidered macram trumpet skirt) one can manage both Simkhai a 2015 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist has developed a following for his figure-skimming silhouettes among those who vote with their Instagram likesbright young and often photographed things like DJ Mia Moretti who provided the shows soundtrack and model

and a female she said Almost uniquely this is a subject upon which fashion can be more explicit than words for clothes are our most potent codifiers of gender But lets try and keep up We started with classically-for-Joseph neutral menswear-touched womenswear Monochrome T-shirts skirts and sweats both held together and defined by twist and turn There were plenty of unexpected rips and twists whorls of construction There were bengal stripe versus pencil stripe viscose silk shirtdresses and skirts plus the odd drop of conventional feminized suiting teamed with sheer tailored mens shirts with girlishly ribboned cuffs Then a shot of acid yellow and patent shine black leather signaled what Trotter saw as a break phase in the narrative from girl dressed as boy toand please bear with me heregirl dressed as boy dressed like girl This allowed Trotter to blend pretty gleaming vintage brocades into monkish military-touched pieces trailed by nylon webbingthis second movements equivalent to the knots and bows wed just seen in the first Her expression of this mood became less gilded and more repressedyou know manlyuntil a last look that took us back near full-circle to the first To see some of the still-shifting ground Trotter was attempting to survey here see the Fall collections from Gucci or Craig Green As an overviewand a point of viewthis Joseph collection was both dizzying and fascinating$$For Fall Josie Natori mined Istanbul for inspiration For Spring she trained her eye a little farther east The whole collection is inspired by Asian painting said the designer at todays presentationher first eveningwear-only outing Natori said she was fascinated by calligraphy and wanted to experiment with brushstrokes To that end an asymmetrical dress featured a straightforward black-and-white brushstroke but Natori also used crystal embellishments to create the same effect on a white column dress and a black basket-weave gown (one of the strongest looks) You really cant go wrong with black and white she remarked dressed in a chic black shift dress But color wasnt off the table entirely The designer honored the season by playing with vibrant slightly off-kilter color combinations An expertly tailored fuchsia strapless tunic layered over orange stovepipe pants was a memorable look Some of the kimono-inspired ensembles verged on being too literal but Natori hit her stride when she incorporated elements of the traditional garb in subtler ways as in the case of a pea green raw silk strapless number with an embellished obi-inspired neckline That said Natori almost shyly is one of my favorites$$Fashion shows with all of their required hustle and flow can actually prove to be something of an obstacle for smaller design houses as the average Fashion Week affair has become more like a performance piece (or a gesture of how much money a given brand has the ability to shell out) and less about its actual purpose which is you know to show the clothes Environmental worries (seating charts The music The lights The lack of heat The oppressive heat The location) are the immediate concerns and the details of a given collection often get lost in the shuffle So when it came to his Spring 2016 show Juan Carlos Obando wasnt taking any chances I want you to turn this jacket inside out he said at one of many private appointments he is holding today in a small space near Saint-Germain proffering a cropped waxed organza version with generous bell sleeves Look at what weve done The piece felt as smooth and as light as cotton and yes the details (stitches seams lines) were perfect This perfection is a sticking point with Obando who has leaned hard into the technical aspects of his manufacturing this season Hes employed exclusive Italian mills hes hired more hands on deck to supervise the construction Count the stitches I am so proud of these details he said highlighting the bias-cut trim of a silk tank top the corners at the edge of a scarf tie I never want to be a brand that looks or feels cheap I hear enough from my friends about how clothes look one way on Instagram and then entirely another in a store And as Obando has realized the chasm between an Instagram like and an actual purchase lies in the physical here and now How does it feel how does it look and most important is it worth it Obando launched with Neiman Marcus and Net-a-Porter last season and a plethora of trunk shows has made him increasingly aware of what women want less gowns more separates Things that can be worn to work and then adjusted (either by adding a skirt or a heel) for evening engagements Comfort a sense of romance a hint at a vibrant inner life Its not about an impossible inspirational womanits about how the clothes make them feel he said in what has become a bit of a refrain among designers this season These were elegant easy looks based around decadently heavy silk separates (those Italian mills) like a camisole with a tie-waist and furls of fabric below the shoulders (the addition of a skirt slit on the bias turns it red-carpet-ready) a slip dress that loops and ties around the wrists striped fishermans pants (those perfect seams again) Deceptively simple pieces were worked with subtle details shirtdresses with scarf-tied necklines that trail behind you as you walk a column skirt slit in the front and back to move like trousers with the stitching (the yarn the same as those used in baseballs the designers nod to a recent trip to Cuba) picked out Its about courtship Obando said Im obsessed with courtshipthe whole thing my designs seeing them on a hanger in the store trying it on I am courting the women trying to convince them to fall in love Judging by these clothes hes going to have a very full dance card come spring$$Its probably been a while since youve wornor thought aboutJuicy Couture But after years of bad news for the brand a glimpse at its Spring collection reveals that business is boomingjust probably not where you live There arent any Juicy stores left in the United States but China has nearly 100 Los Angeles and Dallas are important cities for Juicy too but its clear that the real money is way east As such it was admittedly difficult to parse the sprawling Spring lineup since it was designed with a different market in mind The collection was separated into several delivery groups each one driven by an of-the-moment trend There were boho florals a longtime Juicy signature as well as graphic 80s-inspired logo tees and neon tweed jackets which felt vaguely reminiscent of Jeremy Scotts recent collections for Moschino Here in New York designers have been embracing a more natural crafty approach to dressing but Juicy was all about the opposite bright colors short hemlines and graphic prints Still there were a few straightforward well-constructed pieces that would fit into even the most edited wardrobes like the crisp ponte jackets high-rise flared jeans and foulard-print pants which read like elevated pajamas As for Juicys infamous velour track suits theyre still aroundthey even inspired Juicy Sport a brand-new equally colorful new label of athletic wear$$This was the 10th Paris womenswear show in the cutely unique Julien David narrative His is a label conceived in France but entirely manufactured in Japan where he lived for a decade Seven years after launching he has 100 stockists and says that 40 percent of his sales hail from the country in which his clothes are made So it seemed right and proper that todays collection was a gentle exploration of the similarities and differences between his two home nations The differences were articulated most clearly in his contrasting  use of sunflower and cherry blossom prints or workwear-lean jackets and carpenter coats and pants The panniers on asymmetrical-pleat skirts could have been sourced from Marie Antoinettes wedding dress or Diors Bar suit and servedif you stretched it a bitto produce a Gallic version of the ornamental exaggeration ohashori There was plenty of denimin dungaree dresses more carpenter coats topstitched jeans and appealingly curve-leg four-button pants Nmes France is where legend has it this most ubiquitous cotton twill originated and despite the role of North American teenage culture in ubiquitizing denim it is (arguably) Japan where some of todays finest quality is milled Davids is from Okayama Vinyl laminated over embroidery on elastic-cinched flute-hipped T-shirts fleur-de-lis fil coupes undone Brigitte Bardot bustiers as outerwear and resin-backed cotton crop tops were among the further passing pleasures here The soundtrack was a willfully strange collision of Needle in the Hay and Brush Your Teeth while the mustachioed gentleman on a silk jacquard romper worn beneath a full black skirt and bustier was Henri the designers grandfather This was Jean de Florette meets Swept Away marinated in Davids personal preoccupations Together these ingredients made for an interesting and quietly progressive pot-au-feu Or nikujaga$$There were whoops and cheers even before the crowd caught sight of the first look at todays Julien Macdonald show held at the centuries-old Smithfield Market In a fashion world where trends rotate on an ever faster axis theres something comforting about a designer who holds fast to familiar terraineven when thats as revealing as the spangly flapper-age dress that opened proceedings Though you wouldnt have guessed it until a ways through this mammoth 52-look collection this past summer Macdonald traded the club podiums of the Balearic Isles for the black-sanded beaches of Bali I properly chilled out for the first time in my life he said post-show There was so much inspiration to be found in the tranquility and raw natural beautyand all the traditional textiles  When Macdonald started sketching out Spring 2016 it was these Balinese batiks that he drew on They provided the collections biggest moment the designers main-line menswear debut Tropical prints showed up on beach-y tunic tops and silk shorts that Macdonald says he has been trying to get around to creating for the past 20 years But I didnt want to just do camp menswear he said counting Puff Daddy and Kanye West amongst those whod have a taste for this kind of directional dressing Yet Macdonald being Macdonald he couldnt resist adding sparkles even here Forget the finale gowns and the intricately woven web knits that remained his mainstayin the mind of this Welshman its always going to be all about the rhinestones even for the boys$$Junya Watanabe set his show in the National Museum of Immigration History in Paris an immense Art Deco place built to celebrate the cultural benefits of French colonialism when that sort of thing was thought to accrue to the glory of the republic On the way in guests passed a piece of contemporary art which gave some people pause a wooden boat filled to heaving point with bundles wrapped in African fabric It took but a small leap to associate that with another scene at Dismaland where Banksy's boats filled with miniature models of immigrants floated on a disused Weston-super-Mare holiday pond  An uncomfortable choice of surroundings then for Watanabe to show us a collection themed around African fabric patterns on a cast of white models whose faces were decorated with pale fleshcolor globules mimicking tribal scarification marks It was hard to know which way to react Watanabe is as known for his quiet pacifism and his silent rebellious streak as he is for never giving explanatory quotes Was it a commentary on fashion's long record of annexing the dress art and religious artifacts of other peoples Should he be criticized for doing that And how does he view that from Tokyo living in a country whose culture is constantly appropriated by Western fashion (as seen only this week in John Galliano's geisha-themed show) Anyway There was no denying the anxiety of watching Watanabe's show through the prism of all these contextual and moral questions A pity because at the beginning there was a clear view to beautiful loose smocks and shirtdresses some with draped belled sleeves and semi-sheer fabrics some of which involved black matte lace constructed in a pattern which merged a sense of camouflage with animal pattern After that came two looks with a knitted tiger amid leopard pelts thrown over the shoulders as wraps also great No doubt the African wax-print looks which followed will be prove as easy and commercial summerwear in stores but at the same time they will leave some feeling uneasy$$When presented with the opportunity from the WCFDA (an initiative from the CFDA and W Hotels) to take a research trip rather than going abroad Kaelen Haworth struck out on an all-American road trip Stopping in New Orleans as well as Austin Marfa and Dallas Texas the designer was struck by the various landscapes particularly the harshness and graphic appeal of the desert And so came a collection sparer and more sophisticated than some of seasons gone by Shapes skewed toward a certain utility even at the dressiest A floor-skimming T-shirt dress was boxy and came with patch pockets though its generous slit and fantastic chartreuse hue added plenty in the way of appeal Likewise the versatility of a sleeveless jumpsuit in elephant-gray suede didnt need to be explainedit fairly cried out to be teamed with your everyday kicks or sky-high wedges and a clutch Haworth continued last seasons explorations with knitwear and while you wont find much in the way of the slouchy or the oversize her clingy ribbed knits are top-notch The sparseness of these pieces was a promising development for the label still it wasnt all minimalism and no play Shimmering silver linen culottes and a cowl-back metallic rose gold slip nodded to the labels more feminine proclivities of the past in a soign new way$$Karen Walker has a thing for the esoteric Last season she was inspired by obscure British sci-fi series Sapphire and Steel and this season it was a remote town in Russia that provided her jumping-off pointand the only link between the two is that youve probably never heard of either Backstage before her show Walker explained her inspiration We came across these photos taken in the 80s of this unmarked town just north of Moscow called Star City that was a secret military training base for the Soviet Unions space program And there were all these photos of these funny folksy chintzy Russian sitting rooms but with space suits and space gloves Walker always a fan of intriguing juxtapositions said she wanted to contrast the folksy domestic and ordinary with high-tech cutting-edge utility And she continued a shot of glam Because it was quite an elite glamorous city It was difficult to make heads or tails of the idea But then the show started If Walker is a little bonkers for using such bizarre obscure reference points there is certainly a method to her madness She was able to suffuse elements of her inspiration into an utterly wearable collection A small detail like an extended exposed zipper on high-waisted pants recalled the training jumpsuits astronauts might wear without hitting the viewer over the head with the revelation You wouldnt think that space suits and peasant blouses go together but Walker somehow made it work Supple gold leather pieces (a nod to the Mercury space suit) were styled with Edwardian blouses and ribbed sweaters (and sometimes topped with a jaunty necktie) There was an 80s vibe to the whole collection which exerted itself most boldly in the acid-washed denim pieces Walker also ingeniously added a horizontal zipper to two floaty white dresses allowing the wearer to zip off the bottom and create a shorter dress or top It proved that utility neednt be slick or complicated to be effective$$Outside the Kate Spade New York presentation a balmy scent of flowers seemed to douse the surrounding sidewalks Chief creative officer Deborah Lloyd had partnered with the floral company FTD placing almost 30000 flowers in the space After a harsh winter when that first day of spring breaks how relieved we all are to buy our first flowers at the bodega she said of the inspiration And that feeling was evident in the clothes Flowers were everywhere mostly in patterns There were florets in grayscale shades splattered onto an A-line skirt and in abstract black and white on a shift dress delicate daisies dotted a slouchy jumpsuit  But it was the more pared-back use of floral printsand springtime colorsthat hit home The subtle outline of blossoms was charmingly laser-cut onto the hem and neckline of a daffodil yellow fit-and-flare frock and the same pattern was smartly infused into a polished skirt set Reminiscent of a stylish stroll to the corner store there was a charming white sequin shift dress striped in candied tones of pastel rose sunflower royal blue and apricot But the real winner A black strapless cocktail dress covered in petal appliqus was the freshest and most perennial piece$$Katie Ermilios designs have quickly become staples of the red carpet trotted out by celebrities like Jessica Alba Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez With the designer's Spring collection which emphasized curve-skimming silhouettes and self-created luxe fabrics it was obvious that her focus hasnt wavered from occasion-dressing Taking tennis as a theme Ermilio translated the aerial views of center court into sleek strapless gowns empire-waist jumpsuits and fitted double-faced silk skirts converting the fresh palette of the racquet grounds into a smooth color wheel of Pepto pinks and sage greens  Ermilios use of linear patterns smartly complemented her body-hugging fits A pinstripe duchesse dress mirrored the grids on the court while the tonal checks in emerald gave a high-waisted trumpet skirt less of a froufrou effect and more structure But Ermilio also put a pointed spin on her eveningwear specialty by creating separates that could easily become elevated daytime pieces For example there was pair of Betty Drapertype pink checked high-waisted trousers that could just as easily be worn with a classic white tee or Ermilios matching crop top in four-ply silk Not just for cocktail hour the designer seemed to say and we couldnt agree more$$A collection titled Chinatown might conjure up images of girls in silk qipao dresses and embroidered pajamas But the New York City neighborhoods mash-up of Chinese traditions crowded streets and diverse residents has been a constant source of inspiration for Katie Gallagher throughout her career The designer has lived and worked in the area for nearly a decade and for Spring she translated its singular energy into clothes that were easy minimal and just a touch charming Its really just about my take on Chinatown and what I smell feel and see when Im there Gallagher said That came through in the color palette which was predominantly black and white with pops of red and goldlike Chinese gold or a taxibut it was also felt in the delicate textures Still the stone-washed silk slip dresses would no doubt stand up to the Mott Street hustle some of them had a vaguely Eastern influence with apron necklines Gallagher also whipped up a slouchy cherry red tote as a nod to the plastic shopping bags you pick up at Chinatown markets That tongue-in-cheek accessory lent a softer more playful element to the collection It felt fresh for Gallagher whose oeuvre is characteristically more edgy and conceptual$$Designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon love a far-flung unexpected destination for their Kenzo shows Those who made it out to the Nineteenth Arrondissement this morning though were transported to a different milieu in more ways than one Gigantic white arches were stacked on the runway and painted with the shades of pink and peach that recalled the sun-washed architecture of Mediterranean towns such as Portofino in Italy   Kenzo is a brand that's global and nomadic at its core so having endless summer vacation vibes built into the set was a nice touch And with their new collection the New York duo addressed how a well-traveled modern woman can put some of that feeling into her everyday wardrobe The word swimtimates will sound unfamiliar to some but essentially it takes the traditional idea of a bathing suit into your lingerie drawer an approach to summer dressing that cool young things on the festival circuit will understand There were compelling renditions on the runway that were worth flaunting knit geometric pieces that peeked from under spaghetti utilitarian minidresses and updates on the 90s bodysuits that were paired with printed miniskirts  The fanny pack that other 90s favorite got a makeover too and the best example was fashioned military style with three small pouches on a waist-cinching belt Lim and Leon have a knack for making practical and Instagrammable accessories like this though the ornate chandelier earrings and bold necklaces were a little misplaced within the sporty graphic context of the collection The sensible ankle-strap gladiator sandals that came with spiky reflexology footbeds put the skin-baring printed looks on a fresh footing$$The last time Kimora Lee Simmons formally presented her KLS collection it was back in December when her label made its debut In the meantime Simmons has been busyshe gave birth to a son and opened up the KLS Kimora Lee Simmons flagship in Beverly Hills in a jewel-box space as Simmons described it today The new KLS collection also demonstrated that Simmons has spent the intervening months evolving her labels point of view if only slightly There was the same emphasis on graphic pencil dresses executed in flattering ponte blends and a similar smattering of sporty pieces like a pair of slouchy trousers with a track-pant stripe down each leg But Simmons included a broader range of silhouettes this time aroundfull skirts and minis Grecian-draped dresses and gowns boxy blazers and a fairly broad array of trouser shapes The best of the latter was the mannish pair of slacks done in a slightly shiny pinstripe which the designer showed with a matching halter-neck vest It was a sexy feminine take on a classic menswear look Another new development here was Simmonss expanded range of separates of which the standouts were her crisp shirts with sheer panels and leather biker jackets with sleeves that zipped off to three-quarter-length All in all the collection felt more rounded than the debut and it had a lot more spark Onward and upward$$For the runway debut of her year-old label Koch Christelle Kocher turned the lower concourse of Les Halles into her venue and set the showtime for 900 pm With all the mall shops closed and commuters dispersedand with no actual runway save for the orderly clustering of gueststhe cavernous brutalist space gave many clues to her brand positioning Kocher pointed out how the show space was non-elitist yet in the heart of Paris within five minutes of the Louvre yet adjacent to the citys busiest public transport station accessible yet unpredictable Her casting ranged from Soo Joo Park and Charlotte Free to a girl handpicked off the street to her neighbor in the 20th arrondissement But even without a single auxiliary aid the clothes broadcast how the intersection of couture detailing and streetwear styling could lead to a kinetic distinctively contemporary collection Kocher also serves as the artistic director for Maison Lemari one of the specialist ateliers (in this case feathers) owned by Chanel subsidiary Paraffection Embroideries undertaken by sister ateliers Montex and Lesage embellished sports bras basketball shorts T-shirts and parkas showing how craftsmanship remains a designers ultimate power play The tank bedecked in feathers and bling the tracksuit encrusted with tulle and the bodysuit paved in iridescent paillettesif these pieces arent destined for performers known by their acronym aliases (MIA and FKA twigs were looking at you) then they demand personalities with comparable moxie Still its too early to tell whether Kocher is trying to degrade flashy or elevate trashy Likely both At least that was the impression made by the earrings and rings she created with Goossens the couture jewelry atelier They spread across fingers and crawled up ears like mangled marvels$$Junichi Abe launched Kolor more than a decade ago as a mens line one aimed at a certain type of stylish man the kind for whom a sweatshirt is never just a sweatshirt and whose sneaker selection is not necessarily a reflection of his athleticism Abes comparatively fledgling womens collection now in its second official season has a markedly similar aesthetic in mind military touches on parkas and vest pockets narrow-cut cotton trousers topped with netted tulle and of course sweatshirts though here they boast jersey backs or pleated tulle trimmings along with the occasional frilled high collarVictoriana meets Champion Abe develops all of his textiles himself and they are unique to the house so what might feel de rigeurhammered silver and gold lace metallic-stamped organzaupon close inspection is subtly spectacular the lace here pleated miraculously to show its shiny underside Layered oversize polka-dot T-shirts were worn loose off the body and over houndstooth printed shorts an exploration of what a brand representative (Abe was not present at the presentation) called where good taste meets bad taste Ballooning skirts appeared to be made of parachutes if parachutes were also made of tutus Abe has never been afraid of a little color and bold stripes reigned supreme with flashes of fluorescent tones put to good use on trims like that of a standout bomber jacket slim and olive and just the type of layering piece any person needs in their wardrobe for an unpredictable spring Shoes a new undertaking for the designer came in three styles a thick ridge-soled kitten-heel pump a platform brogue and a platform sandal inspired by one from the men's collection the top rendered in richly earth-toned suede The aim of this collection an aide explained is in step with much of this season not to dress some impossible woman but rather real women specifically the Kolor Man's girlfriend At least they're in good company$$KTZ designer Marjan Pejoski and partner Sasko Bezovski decamped to New York Fashion Week last season saying at the time that they werent sure where theyd be unveiling future collections because they liked the idea of going where the spirit moved them As it turned out they wound up back in London this season and it seems that Pejoski was seeing his hometown with fresh eyes If theres one inescapable sight in London these days its the construction site This town is evolving at speed The new KTZ collection seized on both the imagery of the construction site and its augury of a remapped cityscape signs at the club space where the KTZ show was held tonight blinked the phrase The World to Come These clothes had a very different tone from the ones shown by KTZ in recent seasons The labels signature club kid vibe remained in place but Pejoski cashed in the nomadic vibe of previous collections and conjured a gritty urban feeling in its place Out with the tribal motifs and heavy mirror embroidery in with chain-link patterns paint spatter and wordy patches redolent of pasted-up flyers This seasons most intriguing evolution meanwhile was found in the tailored looks like a sculptural trench coat made out of a fabric that resembled a crumpled brown paper bag The suggestion was made explicit by Pejoskis fluttering handle embellishments which he also used on looks in black leather There was a menacing quality to this collection Nothing too overt though there was a gothic note to some of the looks What read as dark was Pejoskis way of spotlighting the visual elements of the city we generally try not to seethe blur of litter and temporary fencing around the lots where shiny skyscrapers are going up You got the feeling that the club kids who comprise the cult of KTZ number among the things unseen that will be swept away when the new city emerges Pejoski proffered the optimistic The World to Come tonight He might equally well have opted for The Last Rave$$The French sportswear label founded almost a century ago by tennis champ Ren Lacoste had the good sense in 2010 to install Felipe Oliveira Baptista at the creative helm If they were looking to jazz up the brand with youthful verve and crisp urbanism for which the Portuguese designer was then becoming known thats exactly what they got Which is to say at the mens and womens Spring collection today tellingly few polo shirts could be spotted and there was little croc insignia We may see some Olympic inspiration as the rest of the collections play out but not every brand can lay claim to it the way Lacoste can The label will once again dress the French Olympic delegation as the athletes in Rio make their way around the opening ceremony next year And there is a historical link Lacoste himself was an Olympic medalist back in 1924 Thats how Baptista arrived at the theme of flags for Spring channeling the victorious moment an Olympian is draped in his or her countrys flag upon winning gold He abstracted fragmented and recombined any number of national bannersFrench Swiss Japanese Americanany number of ways across shirts tanks shorts jackets (often tied around the waist) ponchos and otherwise simple suits Against that kind of kaleidoscope an all-silver jumpsuitalluding to those shiny blankets athletes wear for warmthstood out all the more The closing looks with their jumble of stars and stripes all jostling for attention couldnt have made a more provocative statement without crossing over into trite rainbow territory Ultimately said Baptista its about peace and diversity$$And bringing the heart soul and attitude back to Paris fashion please welcome    Mr Alber Elbaz Theres a little bit of a fightback against one-note compliantly market-obedient fashion going on at the moment and how nice it was to see Alber Elbaz putting Lanvin out there on the front line tonight He staged his Spring collection literally as theater placing the Lanvin name up in glittering lights at one end of the runway and sending out a show he said was a manifesto More on Elbazs underlying thoughts later In the moment it was the fast pace of his girls and their almost fierce range of character that turned this into a hit Lanvin variety performance The show moved swiftly through acts First black and white daywearpants and blouses with balloon sleeves or rippling flounces were followed by chic-simple silk dresses and sculptural cocktail numbers Parodies of body-exposing draped jersey red carpet gowns underpinned with nude corsetry gave way to madly glittery party things with a wacky finaleof busy Lanvin souvenir prints featuring patterns of shoes and bags and funny graffitied handbags But back to the manifesto Elbaz described in a preview how hed been struggling to work through the puzzles confronting designers in a digital age What is relevant today Is it need or provocation Can fashion and theater coexist He concluded that he should try to show all-encompassingextremes and just as importantly leave evidence of his work in progress We saw that human touch in the black dresses that were collaged from several types of lace and the lines of white basting stitches left in the folds of a black gazar skirt Still there is little need for backstory explanations when the transcendent desirability of clothes speaks as directly to an audience as it did tonight$$Lela Rose did a lot of hiking this past year and this season she wanted to bring the overgrown fields of wildflowers she stumbled upon during her rambling walks onto the runway The challenge then was how to incorporate floralsa done-to-death spring motifin a new way Rose was more interested in the endless variations  present in nature than anything else so she injected her blooms with surprising hits of metallic and neon pink and yellow for a twist on the classic pattern She also played around with texture and embellishments In addition to her signature fil coupe there were metallic tweed dresses hemmed with fringe jacquard stamped with metallic and even a blush skirt and shell top combination that made a case for crochet after dark  Rose is perhaps best known for her feminine and romantic dresses and while those were on full display the designer also showed shes willing to forgo some of the sweetness for a little freshness A blush jumpsuit would have been saccharine with a full bow at the waistinstead Rose left the knot slightly undone A white shirt and short combo which almost appeared to be made from a sporty mesh turned out to be made from a perfectly country clubappropriate white eyelet Her willingness to get outside of her comfort zone worked in her favor for the most part but it also led to a few missteps A gray knit dress felt a bit out of place and some of the crystal embellishment verged into tween territory  But Roses customer is not necessarily after anything groundbreaking and there were plenty of looks that were just plain pretty A white organza gown embroidered with white flowers would make a stunning wedding dress while a cotton poplin shirtdress with a wide metallic hem proved that Roses grown-up elegance can indeed be artfully translated for day$$The Uniqlo and Lemaire collection goes on sale Friday at Uniqlo stores including the one here in Paris near the Palais Garnier We spied at least one editor plotting her purchases on her phone Im planning on spending a thousand dollars another confided Christophe Lemaire and his partner Sarah-Linh Tran have been instrumental in setting the current vogue for a covered-up calm yet alluring silhouette For women who crave the look (and men theyve also done a mens range with a restrained uniform-like sensibility) the chance to get it at Uniqlo prices is too good to pass up  Back at their own label Lemaire and Tran continued to work within their familiar framework Fringed scarves tied high on the neck and leather boots with woven espadrille soles gave the collection a slightly Spanish flavor Otherwise the tailoring was away from the body perhaps more than usual with side seams curving around the legs of pants causing them to bell at the hem Lengths were midi and longer and aside from a single off-the-shoulder top there was little in the way of skin Skin is something this show could have used more of A couple of the models were swimming in their artist smocks and the dress-over-pants situation felt heavy for a Spring collection Were not calling for a volte-face here just recognition that the collection tilted a touch too austere That said there was romance if you looked hard enough Je suis belle on me la dit (Someone told me Im beautiful) was printed in lilting script at the bottom of a soft white blouse Indeed the model who wore it was$$A brazenly colorful Leonard show took place just steps from the Andy Warholwallpapered faade of the Muse dArt Moderne where a new retrospective on the artist opened last week Whether sheer coincidence or timely homage the collection which remains overseen by Parisian designer Yiqing Yin stayed loyal to the Leonard archivesno soup cans bananas or hibiscus flowers But the saturation of hues dynamic pattern arrangements integration of graphic text and repetition of screened images all traced back to an unmistakable source Yin cited an urgency for what she called a livelier look when describing how the filmy printed organza lacquered eel skin and woven leather sneakers and sandals all appeared triple-dipped in primary pigments But the show introduced these elements gradually the opening grouping featured faint rainbow crosshatching with the diaphanous skirt prettiest of all As the lineup transitioned from white as its anchor to red and then to cobalt blue Yin applied increasing creative license to the heritage slick Windbreakers and color-blocked dresses with deep draping and frisky cutouts were the most street-influenced shes gone so far In some cases too much print mixing turned chaotic Backstage and off the runway however these same pieces proved rather refined The museum retrospective happens to be called Warhol Unlimited Leonard can pursue this same artistic intensity and distinctive vision as long as it accepts that some of its longtime customers might not be willing to come along for the ride$$The Far East has been exerting an influence on some of this seasons catwalks China and Japan are obviously more than booming markets paying homage to their cultural heritage while enticing a massive customer base with a huge spending potential is on every brands radar At todays Les Copains show creative director Stefania Bandiera was following the already ripe trend Backstage she mentioned a muse who was a modern Madame Butterfly a contemporary geisha an educated traveler an art lover Being a contemporary geisha might seem like something of an oxymoron but Bandiera appeared positively unfazed Kimonos and samurais cherry blossoms and peonies exotic birds and birch forests Ming porcelains and lacquered reds camellias and Silk Roads With the exception of Marco Polo all the obvious references were present The collection was built around the elaborate jacquard and knitwear techniques for which Les Copains is known Circle skirts with asymmetrical hems were paired with folded bustiers cinched at the waist with elasticated obis or worn with thick hand-knitted micro tops short peplum dresses were cut with an elegant origami draping effect High-waisted trousers were elongated and fluid they were topped by short sporty blousons made with what Bandiera called virtual illusory knitwear a sort of virtuoso technique of weaving an extremely thin yarn to achieve a delicate barely there look They added a modern energetic spin to a collection that despite all the overly literal hypercharged references looked quite balanced and wearable$$Every designers worst nightmare Johnson Hartig just lived it when UPS lost a pair of boxes in transit to New York City containing not a couple but 20 to 30 of Libertines key garments for their Spring show Fortunately this seasons offering was a larger one than usual for the label but Hartigs team still had to scramble for 48 hours to make tonights show come to pass A punkish DIY ethos has always characterized the designers work and on tonights runway there it was writ large (Its also the subject of a forthcoming Rizzoli coffee-table book about the label out later this month) Had the show notes not told of the calamity youd never have guessed it had occurred Here was a collection as deliciously profuse as any of Libertines past efforts with inspirations that included fluorescence cell research and Staffordshire dogs The latter came after a World of Interiors spread on Hartigs home decreed that Johnson Hartig is making Staffordshire dogs cool again And so the traditional porcelain pooches came to be one of the collections reigning motifs seen sparkling on the front of the killer opening coat or printed all over a caftan The fluoro cells lent the clothes a goodly dose of Day-Glo and appeared as electric-looking microbes on a mens sweatshirt microscopes could be spotted among the eyes There were also Buddhas beakers and perfume bottles on various toppers Speaking of outerwear (a Hartig forte) among Springs highlights were a cream-color trench with ambiguous drippy-looking blobs rendered in pink studs and a stunning brocade coat with the wordswhat elseJoie de Vivre emblazoned across the back More references more fabrications more fun Look at the great Bergdorf Goodman exclusive hand-painted clutches from illustrator Donald Robertson who sat front row alongside one of the loftiest iconoclasts of them all Iris Apfel On the bags youll find Morticia and Gomez Addams a crimson pout a forkful of spaghetti and God knows what else Heels meanwhile came tricked out with Day-Glo plastic chains How does the Libertine woman walk with all those chains clacking at her feet you ask As she does all things unapologetically$$Theres no doubt that Lisa Perry knows how to create a summer-ready wardrobe and today with temperatures surging up into the 90s her light dresses in punchy shades could not have been more appropriate The collection was a direct response to the artist Robert Irwin's series of paintings Whos Afraid of Red Yellow and Blue And Perry was evidently not afraid with pieces like a shift dress in bold Piet Mondrian tiers of black white red yellow and blue and a swing dress dotted with geometric shapes in the same color palette Perry also used jewel tones in a set of cocktail looks a royal blue dcolletage-diving dress and a high-neck crimson frock For those who prefer more toned-down hues rather than the standout color wheel there was a charming set of little black dresses including one with spliced sleeves and a dickey collar and a midi dress with patent-leather piping Minimalist adornments elevated the more pared-back pieces A black linen tunic had large grommets on bell sleeves while a white halter dress used the grommet as a loophole for the neck strap   In addition to the muted and primary color palettes Perry didnt forget her signature shock of hot pink It was there in a long T-shirt dressa perfect piece for anyone who fears nothing beyond the red yellow and blue$$Im interested in leather techniques and innovation said Jonathan Anderson I want to work with that and to sharpen the edge He was speaking at the conclusion of a Loewe presentation that threw out hard-to-define imagerya bit spacey a bit 80s but in another sense totally grounded in a house reality Give or take a couple pairs of plastic-wrap trousers and transparent pants the show Anderson pulled together was essentially a brilliant walking exhibition of accessories He is a curator with an eye for placing multiple products in an interesting context and making them wantable from many angles Take the jewelry Once youd seen the gold bracelets with their gold fringes pouring down the hand the eye was inevitably drawn to the bags and the variety of things that were happening with the signature Puzzle shape I wanted the bags to articulate the look to electrify it said Anderson The house of Loewe is an old established Spanish fine leather company but Anderson understands that nothing could be duller than to dutifully put a luxurious leather coat with a matching bag His project is to de-bourgeois-ify the context and thats how he came up with the device of using man-made materialsPVC injection-molded syntheticsnext to the traditional I thought what else could be like a second skin Whats really clever is the way every look can be parsed down to desirable components Where there are impossibly wearable plastic wrap pants there is also a regular sweater with a sheer yoke destined to go straight to retail Where theres a showpiece tunic covered in smashed mirror pieces so are there dozens of buyable shard earrings Alongside the avant-garde Puzzles there are just as many made in beautiful leather and suede Equally as smart is the placement of the wholly normal within this new hyper-styled arrangement There was nothing at all outrageous about the superfine patchworked suede tracksuit in this showits the sort of leisure purchase Loewe has been selling to its existing customers for decades Now maybe a fashion-bent trophy hunter will be looking for that sort of thing too In that way Anderson is keeping everyone happy editors and photographers wholl want to shoot the extreme image as well as fashion-conscious shoppers and the people whove been buying Loewe as part of a lifestyle for years Not to mention the brands owner LVMH which must be standing back and admiring what Anderson is doing for the bottom line by now$$And here are the handbags in the back if youd like to see them too Ah yes the handbags Longchamp sells a great many of those Since 1993 more than 32 million examples of one model aloneLe Pliage its signature nylon or all-leather totehave dangled from tasteful wrists around the world Which made Sophie Delafontaines question a telling one for by placing this ready-to-wear collection at the front of her presentation and tucking that core product away at the back Longchamps artistic director was making a statement Were not just all about about the bags capisce Which is kind of true With great restraint Delafontaine resisted any urge to garland her RTW-clad lookbook models with too many of her handbags But when she didand once you had seen both front of presentation and backit became apparent how closely the design notes of the two categories aligned So a sweet simple graphic and slightly oversize T-shirt of soft pink cut by thick black lines at the waist and sleeves matched exactly the colorways of a leather reversible tote next door That pink brushstroke print featured on the clothes (most successfully on a summer-night white zip-up coat) as well as the bags as did the stripes in monochrome and two shades of green Ditto the interestingly shimmery metallic finish that was rippled with orange and yellow The standout pieces were the most straightforward the contra-color popper-pocket shorts and skirts were supercute as were the raw cut fabric-lined leather bombers Depending on what you wear under it the transparent hooded mini trench could look pretty good too And that solar flareeffect leather in a little ripcord hoodie would make fine music festival outerwear This collection is a rather literal exercise in brand extension truebut it contains some attractive and wearable pieces that could serve as usefully in a summer wardrobe as a Le Pliage does in your hand$$We exist on the digital frontier at the dawn of a virtual age in which all experience will be filtered through screens Nicolas Ghesquire long one of fashions most intrepid designers isnt looking back Since he arrived at Louis Vuitton in early 2014 the idea of travel has propelled him Vuitton has been in the business of making luggage since 1854 after all But this season he took a different kind of journey We are all living with this new dimension he said afterward We are all managing how to integrate these new notions of digital virtual and cyber with our real life A conversation between technology and nature animated the new collection his most audacious yet for the house and one that had his fans chiming The old Nicolas is back The old Nicolas was a sci-fi obsessive and an experimentalist qualities he subsumed early on during his tenure at LV that came rocketing to the fore here His reference points were many Wong Kar Wais 2046 and the anime series Evangelion came up backstage The show itself started with an introduction to the video game Minecraft which will be familiar to anyone with young children Later a sound clip from Tron Legacy the original of which was a favorite movie from Ghesquires own childhood played I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer Jeff Bridges intoned What did they look like Ships Motorcycles Were the circuits like freeways I kept dreaming of a world I thought Id never see and then one day    I got in  Ghesquires cyberpunks wore moto jackets and metal-embroidered skirts laser-cut leathers and beaded knits that coded like armor and spaceship-print pants Leather gauntlets keyed a tough aggressive attitude but the designers vision was not a dystopic one On the contrary He was quick to point out that his materials looked high-tech but were actually not synthetics at all What with the nailhead-embroidered peasant dresses the crafty sweaters and the festival-girl crop tops and shorts Vuitton Spring looked a lot like a digital bohemia$$Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema meets Marisa Berenson As far as inspiration goes thats a daring match But for Luisa Beccaria it was a successful one at least in the garden where the action for her Spring collection took place It was a quite literal celebration of flower poweror an homage to a horticultural obsession Billowy dresses bloomed with a lavish abundance of lilacs roses carnations irises hydrangeas tulips violets cornflowers periwinkles cyclamens Printed or embroidered in exquisite appliqus they called to mind From Marie Antoinette's Garden a recently published tome that praised the encyclopedic love that the French queen had for all the flowery specimens she tried to grow at the Petit Trianon her pastoral retreat Ever the romantic Beccaria indulged her passion for long ethereal gowns in wispy organza lace and chiffon They had a prairie-chic spirit spiced up with a hint of folklore Seventies bohemian silhouettes added a fresh spin to an ultrafeminine lineup of Empire-waisted frothy dresses with bouffant sleeves and coquette dcolletages Wide-brimmed straw hats and languid floral scarves completed the bucolic look The crowd of posh mothers and daughters part of Beccarias loyal family-and-friends audience looked very pleased ready to order dresses that would be perfect for weddings in historical Tuscan villas or tea parties in manicured gardens$$To hear Lutz Huelle speak about his clothes is to be on the receiving end of all sorts of mini revelations To wit I like that something appears sexy because the person inside it decides it is going to be sexy The supporting evidence a trench coat or gray jersey tunic that could be unzipped from the shoulder down the arm Or else hell consider how a garment might exist in a fixed seductive state of sliding off the body this he did by suspending the core of black parka from diamant straps flipping its raison dtre from outerwear to evening attire Huelle operates from the premise that his designs need to end up being worn otherwise as he puts it Whats the point But his application of elasticized seaming to alter volumes or the flapper fringing spilling forth from a boxy blazer also backed up his belief in eccentric simplicity There were other indications throughout the Spring collection that this under-the-radar Paris-based designer studies construction without overthinking it A dress pleated from neckline to hemline was bookended with circular denim sleeves the result was slouchy yet flattering If the pliant meshakin to citrus-fruit nettingseemed less essential than other pieces it also layered the looks with unexpected edge Speaking of unexpected Huelle arrived at his final looks by accident upon realizing that the sheer perimeter of an embroidered sample made for a dynamic overleaf He loved the idea so much that he tacked an oversize square of black silk onto the front of a white T-shirt dress How easy how right$$In the age of diffusion lines and fast-fashion collaborations where designers are brands and celebrities in their own right Lyn Devon is a breath of fresh air Despite having been in business for 10 years (an accomplishment in and of itself) and enjoying a loyal customer base Devon is far from a household name And thats just fine She prefers to stay small focusing on longtime private clients whom she often hosts in her atelier housed in a cozy Upper East Side town house It suits me she said during an appointment I like having a mom-and-pop vibe Devons design aestheticwhich she describes as elegant put-together clothes her clients who tend to fall between the ages of 35 and 65 can throw on and then forget aboutis as quietly powerful as her business strategy This season she took inspiration from origami and traditional Japanese dress to surprising if subtle effect Paper-thin dresses and tunics were hand-painted by Japanese artist Ken-Ichi Takahashi with botanical and pastoral scenes and the designer introduced a gorgeous pleated hakama pant in khaki and dusty pink Most items in the collection were unlined to emphasize a certain weightlessness and ease of dress For Spring Devon said she thought the idea of tying yourself in felt romantic and so several of her dresses and coats came with a long ropelike belt that could be left off or wrapped around the waist It gives the wearer some autonomy she noted A washed silk coatsomewhere between a robe and a trenchwas a prime example of Devons sweet spot the kind of effortlessly chic piece women on either end of her core age spectrum will fall in love with$$The unrelenting pace of fashion can make it feel a bit like a circus so why not channel that into a collection inspired by trapeze artists tightrope walkers and other high-flying acts M Missoni is one of the few brands that would go for such playful inspiration its signatures include Lurex unexpected color combinations and ribbed knitswhich taken together can lend itself to circus iconography Plus M loves a theme Last season it was all about Texas while other past references have ranged from Shanghai to Little Red Riding Hood done with a wink and plenty of sparkle every time Some of this seasons updates were bold and exaggerated like high ruffled collars (evoking Pierrot clown costumes) lion prints and graphic swirling shapes inspired by big-top tents Elsewhere the whimsical theme was a bit more subduedsee the rainbow-striped jumpsuit bow tie details and color-blocked macram skirt For those who cant quite get behind the ringmaster connotations though you cant beat M Missonis classic knits Clingy sweater dresses and ribbed wide-leg pants in shades of lime fuchsia and lavender would make familiar yet fresh wardrobe additionsespecially if you buy the star-printed sneakers to match$$For Marcia Patmos everything always goes back to travel The ability to seamlessly unpack ones life in a different place is a central concept of the brand Her past collections have referenced far-flung locales like Uzbekistan and Japan but this season Patmos trained her eye a little closer to home drawing upon summer nights spent in the Hamptons and Montauk Imagining the kind of thing youd want to pull on as the air grows cooler at the beach Patmos created an array of cozy transitional pieces like a chunky cardigan scarf worn around the shoulders with two deep pockets and a poncho-like contraption that read as a dress and could be worn over a bathing suit or a full outfit Patmos is not a girly girl but she wanted to incorporate ruffles into the collection partially because she had let her imagination stray slightly to Cuba She did so in the least twee way possible on a slouchy gray cardigan and the sleeves of a white T-shirt She also made a good case for knitwear for eveningan open-knit metallic tank with a fringed hem was a standout Its the kind of thing that will work even if the only island you inhabit next summer is Manhattan$$Why mess with success Under the direction of Somsack Sikhounmuong Madewell has proven itself to be JCrews most solid bet in the face of financial troubles With the designer shifted over to improve the fortunes of the big sister brand this summer new Madewell creative director Joyce Lee has stayed his winning course in her first outing for the label (a Madewell vet of seven years she worked closely with Sikhounmuong before his decampment to JCrew) It was a little sweeter perhaps but whats arguably most remarkable about Madewell is its knack for conjuring up a convincingly familiar quality in spanking-new mass-market clothing Plenty of the styles here looked as if they had seen a road trip or two or at the very least were ready-made for making memories in Consider unexpected vintage touches like custom embroidery (Springs high-waisted flares plus cheeky cherry-red script is a combo that will be hard to beat) or the cosmic cowboyesque stitching on the back of a fatigue jacket All that 70s-hued bohemia found a foil in girlish pieces such as striped rompers and frocks edged in broderie anglaise But perhaps most charming (and savvy) of all was Lees choice to introduce collaborative styles including price-friendly patchworked jeans in partnership with insider-y favorite B-Sides$$You can take the Kitsun girl out of Parisdrop her down in Tokyo Hong Kong or Manhattan saybut you cant take Paris out of the Kitsun girl The Spring images suggest she has ended up in some sort of Dadaist dream a desert locale care of Pierpaolo Ferrari where mountains of gold foil rise from the sand and red doors lead to nowhere In Look 9 in which she is eclipsed by a pair of enormous lips the grid-printed dress-parka combo reads unquestionably Kitsun Ditto the floral-brocade bandeau and high-waisted shorts The womenswear is reliably gamine that way A jersey Teddy jacket and pochette bearing familiar block lettering are true to character the mini empire of Maison Kitsun has risen off the backs (and fronts) of those eager to sport sweatshirts that spread the word But the generously proportioned dress midi skirt and white suit in Looks 6 18 and 20 respectively are evidence that the brand understands it must grow up if it is to grow out If eternally youthful cocreator Gildas Loac speaks as confidently about the overall directionincluding international customers and store expansionsas he does fabrications he can also cherry-pick pieces that show off how far Maison Kitsuns clothes have come Mixed-knit gauges and sweatshirts shaved down to create a mesh-like pattern for example represent ideas that will continue to be developed Desert theme or not the collarless utility jacket in slubbed cotton Japanese indigo leisurewear and patterned tie-front sundresses are instantly likable items that refresh a wardrobe without going to extremes$$A girl in a giant green beehive with silver petalpainted eyes wearing a 50s three-quarter-sleeved clutch coat and a pair of pointy white pumps with bulbous molded heels and toting a capacious white bag was the opener She marked the takeoff point for John Gallianos most rounded and product-filled Maison Margiela collection so far Lo-fi sci-fi was his tagline for it words that came via email rather than straight from the designers mouth as he doesnt appear at the end of his shows nowone of Margielas house traditions he surely values But this was a wholly Galliano trip not an old-school Margiela one He made a delightful merge of vintage-y eccentricity Japanese geisha styling and colorthemes that have constantly been part of Gallianos design territory from the beginning of course The good news was that despite the extreme teased updos and his casting of several androgynous boys to wear dresses this was not one of his excursions into a fantasia of old He had grounded it in a slew of believably wearable clothes for the first time since he arrived at Margiela At one end of the spectrum there was crystal embroidery resembling dangly earrings smothering a mint green 50s coat at the other a pragmatic tailored grass green suit with skinny trousers and a body jacket In between plenty of skirts that might make us think differently about narrow just-above-the-ankle proportions maybe worn with fitted peplumed tops And then for evening and events numerous dresses in extraordinarily subtle combinations of kimono-inspired prints and tintsas well as a glimpse of a gold satin bias-cut slip dress of the kind the designer brought into fashion in the 90s Galliano is back on his game againa relief for those who supported him in the first place and a thrill for another generation whove grown up to see him through new eyes$$Imagine you could temporarily step away from your life and escape to some far-flung corner of the world where a lover awaits what would you want to wear Rabih Kayrouz offered this as the narrative for a wholly desirable lineup that did not require a backstory to leave a lingering impression He bookended the collection with two very different dresses in the same papery ribbed white organza To start a generous caftan punctuated with placket and side pockets just barely tacked down to finish a floor-grazing gown free of finery In between were traces of tailoring that imbued the looks with assured grace from a jumpsuit that folded and flushed around the body to smoking jackets furnished with a fluted overlay offering hands a place to hide  The seductive touches were just as tacit slender slits extended arm openings that converged at the waist or a double set of dress straps framing the dcolletage Similarly the djellaba-inspired robes and fluid draping transmitted the weightlessness of a consummated love affairthe frisson of the body at its freest Suddenly theres nothing to restrict said Kayrouz backstage Its very pure this time Arguably it was also expressivea motif of rainbow ribbons projected pure optimism while a green hue that evoked antique banker lamps suggested his muse wasnt all that concerned about staying inconspicuous The fact that the collection unfurled to the soulful songs of Millie Jackson struck a chord in the absence of the actual escape these clothes were channeling the longing They almost made the heart achein a good way$$Resort was Declan Kearneys first outing as the new creative director of Maiyet It was a breakthrough moment for the brand A veteran of Alexander Wang and Jason Wu Kearney injected Maiyet with a fresh vitality turning out clothes with a high desirability factor The pea coat in particular made the top of a few editors wish lists but there were plenty of other great pieces to wear too Today marked Kearneys debut runway show as well as Maiyets first in New York after a few years in Paris and retailer turnout was high  The brainchild of Kristy Caylor Paul Van Zyl and Daniel Lubetzky Maiyet is an American-born company with a global perspective one that enlists artisans from around the world to weave silk or do beadwork and reinvests in the artisans communities Its a noble mission The thing is women shop with their heart not their conscience Kearneys Resort clothes appealed to both He aimed high for Spring Amelia Earhart and NASAs unsung mathematician Katherine Johnson gave the collection a utilitarian backbone Arizonas Antelope Canyon inspired the striated swoosh motif that appeared on a few loose shifts Knits were a highlight especially a chunky ribbed T-shirt dress that was accessorized by a Bolivian macram scarf and a tunic-length plaid knit sweater worn over a hammered silk slip dress one of the shows dominant silhouettes The burnout velvet numbers at the end were luminous But overall the collection suffered a bit for its washed-out palette and felt a bit flat If Kearney failed to raise pulses quite as high as he did with his first effort he has the time and more importantly the talent to raise the bar$$Eh whats the point That in a nutshell was the thought galvanizing Maki Ohs latest collection Lagos-based designer Amaka Osakwe likes to draw on unexpected themes but a tribute to human futility may be her most far-fetched yet Osakwe was thinking about Sisyphus she said and Camuss quote Our life is built on the hope for tomorrow yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and the Yoruban trick among parents of sending their bored kids around to nearby homes in search of arodan a thing that doesnt actually exist The Almodvar film Talk to Her and the karuwai courtesans of northern Nigeria were bouncing around Osakwes headspace as well making for a rich brew Which in the end was the point Life may be futile Osakwes collection posited but it is also deliciously full Osakwes engagement with existential absurdism freed her up There was a new sense of looseness in the silhouettes witnessed particularly in Osakwes terrific fluid trousers and a refreshing playfulness found in the collections rather daffy approach to embellishment and print Scalloped edges thread embroidery a dash of distressed denim graphic appliqu feathers fringe Lurex meshOsakwe had at it coercing coherence from the mix with her innate sense of discipline She gave herself permission to experiment in other words but the overall effect was far from slapdash And a few of her flourishes had a philosophical weight one doesnt often discover in clothes Note for instance the indigo teardrop print which when you peered inside the tears revealed an underprint of delicate flowers Osakwe is a designer with an urgent need for her clothes to mean something this time out she encompassed that meaning in looks that were her most wearable yet Why wear a relaxed ruffled dress of geometric black broderie anglaise Why not Life is short We take our pleasures where we find them$$Backstage before his show Manish Arora introduced Bunnyla a floppy-eared fashionista who would be making several appearances on the catwalk in some cases enrobed just like her model chaperones The designer then revealed Bunnylas belly ring and the condoms tucked into her bejeweled briefs For writers accustomed to finding young women in a state of undress the sight of Arora enthusiastically lifting a stuffed toys skirt might have been a first But he did this by way of explaining how the Spring collection marked a departure into adult territory Why be pigeonholed into couture tracksuits for raver girls when he could stretch his wings with glamorous gypsy dresses for disco queens Most noticeably Arora swapped the moon boots for metallic platforms by Terry de Havilland and kept his lineup light on pants (the handful of mens looks notwithstanding) In turn he went extra-heavy on full skirts in highlighter hues shoulder- and midriff-bearing tops trimmed with laser-cut filmy fringes and minidresses exploding with plastic flowers  When asked why he pushed into a more feminine arguably costumey register at exactly the moment that people are gravitating toward sport clothes Arora joked How much more could I do adding that he wasnt so much concerned about his customers maturing as elevating his psychedelic aesthetic to a new level of luxe But by now youd think he might realize how easy it is to overdose and past a certain point in the show the groovy folkloric buzz wore off Luckily he was saved by veteran model Debra Shaw who brought a welcome dash of diva to his decadence Bunnyla meanwhile will be multiplied many times over for retail$$Mara Hoffman isnt afraid to take her inspirations literally Willie Nelson was the starting point for her Spring collection and you could sense it from the first look Nelsons beloved song Blue Skies was playing and the set was decorated with a bright sky backdrop that mirrored the models own sky-print suit The girls even sported Nelsons signature waist-length braids in case you didnt pick up on the reference But the musician has a very particular take on Americana which presented a new challenge for Hoffman whose print-heavy collections are known for being exotic She updated Levi's by embroidering them with cornstalks and experimented with classic shirting silhouettes but she also made a point of casting diverse models to represent Americas rich blend of cultures What really felt new for Hoffman though were the tomboy looks Slouchy overalls boxy suits with bolo ties and button-down shirts with popped collars were some of the most masculine clothes shes done but she was drawing from her own personal style My collections are really feminine but more often than not Im in vintage jeans and a shirt buttoned all the way up she said Of course that can be really sexy Even Hoffmans most covered-up propositions like the closing looka sheer star-embroidered shirtdress layered over matching wide-leg pantsfelt alluring in an unexpected way$$New York Fashion Week began and ended with giant spectacles Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy show was contemplative or at least set out to be Marc Jacobss tonight was a clamorous exuberant affair Both got the public involved Its still hard to score access but the shows are less and less an insular insiders-only experience  Circumstance forced Jacobs out of his usual venuesometimes the Army needs the Lexington Avenue Armory He said he jumped at the chance to show in the Ziegfeldas a native New Yorker he grew up seeing movies at the famous theaterand that the innovative setup was custom-fit to the special location Marc Jacobs One Night Only blazed the marquee Inside there was popcorn and fountain drinks cigarette girls offered candy and ushers dispensed Playbills (not a mixed metaphor the original Ziegfeld showed musicals not movies) as they led celebrities like Bette Midler Winona Ryder Sandra Bernhard and Sofia Coppola to their seats Outside models including Bella Hadid Guinevere van Seenus Emily Ratajkowski and the singer Beth Ditto walked the length of a red carpet that stretched for half a block stopping for a picture at the Marc Jacobs step-and-repeat before they made their way up the stairs and into the theater where we watched the street-side happenings on the Ziegfelds giant screen  The show was a love letter to the movies Americas greatest invention to America itself and to a New York City thats all but vanished The Ziegfeld is the largest surviving single-screen theater in Manhattan and trumpeter Brian Newman and his band played punk progenitors the New York Dollss 1973 song Trash Nostalgia is the most powerful force in Jacobss work This season he indulged his insatiable catholic tendencies High culture (Maria Callas as Medea) low (showgirls) and things in between (Janet Leigh in Psycho) mingled on the runway You couldnt help but think that Andy Warhol would have appreciated it not least of all because some of the prints were suggestive of the Pop artists silkscreens  Its the kind of collection that will reward an up-close lookdense with detail and hidden meanings and totally irresistible$$The entertainment multi-hyphenate Marcelo Burlon naturally didnt opt for a static presentation to showcase his burgeoning brand County of Milan Having sprouted from a T-shirt line into a label stocked in hundreds of global stores his womenswear now includes leather outerwear Italian embroidery and allover printed tailoring And for Spring the show producer events planner musician artist and social media magnet channeled his disparate skills into the evenings artistic pursuita dance performance choreographed by Kirikoo Des His tribe of dancers (which included a voguing champion from the House of Ninja and a French Lido dancer) were clad in County of Milan garb and writhed to a soundtrack composed by Burlon and Davide Squillace It was an arresting sight especially in a darkened theater one the Argentine creative director said he used to frequent when he dreamed of becoming a dancer The collections motifseagles snakes and graphics taken from a Lamborghini and Burlon collaboration moved to the beat with a 3-D projection playing in the foreground It was at times awkward when some of the dancers yelled out but still such a welcome change from the usual show format Also unusual Despite the fact that the Milan designer has captured an Instagram following and the fact that many well-known photographers were in attendance few showgoers were unable to take their eyes off the choreography and the clothes Applause instead of phone photography at a runway show A rare sight these days indeed Afterward flicking through his lookbook Burlon said he specifically chose to incorporate the poncho into his Spring collection While elsewhere it may be considered a winter garment in his native country the blanket-like cloak is used to fend off the sun in gold-embossed silk it is bound to appeal as are his new buyer-friendly denim separates (the line sells at Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue) Motifs such as wings were taken up a notch from allover prints to metallic embroidery on the back of leather jackets silk tops and even slides It was a smart act to follow for the casual crowd$$As any department store shopper can attest the biggest problem with designers lower-priced labels is that many fail to capture the magic you see on the runway of their main line For Marchesa Notte the sister collection of Marchesa that usually isn't the case Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig launched Notte back in 2007 to give their couture customers slightly less-fantastical options for garden parties weddings and other nonred carpet affairs With a more approachable price point to matchdresses range from $800 to $1000Notte has also become a go-to for high school proms Girls who are still dreaming about the bird-inspired Jordan almondcolored fairy-tale gowns that hit the Marchesa runway a few days ago will delight in the fact that Notte pulled inspiration from the same places The big difference was in the silhouettes which were just a bit simpler They lent themselves equally well to Marchesa propers rose gold embroideries petal appliqus and tasteful cutouts An added bonus Most of these dresses were relatively ageless save for a blush A-line minidress with tulle overlay and life-size flower embellishments which would look particularly sweet on younger girls with sneakers or gladiator sandals$$They dont refer to fashions flock for nothing Keren Craig and Georgina Chapman looked to the skies for inspiration for their Spring collection and found it slightly closer to earth in a botanical menagerie of caged birds These were represented by fluffy feathered skirts 3-D embroideries of flora and fauna artfully arched modesty-preserving wings and colorful dcollet accents poking out from the bodice of sleek corsets on red carpetready gowns  Sheer boudoir-inspired evening looks in black and nude Chantilly lace provoked further rumination on the caged bird concept The sweeping ombr-dyed tiered tulle trains in shades of sorbet caused a riot of Instagram snaps among a front row section occupied by a gaggle of Disney Channel starlets eager to scrum for their debut in the larger celebrity ecosystem (On the other end of the spectrum and the runway was Bette Midler to whom a thickly jeweled sheer-shouldered gown in deep navy was of significantly more interest) And what else is Marchesa for if not exquisitely rendered red carpet moments for ones own inner Disney princess That a few of the dresses left some runway detritus (a fistful of feathers here petals of tulle there)turning a devoted Harvey Weinstein into a quick one-man clean-up crewonly proved that even the brightest peacocks among us have to return to reality now and again And you know what they say about birds of a feather$$Since his earliest days on the Milan runway Marco de Vincenzo has distinguished himself by his use of embellishments He has a fine eye for the way color pattern and texture can highlight and accentuate a womans body Up until now hes taken inspiration when it was obvious at all from his base in Rome but a recent trip to Japan inspired todays exploration of Eastern motifs The red disc of Japans flag appeared on a couple of tops and Mt Fuji featured on one or two others De Vincenzo used silken kimono fabrics for a handful of coats that did a nice job of straddling the day-night divide  Owing to his decorative tendencies De Vincenzos eveningwear has received the lions share of the presss attention Picking up where his Fall collection left off he made a strong effort here to broaden his before-dark offerings A fanciful kind of girl will appreciate the outfit that combined an over-printed silver leather jean jacket a rainbow-striped collared shirt and a lavender pencil skirt in a squiggle motif that was echoed on the metal heels of strappy sandals De Vincenzo was fairly brazen about mismatching patterns here and it totally paid off  It was with some of the eveningwear that he stumbled A wisp of a dress with a single breast in ruffle-swathed optic lace probably shouldnt have made it out of the atelier The underwire detailing on other dresses proved almost as distracting Elsewhere though the tinkering paid off Chiffon shredded like confetti read like fur from a distance in the hand it was almost preternaturally light In a bid for the minimalists in the room De Vincenzo showed midi-length gilets and flared pants in the fabric in monochrome black and white but it was a true marvel on a coat that shaded from black at the shoulders through white red and blue to a deep yellow band at the hem$$No matter what the latest trends are dictating the concept of high-low juxtaposition will always be in style Marissa Webb has built her business around contrasts like masculine and feminine hard and soft edgy and sweet For Spring Webb didnt veer too far from those signatures but her inspiration lent a fresh genuinely new angle After flipping through old 1950s photographs of her grandfather Albert decked out in military fatigues beside her grandmother who favored prim dresses she realized how great those uniforms would look mixed together The result was a collection rich with texture color and volume  Instead of adhering to one specific vibe Webb tends to play with mini themes throughout her collections here there were neon orange lace dresses grungy plaids and a pale pink skinny suit which offered a slicker take on Le Smoking But the best looks featured some kind of vest a plaid-and-lace dress with a leather pinafore-style vest or a swishy floral gown topped with an abbreviated army jacket From a distance the vests and dresses appeared to be fused together for one easy piece but shoppers will be able to buy them separately come next year That kind of styling trick calls to mind Webbs career-defining stint at JCrewarguably the harbinger of the modern mash-up lookbut perhaps well see more of those mixed references at her Banana Republic presentation this Saturday$$As fashion formulas go heaping playful decorative motifs onto a template of featherlight streetwear seems promising And it certainly succeeded for Markus Lupfer who this season presented a confident tight variation of his it-just-works recipe His theme was so out of left field as to seem arbitrary flowers and Mexican wrestlers As he explained it I envisaged this hard desert land Then it starts raining and fields of flowers bloom Chrysanthemum embroideries rustled around illustrations of ham-thighed colorfully masked wrestlers on T-shirts and sweatshirts made of French lace or black organza skirts shorts and bombers Chokers and vulcanized skater shoes were garlanded with more blooms in beads pins and sequins An appliqu wave rippled across more organza while Lupfers strongest traditional evening proposal was a rose-gold flower-heaped fil coupe shift with a layered underskirt Printed drawstring silk-mix track pants shorts and tees meanwhile were the pieces you could imagine buying and wearing straight out of the store Imposing sometimes-borderline OTT decorations onto elevated versions of pieces that so many young women wear every day is a pretty sweet niche and Lupfer has clearly made it his own$$Mentally undressing models is not the usual activity of a fashion reviewer Were here to evaluate clothes not bodies But at Marni the mind couldnt help inquiring What was happening under all those triangular asymmetrical layers The suspicionhope evenwas that it might be a simple anchoring slip as the back views of some of Consuelo Castiglionis looks gave a glimpse of satin and straps From the front the rigid leather and ponyskin camisole-like aprons and tunics of her first outfits seemed a clue that she was presenting an abstracted thought about the key garment of the season Later on the shape reappearedat times as long dresses in oversize sport mesh other times as plain wool structures with geometric chunks cut out of the skirtsand always amongst assemblages of other garments That adds up to a lot to put on all at once Marni is a brand with a woman-friendly reputation for color and print and this collection did have plenty of it Castiglioni proved her eye for the right orange red tobacco brown and bottle green which few designers would dare place in the same collection as egg yolk yellow primary blue and shell pink But it was with her giant leaf prints on graceful elongated tunics over fluid trousers that the collection really hit its stride It was then that the anxious viewer stopped worrying about what it would feel like to manage all those semi-garments and began to appreciate the chic neo-moderne metal and dangly acetate earrings and chunky lacquer bracelets that are such a Marni draw No one will ever want this brand to go minimalist but when Castiglioni shows a little less she makes her customers want her more$$Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida arent abrasive rebellious-seeming people at allif anything they seem pleasantly down-to-earth (Marta) and almost shy (Paulo) But these two apart from being incredibly hard-working are also quietly obstinate about going their own way  From the beginning they took what seemed an extreme path with their super-shredded denim in direct opposition to what some young Londoners call Downing Street fashion (ie the tendency toward a pretty party dress) and kept their sights on doing clothes for real street As Marta Marques often says the benchmark they always use is whether her 22-year-old sister Sofia finds their clothes acceptable and whether normal girls can find the prices within the realms of affordability Well the extent to which that stubborn luxury-resistant policy has paid off can be seen not just in the innumerable Marques  Almeida pieces in evidence on the Fashion Week crowds but also in the influence of this Portuguese couples work has had on mainstream manufacturing If 2015 is the year a pair of ripped-knee jeans made its way into every girls wardrobe thats thanks to Marta and Paulo Which is why the great and the good of the fashion firmaments of many nations battled through torrential rain to a north London warehouse to witness what Marques  Almeida is offering this spring Answer more of the same destroyed-yet-practical glamour for street bar festival and pub Maybe its the combination of the designers Latin genes and their 90s-revering generational taste that made them come up with ruffles (that wave thats rippling across fashion right now) and transparency In their book though the ruffle-fronted shirt has gone wild and raw-edged roughly chopped into dense halter-bibs while the flounces run across sheer chiffon or down into shaggy-fringed denim skirts If at times the deconstructionism got a bit too skimpy things took a turn for the far more interesting when the couple started taking on new fabricsslubby-beige linen and burlapand working in a crackly-surfaced patent leather and chocolate brown suede There was a traily grunge-by-way-of-Galliano feeling and a tinge of 90s romanticism going on as well butrememberthese designers are not the kind of people who spend their nights partaking of any louche party scene As realists they are carefully deepening their brand by simply reproducing their most-liked shapes (jeans oversize biker jackets halters) in different fabrics Clever$$Post-show Martin Grants supporters congratulated him on what they felt was his best collection yet Not that they were wrong but it prompts the question based on what Heres one theory It felt thoughtfully composed Grant picked up where his pre-collection left off by reintroducing the linen-wool blend that he uses in place of denim as well as the silk organza feathery tinsel aka his summer fur And once again he barely left the confines of black warm white and navy The printsa paint splotch and a medley of stripeswere created by hand and counterbalanced the rough-hewn silk and double-face cotton with rhythmic lift Theres a chance that Grants women offered such unanimous praise because he left out the pieces that in previous seasons existed to attract younger customers to the label Instead he seems to have realized that neckline emphasis is good waistline emphasis is better and slimming emphasis is best of allno matter the age Furthermore the eveningwear optionsfrom chemise and ball skirt to elongating jumpsuitoozed urbane chic Ultimately Grant doesnt leave a writer with much to reportno theme inspiration muse or talking pointswhich might give the false impression that the collection was light on ideas Was it his best Perhaps only Grant is equipped to judge But judging against his recent endeavors it was right up there$$It is weirda sort of barely conceivable telescoping of timeto realize that Mary Katrantzou graduated from Central Saint Martins MA in 2008 with precisely 10 shift dresses each of them digitally printed with oversize images of jewelry (the evidence is in the archives of Vogue Runway) Well look at her now seven years on filling the atrium on the Central Saint Martins campus with a large immensely intricate body of work framed around Roma gypsy dress and cosmic stargazingall of it visible in a vast mirror that reflected the lineup into infinity The G-forces exerted on any designer whose business has taken off so rapidlyKatrantzou sells around the world noware extreme But the remarkable thing about her is how she has adapted over that time always carefully paying attention to critical feedback as she speeds forward After breaking new territory with digital trompe loeil prints which all too swiftly became a widespread style throughout the fashion world she turned away from her computer and went into handcrafted embellishment When people criticized her for being a decorator she moved on to experimenting with sculpted shape And when the response to that hinted that her experiments might be getting too cumbersome she came back with what she presented tonight a collection that combined tiny flower prints micro sequins and metallic quilting in weightlessly fluttery forms It is interestingmaybe even disturbingto wonder why so many designers in Europe have been thinking about the folkloric costume traditions of the peoples of the Balkans Romania Hungary and farther east Can it be that the consciousness of mass migrations in the daily news is ending up processed into floral prints and collaged patchworks on pretty fashionable dresses If so then Katrantzou is not the only designer or label that has become porous to those subconscious influences Mini-rose prints on a black background even turned up on the Topshop runway four hours before Katrantzous show and before that in many variations in the British designer Stuart Veverss Coach collection in New York City last week But Katrantzou in her intelligent way senses the danger of being boxed into a trend In this outing she also showed she can take on the challenge of proving shes able to design without print without color and without embroidery or texture Her passage of pieces involving solid black material cut with couture-like exactitude into A-line skirts and fit-and-flare coat silhouettes was surprising yet instantly desirable Compared with the clothes she was making when she came out of CSM this collection bore almost no relation stylistically The only link between the two is lodged in Katrantzous constantly self-challenging brain And the intellectual result whatever it might be elevated this season to another plane$$Summer may feel like a distant memory now obscured by the fracas of fashion month but the season came to vivid life in Maryam Nassir Zadehs latest offering The designer imagined it as a series of distinct personal chapters The first was bright open and inspirational colored by the time she spent traveling with her family in Italy a heady vision of days in Palermo Rome Puglia and Capri But vacations always enda second chapter told the story of returning to New Yorks harsher often tumultuous realities Zadehs denouement lands somewhere in the middle grounded in a life at home and informed by the perspective of time abroad  The designers Spring lineup was an organic expression of those ideas not too beholden to plot There is a certain intimacy that seems to mark Zadehs clothestheyre both familiar and uncanny Take the gentle volume of a sculptural metallic organza bomber or crisp poplin dresses which came unexpectedly tied halterlike at the neck Ensembles were alternate strokes retro-beachy and rustic likewise in palette pops of lime and cherry red drew a sharp contrast to shades of blush and gold that recalled the gessoed walls of Zadehs summer travelsa lovely dissonance  Still for many MNZ shoppers the biggest news here will be the exciting trials in reworked denim A pair of pants patchworked in varying washes from cornflower on up to indigo will be a sure sellout ditto a softly fraying jacket made from a pair of jeans$$Nautical has been in style in summer at least since Coco Chanel set sail around the Mediterranean with her lover the Duke of Westminster in the 20sand even she cant claim to have invented it since earlier examples of sailor collars and boaters go back to Edwardian times Why else would we automatically call a certain shade of dark blue navy So for a purveyor of classics such as Max Mara the theme is a natural and obvious one And theres nothing wrong with obvious Faced with the oceans of mucked-about and difficult clothes that are proffered as fashion how astonishingly nice would it be to know there was one store where perfectly cut sailor pants striped Breton T-shirts and jerseys peacoats and the like are reliably available Max Maras creative director Ian Griffiths should not fear that this could be a boring missionthe fact is that non-bonkers non-branded classics can actually also be synonymous with cool In his presentation there were plenty of garments that might fall under the classification of great genericsthe sort of clothes that could live with you for years He threw in a couple of novelty notesthe star-pattern knits (no doubt inspired by officers epaulets) and prints of ropes on silk piecesand he couldnt hold back on some quirky styling extending the sleeves of stripy tees and doing up jackets and coats on the wrong button  la 80s John Galliano As a matter of fact Griffiths really doesnt need to try to dress up Max Maras classics in that sort of way at all One day he should see what happens if the company simply marches out 30 variations of a single garmentfar from narrowing his audience he might just convince the young as well as the middle-aged and senior among us After all the democracy of chic has no age limit$$One thing you may not have known until now Sarah Burton in addition to her role as creative director of Alexander McQueen is also in charge of McQ the labels contemporary line McQ was brought back from the licensing world five years ago and has steadily smoothened and shaped itself as McQueens sportier complement with an underlying war cry of corrupting the everyday With a focus on New York in the late 70s to the mid-80sthe no wave art movement especiallyBurton and her team came up with a collection that was both kitschy and hard invigorated by graphic elements like polka dots silvery metallic leathers (even in dress form) and chain accents As for the latter Burton suggests wearing them as suspenders belts or necklaces or all at the same time and layering them with abandoneven over something as lo-fi as an outsize white T-shirt and an ivory-hued skirt The strongest pieces here were the polka-dot numbers namely so in the form of a silk georgette long-sleeved floor-scraping dress punked out with yet another chain Likewise with rose lace options these all held a touch of the macabre romanticism that Burton has woven into McQueen proper It would be nice actually to see more of this element as McQ continues to develop$$New Yorkbased Melitta Baumeister considered scrawling legible writingcatchphrases evenacross her glossy vinyl bonded garments before settling on black spray-paint tagging and white chalk paint I like the illegal aspectthat something beautiful can be defaced and appear destroyed she said from a rental apartment in the east stretch of Paris Surface patterning no matter how unruly marks new territory for the young designer who has become best known for using slick stiff and spongy materials that arent traditionally wearable On that count shes progressed too For Spring Baumeister used second-skin viscose Lycra to offset her exaggerated volumes But lest this sound like shes conceding to retail imperatives the details were as fetishist as everthe bodysuits zippers ran from nape of neck all the way around to the front of the crotch And she figured out how to affix nipple ringtype hardware to a top (and elsewhere to coat closures) so that people can experience the shock value sans pain or permanence Simply by keeping strict about her silhouettes (hey its all relative) Baumeister is showing maturity But for all the checks there remain a few imbalances The back of a padded apron dress consisted only of a harness Add a pair of pants or skirt and the front becomes maternity wear In a perfect world Baumeister would prefer her looks be worn in full an admission thats equal parts understandable and unrealistic In February one or two of them will be featured in BeautyCooper Hewitt Design Triennial  Her work will fit right into an exhibition setting But its clear that fitting in has never been her goal$$At Michael Kors Collection Spring 2016 had a curious but possibly telling dichotomy running through itminimal androgyny in neutrals on the one hand and flowery womanliness in pretty colors on the other In a way it looked as if two collections had been chopped up and merged together so that to quote from the show notes you had for example Lisa wearing Look 13 white linen gauze duster white tissue linen tank white linen gauze utility pant followed by Lindsey in Look 14 a lapis poppy-print georgette dress with frayed floral embroidery Michael Kors is one of the great American storytellers of New York fashion and it scarcely needs to be reiterated that his narrative about a serene discreetly moneyed and always optimistic lifestyle is enthusiastically (and lucratively) received far beyond the United States Would those followers be puzzled by the two strands running through this show Unlikely for both come from the traditional American playbookstripped-down-90s utilitarian go-to-work tailoring and decorative dresses for entertaining and special occasions In other words this was a collection that covered the social waterfront with everything from Korss classic tan suede trenches and billowy poet-sleeved blouses with drawstring necklines to an evening shirtdress with vertically inserted strips of sheer Chantilly lace all of which looked good But perhaps the underlying contrasts between those two aesthetics is also an unconscious reflection of two rival themes that have emerged this week at the New York showsthe celebration of cleaned-up grunge-era style which is everywhere and the newer backlash toward sophisticated pulled-together feminine dressing weve seen from Peter Copping at Oscar de la Renta As it happens with his poppy prints and fil coupe fabrics Kors was on almost exactly the same page as Copping so no matter how his customer feels like playing it come next season Kors has her covered$$A return to nature is already a big theme for Spring 16 but Millys Michelle Smith was perhaps the least likely designer to go there Over the past few years her collections have been all about sporty fabrics graphic colors and structured silhouettes so Spring was almost free-spirited in comparison Smith said she wanted to capture the ephemeral feeling of a summer romance but not in a clich way (read no billowing chiffon or girly florals) Instead she relied on texture to give familiar minimal garments a new sense of ease  Denim linen felt particularly fresh for Milly A strapless no-frills gown would be just as chic with flat mules or strappy stilettos and thats exactly the kind of versatility women are looking for these days Asymmetrical skirts in fluttery silk cady also fit the day-to-night bill as did a range of crispy poplin shirts and dresses When you really stopped to think about it though this collection was more about an attitude than anything else Sure you could see a beach sunset in the rich papaya-and-gold jacquard pieces and plunging necklines exposed a sensual flash of skin But it was also interesting to see the way Smith layered a miniskirt over an extra-long shirtdress or how a bias-cut slip dress floated around the body just so Its those quieter details that added up to the chicest real-life looksthey left room for interpretation  Backstage before the show Smith said it all felt like entirely new territory for her But what designer doesnt love a challenge With sport references on the sharp decline this looked like a promising new direction for Milly$$Mira Mikati set the bar high at her debut last season thanks in part to a cameo collaboration with artist Darcel Disappoints (Craig Redman) For her follow-up she recruited Kaws (Brian Donnelly) The three special-edition multicolored varsity jackets they did together favor Mikatis buoyant vibe more than the grayscale angst of Kawss Companion character Zoom out to the full collection and theres no escaping the fact that fun is her driving forceand for Spring a fantasy road trip across America At a presentation space filled with cactus balloons and bold city signage she showed off how workmanship and a personalized touch elevated her ideas beyond the realm of camp Do not disturb me appeared laser cut and outlined in embroidery on the back of a cotton linen car coat rather than simply printed A comic cityscape pattern inspired by a coloring book featured crayon contributions from her children  If drawing from Santa Fe and New York in equal measure risks a disparate representation of styling souvenirs (from bohemian suede and a crochet poncho to a shrunken blazer and sleeveless trench) the predominance of whiteright down to the sneakersbalanced all of the layering like a gallery backdrop Indeed the progression of the narrativefrom Wake up for Fall to Sleep all day for Springsuggests an outward expression of Mikatis inner dialogue But as much as the text sounds refreshingly unfiltered design is a creative exercise in filtering and to her credit she creates clothes not wearable art Of course at the rate shes going she might just convince the likes of Murakami or Space Invader to join in on the fun Shes certainly sparked the desire to collect$$For Spring 2016 Misha Nonoo presented a series of eminently wearable tomboyish coveralls flirty A-line skirts and culottes in all shades of rusty poppy and chalk white denim and breezy and bright pajama-style suiting There were baby blue cropped T-shirts embroidered with in-jokes (Darling Naughty Square So Real Surreal) breezy white summer separates and swinging bell-sleeved knit frocks and all took inspiration from no less than the Bauhaus movement minimalism by way of Donald Judd and what Nonoo called a 1960s 1970s cool girl vibe  Honestly everyone does the same thing in our industry so how do you stand out asked Nonoo who chose to opt out of the New York show schedule and instead debut her designs in a one-two wallop of a freshly created Instagram account as well as on the backs of a bevy of handpicked fashion influencers from Lena Dunham and Olivia Palermo to New York City Ballet principal dancer Sara Mearns and Linda Rodin who will post selfies in ensembles from the collection on their own accounts today When you have most of your front row built out of people with huge social media followings and what you really want is for them to go to your show take a picture and share it with their followers why dont you just get to that point first asked Nonoo who shot her parochial schoolinspired box-pleat pinafores graph-paper-checked shirtdresses and grosgrain-trimmed jacquard sundresses at Pioneer Works in Red Hook Brooklyn orienting the results to a horizontal wallpaper-style scroll (users will be directed to flip their iPhones) for the new account and who estimates that the cumulative followers of her international band of influencers total somewhere around 8 million (And without a single seating chart) The thought Nonoo explained is that rather than have everyone come to her shell go to where the action isin the steady grips and handbags of fashion editors fans and her customers Ultimately its all about the asset in the first place so if you can create even better assets even more stylized assets said Nonoo then why not just do that Its worth noting that she has recently found success going her own way with the December launch of an in-house e-commerce site proving both fruitful and educational insofar as connecting with the Misha Nonoo customer Things are changing the designer explained doing this beautiful very art-directed shoot in a space that I love that I feel super-comfortable in for me its showing more about my brand and my collection and the environment and the ethos and the philosophy than 15 minutes on a runway Only time will tell if her followers earn that designationbut its a heck of a start$$Turns out you really can go home again For Spring 2016 Angela Missoni took her brand back to its roots Sportswear exclaimed the designer backstage before the show Her boards were full of photographs of Maasai tribespeople (Africa being as Missoni noted the roots of humanity) and the graphic street-centric work of the Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez whose colorful kinetic crosswalks inspired the runway Yet the show was full of the bright breezy vibrant type of jet setready attire that has made the house iconic for decades  The silhouette was long and lean with narrow sweeping cardigans paired with hot pants fete-ready halter-neck dresses in vibrant metallic pleats and open-collared tunics paired with flowing trousers Swimwear boasted generous looping ties or thick layered Maasai-inspired collars Fitted striped polo shirtsthe type of thing Missoni fans have long scoured vintage stores forfelt like a slam dunk Before we were a zigzag we were a stripe said Missoni backstage and for a house with an innately bohemian attitude (and during a season full of splashy occasionally bewildering debuts) you cant get more straightforwardor more comfortingthan that$$Miuccia Prada is interested in the political and the pervy Always has beenbut especially now Todays Miu Miu show had kitschy nylon-looking negligees layered over sweaters and gingham shirts it involved wintry purple and green lozenge-patterned narrow coats and midi pencil skirts fur stoles and boxy Deco-patterned cardigans Anxious that this doesnt make sense Dont be That is exactly Pradas point Though the outrageous glam rockmeets-Kiss multicolored patchwork platform boots are her other point obviously They might as well have had Buy Me Now picked out in the glitter on their heels It all came out in an end-of-season conversation in the dark at the conclusion of the Miu Miu presentationthe show at which the audience is always stir-crazy after looking at clothes for 28 days in four cities and not exactly feeling entirely compos mentis Neither is Prada who talked about how she had to put together both the  mainline Prada collection and Miu Miu in the midst of dealing with the passing of her 103-year-old aunt Nana whom she described as a second mother The designer wasnt at the Prada show so this was the first time she surfaced in public this season Really Miu Miu was about irrationality she began The times we are in are extreme Theres conservatism on both the right and left in politics And then people look for escapes from it attracted to strange religious beliefs or underground clubs and music One of the underground clubs shes thinking of is definitely kinkya sexy salon she quipped laughing as she indicated those see-through negligees which were caught up in quite a few looks As so often was the case this season the assemblages on this runway seemed made to be pulled apart layer by layer and absorbed into a womans wardrobe in whatever manner makes sense to her The ways of high-fashion styling are indeed extreme but surely even the most ambitious blogger wont be daring enough to parade herself in the full Miu Miu rig in front of next seasons street photographers Ladies suffering from dementia may be seen going out shopping thus attired forgetting in which order the nightie goes on but mimicking them in full may be a few steps too far down the road toward kooky delirium for most On the other hand there were the aforementioned boots a major draw in a season of loudly decorative footwork not to mention more conservatively sweet ballet slippers (again with a touch of the confused in their mismatched ribbon ankle ties) tiaras ruffle-neck blousesaSwan Laketutuand within it all goth black-and-white silk pieces printed with candles and cigarette lighters surely a mini collection unto itself Theres a method to Miu Mius madness after all$$Todays gritty MM6 Maison Margiela runway presentation was a flashback to the industrial techno dens of Londons subterranean club scene In a cavernous corner east of the city representatives of the MM6 collective wore anonymous white lab coats The disruptive mood was cemented by the huge bank of analog recording equipmenta wall of sound if you willthat formed the backdrop to this retro-futuristic warehouse party As models took to the stage they stopped to tinker with the equipment as if to create their own soundtrack to what was a hypnotic display These club kids came well prepared for a long nightpacking Coke cans beers and even plastic banana holders in their Perspex cross-body bags (how else to stylishly sustain an all-nighter) MM6 mainlined the chaos and creativity of post-gender club kids beautifully This was an idea-packed show with more than one standout moment There were eagle and equestrian prints glitter-bombed fanny packs retooled as tops and plastic bin liners fashioned into everything from a surprisingly elegant blouson to detachable pouf sleeves and a cerulean sundress Ideas were pulled from not-so-distant eras then reappropriated and repeated There was also a prettiness here (for both boys and girls) in the pink metallic Ziggy Stardust two-pieces and sheer dresses in khaki and pale blue that tied at the neck with pussy bows MM6 surely is a place for its group of designers to have fun mining the dress-up box of recent history But the models with determinedly blank stares and hunched posture resembled androids giving fun a far-off feel$$When you are grown-up its easy to long for the carefree entirely fictional days of youth and forget the reality of dreary schoolbooks and even drearier summer jobs Is it any wonder that as you take your first steps into the adult world you so often arm yourself with powerful fashion fantasies  Molly Goddard in her latest presentation had her real girl models working at a replica of a sandwich factory but they were going about their soul-numbing tasks in clouds of tulle and smocked raw silk ivory frocks Is the designer telling us that this is the way life should be that we must assert our fierce conviction that inside we are all fairy princesses All ballerinasregardless of what life holds for us at the moment Certainly this young designer is striking a chordduring recent Fashion Weeks in London and New York numerous fashion editors (including this author) could be seen squeezing into tiny show seats swathed in billowing Goddard tulle In this latest outing Goddard offered her classic outsize silhouette with a few new embellishmentsa lovely acid green tutu featured hand embroideries tiny pink skirts were awash in burgundy ruffles and there were tartan dresses that seemed like the fantasy version of a school uniform that some little girl who cant wait to grow up is dreaming of$$The program notes described this latest Moncler Gamme Rouge collection as Versailles meets Abstraction which doesnt immediately call to mind luxe sportswear but does suggest something rather rarefied And perhaps this has been the modus operandi of the Gamme Rouge range all alongyet it was never more apparent than today when a mass of maidens ambled up and down a garden path (more enchantingly English than formal French) in looks that married haute couture with high performance After a tender exchange with Lee Radziwill creative director Giambattista Valli explained how a plumped-up slicker in technical lace flounced dresses in embroidered PVC a gray sweatsuit embellished with lilies of the valley and a leotard in red jacquard all expressed varying degrees of the same elite inspirations fencing and French chteaus Indeed when the bar is set this elegant a parka is no longer a parkaits a rococo confection in guipure that happens to be rain resistant Moncler gives me the technical fabrications and the support and I do it in an atelier way Valli noted as Bianca Brandolini dAdda planted a kiss on his cheek The designer conceded that the Spring offering always poses a greater point-of-view challenge than Fall because outerwear isnt the customers priority With this one he plucked more elements from historical dress than usual yet the floral-embroidered sneakers (and sneaker boots) kept the feeling decidedly fresh Though there were quite a few dashing black looks for evening in the mix such a predominantly white collection might send another message to his gilded lilies Said Valli I love the idea that Gamme Rouge is sporty but you can get married in it$$Monique Lhuilliers front row was an apt description of where her brand is headed these days Bella Thorne Ashley Madekwe and nearly a dozen other pretty young things were decked out in the velvet floral dresses and tea-length party frocks that defined the designers latest Fall and Resort collections Considering that youth was one of the themes Lhuillier name-checked at a preview last week those are just the girls who will want to wear Springs super-bold looks on the red carpet Lhuillier has certainly never been afraid of color but in this collection she turned the vibrancy up to the max Bright poppy lipstick pink electric blue and tangerine silk gazar made for sweet sculptural shift dresses as well as more directional looks like an emerald tunic over skinny jacquard flares or a turquoise bustier top with a trailing sash Either of those pant-centric ensembles would be an unexpected choice for say a New York movie premiere or press call Structure was a big message but a parade of feather-light gowns in paint-splatter prints (and minimal embellishment) lent a more ethereal artsier tone The accessories were also hard to miss its still a new category for Lhuillier and here she made the case for matching your shoes to your outfit with jewel-like Lucite wedges and embellished sandals It felt as though she designed them specifically with the red carpet in mind$$Aspiring young designers have two new role models to look up to Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia who presented their first collection for Monse on Saturday afternoon The duo met during stints at Oscar de la Renta where they discovered their own strengthsKim as design studio director Garcia as a top designerwhile learning from a beloved industry legend  For their buzzy debut which saw Prabal Gurung Domenico De Sole and Ruth Wilson sitting front row Kim and Garcia presented an original yet approachable vision We like the idea of relaxed glamour Garcia said before the show A classic shirt was the starting point for everything We realized its something that a lot of people can relate towe just looked at it in a different way The first dress out was a cotton poplin mini that mimicked an oversize shirt wrapped artfully around the shoulders It checked all the right boxes There was texture a fresh silhouette and just a hint of charmall in one youthful and wearable garment It was followed by a billowing maxi dress with a similar wrapped-and-knotted effect Of course the construction likely wasnt as easy as tying a bowbreaking down an item as familiar as the button-down shirt wouldnt work unless the craftsmanship was meticulous and a bit restrained Those white cotton pieces were naturally relaxed but even the grander propositions in silk faille taffeta and duchesse satin felt effortless We wanted it to look like you just buttoned it up and were done Kim said Were inspired by real girls today who wear jeans flats    They want something easy  Its a concept that mirrored de la Rentas own passion for ready-to-wearclothes that make women feel beautiful without being complicated You could sense his influence in the rich jewel tones and luxe fabrics too and in the 3-D cotton flowers and oversize bows Prepare to hear a lot more from Monse in the coming months$$Nobody but nobody is having more fun than Jeremy Scott at Moschino Season by season the ideas get zanier but the productions just keep getting bigger And why not when his clothes and accessories are selling so well True to silly form tonights theme was car-wash couture Traffic cones barricades and a genuine car wash that sprayed bubbles instead of water were installed on the runway No Parking Couture Zone one sign read another Dangerous Couture Ahead Also true to form this was not a show about subtext But if it was all out there on the waxed and polished surface that doesnt mean it wasnt smart Take the full-skirted trench coat with a warning sign on the backOpen Trench it reador the little black dress with the iconic red octagon on the chest printed Shop not Stop In a he-thinks-of-everything moment Scott had none other than Lapo Elkann international playboy and heir to the Fiat automobile fortune in the front row  The accessories served up one visual pun after another None other than Stephen Jones milliner to fashion royals and royal royals did the veiled hard hats and traffic cone chapeaux There were toolbox and lunch-box bags tail-fin sunglasses and caution-tape sandals As for the clothes they were the tony uptown answer to last seasons below-14th-Street streetwear Chanel-style skirt suits came in flashy neons with flashier reflective-tape edging others had Cristbal Balenciagaworthy volumes Scott played fast and loose with Chanel-isms most literally and perhaps dangerously with a print of interlocking C clamps A pair of petticoated satin party dresses with taillights lifted off a 57 Chevy looked like a subtler (if you can call it that) reference to Thierry Muglers iconic corset  An extended evening section that riffed on the rotating brushes of drive-through car washes was capped off by a long column dress with a neon sign slung over one shoulder Scotts got fans just crazy enough to take it for a spin IRL$$There was a quiet confidence this morning at Mother of Pearl Maybe the self-assured mood was helped along by the historic surroundings of the Caf Royal but for her sophomore solo show creative director Amy Powney embraced her pretty pioneer theme with gusto It all started with Victoriana then took a Midwestern turn she said backstage But the real cues came from Laura Wilsons photographs of the Hutterites of Montana a closed community whove farmed the land of the American West since the turn of the century These settlers may eschew the technological trappings of modern life but they sure know their way around a smock dress And as Bon Ivers Holocene was plucked out on the banjo (what else) Powney evoked those prairie pastures with a series of piecrust collar shirts pinafore dresses and pantsuitssome in decorative sequined ginghams and checks and others in botanical prints of her own design It was these trippy patternswhich up close revealed scenes of lobsters carrying combs and narcissistic birds gazing into Alice looking glassesthat were arguably the high point of the collection In line with MOP founder Maia Normans signature sporty vision all this was punctuated by some cleaner sleeker looks The black bonded leather and neoprene coats worn over scholarly mustard-toned tops and track-y pants were supremely wearable But Powney never strayed too far from the frills and the flourisheseven athletic sweatshirts were embellished with ruffles and embroidered roses Add playful footwear to this mixsneaker-soled Mary Janes that were carried through from Resort and pointy-toed 80s bootiesand youve got a collection that is seriously rich in box set inspiration Pull out those copies of Little House on the Prairie and St Elmos Fire now$$Massimo Giorgetti quickly found an audience for his upbeat contemporary brand MSGM launched four years ago Street style types scooped it upits bright colors and loud prints are irresistible to photographersand now the label is found in hundreds of stores across the globe His success landed him the plum assignment of creative director at Emilio Pucci At home at MSGM today he tried something new swapping much of the quirky sweetness of previous seasons for a more tomboyish wannabe badass spirit His notes mentioned Catherine Hardwickes skateboard movie Lords of Dogtown but he couldve just as easily been channeling another subculture turned mass culture like grunge or punk thanks to the shredded plaid separates an oversize hoodie and long knit pants that pooled at the soles of high-top sneaks But Giorgetti didnt fully commit and heavy silver chains wrestled with bows as the shows dominant decorative motif They first dripped from long tunics and laced up the would-be seams of chain-mail tees and skirts (MSGMs full-body collars could make 50 Shades of Greys Anastasia Steele blush) Bows meanwhile adorned waistlines and hips trailing ribbons past the knees Ruffles were supersized too Up until now the magic at MSGM has been in the mix but this season Giorgetti's usual irreverence came off more like indecision$$The ships propeller backdrop and aircraft carrier runway semaphored David Komas theme at Mugler today military What again The frequency with which the uniform of war is press-ganged by designers intent on crafting clothes to love can seem counterintuitive in an industry based on generating innovation Donatella Versace just launched her martial-themed Spring 16 collectiona campaign for gender empowermentwhile Chalayans was a typically dense take inspired by the end of Cubas isolation Every season for either gender you can expect a significant military presence Why Its not complicated When done well military collections can make the utilitarian seem sexy via universally recognizable signifiers Komas casus belli seemed straightforward too Half-hiding behind a mirror to evade well-wishers after this show the designer said We have such incredible girls here and its about being inspired by them Wanting them to look cool to look fresh and to enjoy clothes He rattled through pretty much every military service The first wave was naval an interplay of navy and white with decorative insignia buttons on looks that included an angled peak-lapel three-button double-breasted jacket and minidresses that rearranged the fold and contrast of traditional sailor suits One dress featured a lovely helter-skelter twist of white that twined around the body above a four-button accent Softer items included an asymmetrical-hemmed pliss dress with half-zip details at the waist Next into the field came the army the olive section included a cutaway backless dress in leatherthe top and bottom half linked by a clasp of three gleaming officer stripes Soft kicky trousers were topped with deconstructed bodices while the classic field jacket was turned into a sleeveless minidress with silk poacher pocketsa skinny belt peppered with eyelets cinched the waist A dress decorated with a grid of angular metal openings and dresses crisscrossed with metal-piped slashes were harder to link to Komas theme although the former did demand the wearer go commando She must NOT wear underwear ordered the look-board backstage Komas body-con brigade kept coming some in hefty-heeled pointy-toed monk-strap flats some with the straps of their handbags looped through the epaulets at their shoulder A burst of burnt orange looks ran contrary to the camouflage agenda of real militarywear but had the explosive impact that Muglers customers enjoy The final push was Doutzen Kroes looking invincible in a backless navy jumpsuit This was a deceptively simple but cleverly executed take on military and it won$$The seed for Naeem Khans Spring 2016 collection was first sowed in Mexico where the designer hosted his wifes 60th birthday party The theme of the three-day event was centered around Frida Kahlo and guests were encouraged to come dressed the part flower headdresses and all That idea carried him on a trip to the Mediterranean where his fascination with flowers bloomed Dresses in bougainvillea pink lilac and marigold floated down the runway and some of the most successful looks referenced that influence including a gorgeous lemon floral-beaded caftan gown Khan was also thinking of muses like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren echoes of styles worn by both could be seen in the wasp-waist full-skirted ball gowns A lilac gazar number with rolled bateau neckline particularly recalled Kellywell surely be seeing that one on the red carpet soon Princess gowns have their place as Kelly more than proved in her lifetime but Khan would do well to curb his appetite for embellishment here A dress with a bustier emblazoned with a large glittering heart for instance verged into Disney heroine territory  That embellishment worked best when its design wasnt so overt Backstage Khan said that 600 people worked on the collection up close each gown was clearly a masterpiece so it was disappointing when the message became slightly muddled on the runway The sky-high platform heels seemed another misstep particularly as models struggled not to trip over the delicate skirts Khan has already proven his skill at creating gorgeous red carpetworthy gowns the designer doesnt need to dress it up so much In fact as happened with a few looks the extra fixings detracted from the main course$$Nanette Lepore always manages to inject a swipe of playfulness into her clothes Take this season when the designer introduced her collection at her downtown store transforming the presentation space into a full-on bash Ive always threatened to have a big party said Lepore And then I made fun clothes that people would want to go out in The attire matched the carefree scene ranging from cocktail pieces to daywear all with references that hovered between the late 60s and 70s (Time periods when everything was happening said Lepore) That feel-good let-loose attitude was evoked in an off-the-shoulder black eyelet dress while a floral-print frock in groovy neon blues and purples had a bohemian swing to it Cool retro separates came in a multi-patterned jacket with ruffled kimono sleeves and a polished pair of cropped flares  One infusion however brought the party into the here and now that was the segment of the show devoted to select pieces from Lepores collaboration with Eddie Eddie by Billy Tommy a line of shirts featuring cheeky statements and graphics worn by Miley Cyrus and Kendrick Lamar Lepore translated the statement-making text nicely into body-skimming silhouettes like a Pepto-pink slip dress that was emblazoned with Slippery When Wet and a bubblegum-lacquered midi skirt with a thigh-high slit that had This Is My Favorite Mini Skirt Duh printed on it But it was the Tie Me Up Please Thank You tube top cleverly paired with empire-waist pin-striped gaucho pants thats guaranteed to keep both Lepores grown-up and teenage customers equally entertained at any party$$Narciso Rodriguez is an engineer as much as he is a designer Hes always had a thing for seams and his clothes are constructed like precision instruments After a Fall collection with elongated silhouettes perched on towering heels that took his preoccupations to extremes Rodriguez was after something more sensual here Its a bit undone he said beforehand Outfit number one was a black sateen top as glossy as leather that wrapped asymmetrically around the waist above a pair of full white trousers Not undone by a long shot but it was definitely more relaxed than what hes been up to the last couple of seasons It was followed up with an extremely fitted side-buttoning jacket As a rule though the clothes here floated on the body Silk tees slouched off one shoulder and dresses twisted around the legs to fall in asymmetrical hems  The gentler silhouette was a welcome development So too was Rodriguezs use of fabrics with a keen sense of the hand the sateen that looked like leather and the nubby linen he chose for dresses that arched over one knee which by the way happened to be completely reversible to silk chiffon Tech fabrics tend to have a flatness that leaves you cold There wasnt a chance of that here Rodriguez explained that his starting point was photographs of the ocean floor but the palette was warm bright amber lacquer red and golden mineral rings that swooped across dresses and encircled others from front to back The sea creature embroidery on a bias-cut white silk dress was as exquisite as anything well see all season$$Many designers are rethinking the way they show their wares to press and buyers this season and Neil Barrett is among them In lieu of a jam-packed presentation the Milan-based Brit hung banners and plastered the floor of his Paris showroom with a camo-meets-kaffiyeh-scarf print inviting editors one by one to view his entirely colorless Spring collection Monochromatic after all is a tried-and-true signature for the designer (whose womens lineup remains unapologetically rooted in his menswear background) and the East-meets-West military pattern rings true with his rigorous creations that collide historical references through a linear lens This time around Barrett shook up that rigor by way of bold fringing and pleat details on slinky separates and accessories that loosened up his sleeveless tailoring and jacquard outerwear with a sporty lan Fringes can be fussy but here sliced bands of black leather and its vegan alternative (a savvy compromise for washable T-shirt dresses) read punchy and sleek as wide belts and slashed skirt layers both paired with fanning peplum shirts graphic minis or a generous fluid pant Layered in alternating scales Barretts somewhat militant graphics were softened through their tactile application Wide cotton weaves and a rich silk jacquard ensured zipped blousons and bomber jackets held a dressed-down eveningwear potential Those looks provoked the same twist of tomboy ease he worked into a sleeveless tux jacket thrown over collaged artist tees The series of three features Picasso Hockney and Basquiats faces peeking out from under a kaffiyeh Its an irreverent remix and a diabolical sign of the times$$Nellie Partow specializes in two very different categories tailoring and knitwear Neither lends itself particularly well to the concept of lightness but thats where Partow got to work on her Spring 16 collection Earlier this summer I was just standing in my closet and thinking about how difficult it is to find pieces that are really light and easy she explained You see a lot of silks and wools out there but not really beautiful cotton So she developed a superfine 37-gauge cotton with an Italian mill whipping it into semi-sheer sweaters that scarcely weighed more than tissue paper Elsewhere Partow used similarly buoyant materials such as stretch cotton jacquard fluid crepe and an airy weblike cotton ingrained with silk fibers In layering items like crisp shirts wide-leg pants and natty little blazers those fabrics skimmed the body rather than clung to it   Partow approached her popular hand-knits with a new sense of ease and structure Coated cotton held its shape on a boxy cardigan and different cabling techniques lent a bit of slouch to the designers signature rose gold cutout sweater I love the idea of one of these knits being your jacket she said The contrast between her sharply cut pantswhich have inspired a following of their ownand a nubby artisanal knit will appeal to women who think about texture and shape before print and embellishment Partows color palette also mirrored her quiet approach to luxury Refreshing shades of ice blue and orchid popped against cognac olive green and ivory$$Springs fodder may be new territory for Nicholas K but suffice it to say its in the brands DNA For their latest outing dubbed Terminal Velocity the sister-and-brother team of Nicholas and Christopher Kunz looked at flight suits after all their father was a flight surgeon their brother a Navy SEAL A tenor of utilitarianism was high from the word go starting with a cream-colored parachute trench worn by show opener Sarah Abney Like many of the other items it came with a cross-body rope clasped with a tough-looking carabiner The light glossy nylon the designers used billowed like silk and while it may have been an exploratory move they ran with it whipping yards of the fabric into maxi dresses skirts and ponchosso much as to blend together at times With dip-dyed styles otherworldly-looking silk dresses and trousers in shades of charcoal and saffron they had some real winners on their hands Among the 50 looks the pair might have done with a few more of the pieces akin to those and their capes in supple periwinkle denim clothes that nodded to the presence of a human hand All that nylon felt in places a little anonymous coming up short on covetabilitythough their gorgeous drop-waist jumpsuit in distressed leather surely did not$$Nicole Miller didnt have to look too far for inspiration this season I kind of became obsessed with the grate pattern you see on loading gates said the designer who had cast her eye about and found a petri dish of inspiration in her urban surroundings I took a lot of things very literally from the street she said No kidding One of the recurring prints was of a brick wall plastered with graffiti and the diamond grate motif popped up on denim and dresses and also informed a few sexy cutouts I wanted it to have the grit of New York explained Miller Gritty is not a word usually used to describe her brand and its introduction here may not be appreciated by Millers core customers However theyll find plenty to love in the sheath dresses and sequin maxi gownswhether theyre fans of graffiti or not  Some of the strongest pieces referenced other types of paintingless St Marks Place street art and more Jackson Pollock Indeed a black and white splatter print that appeared on handbags and denim instantly recalled the artist Other standouts included a white sheath dress embroidered with colorful scribbles and a white organza shift with brick-like embroidery and flower paillette appliqus This is where the collection hit its stride when Miller got to what she does best (pretty flattering dresses) and left most of the grit on the New York City sidewalks$$Its a stylists world and the rest of us may well just be living in it But for her Spring outing Nili Lotan harked back to a time when raw young talents were creating not only music but the kind of images that are still setting the tenor for much of what the industry strives for todaybefore every on-the-rise starlet had her look carefully crafted by a team of pros Pictures of Joan Baez Joni Mitchell Cat Stevens and Patti Smith lined Lotans mood board the designer particularly connected with the earnestness of Vietnam War-era singer-songwriters like Baez and Mitchell dubbing this collection Blue 1971 in an homage to the latter Likewise she called on her own 70s adolescence when she was beginning to cement the personal style that defines her brand today Springs free-spirited prcis fell right in step with the codes that have long kept Lotans followers coming back for more slouchy army pants and jackets gauzy bohemian tops and floor-skimming dresses Resorts bewitching eveningwear  la YSL gave way to a mix of casual and rakishly elegant pieces every one of them a wardrobe workhorse The smashing sailor pants looked natty against the gritty milieu of this seasons lookbook bien sr but would have plenty of Jane Birkin-esque appeal teamed with Lotans plunging blouses in sheer fluttering chiffon (Serge Gainsbourg and his longtime lover made up the European contingent on the designers mood board) The latter drew a stark and lovely contrast to a grouping of military-tinged items like a hardy utilitarian-looking dress in olive drab with gorgeous lace-up detailing Lotan may have streamlined the offering of her famously lush knits but with the wealth of winning options here fans are sure to find plenty to stock their wardrobes till fall$$Guillaume Henry has the goodwill of the fashion community He gave Carven which was a defunct couture house when he arrived in 2009 a global profile and a distinctive look Women responded to Carvens gamine sensibility and the brand grew quickly opening a store in New York Tonights show was Henrys second for Nina Ricci but he hasnt yet found his footing Its an issue more of tone than execution though both play a part His backstage mood board was pinned with pictures of Romy Schneider in the 1971 film Max et les Ferrailleurs and images of 90s models like Kate Moss Nadja Auermann and Kristen McMenamy Id love men to fall in love with [the Nina Ricci woman] he said  Thats not a bad goal but this was provocation without seduction a fact that came down to the stiffness of some of his materials the sheerness of others and a generally slack away-from-the-body silhouette The shows patent ostrich skin had a glossy almost lurid sheen but it was about as unyielding as materials get The black-and-white cowhide coat and apron-dress werent much more forgiving This will no doubt make us sound both American and prudish Considering Nina Ricci is a brand historically known for its lingerie it wouldve been nice to see a bra underneath Henrys sheer organza blousons But his see-through wrap skirts were an even bigger miss The best pieces here were the micro-pliss shifts which enhanced the models natural hourglass shapes Henry should keep them in mind when he begins working on his next collection$$Fashion may fall head over teakettle for decades in fullOh the 70s with their suede and their slouch Give us a 40s tea dress Or the 90s slipbut in real life real women reach into their closets to be confronted with (if theyre lucky) a living record of any variety of erasAlessandro DellAcqualeaned into this reality with his collection for Spring Its inspired by Corinne Dayso 90sand the fabulous Tina Modotti the designer said backstage before the show Modotti the actress and photographer died nearlyhalf a century before Days iconic snaps of Kate Moss which gives an idea of the temporal range DellAcqua was working with Its about inverting images overlapping and reworking masculine and feminine and quite sexy said the designer There were macram dresses in soft pastel shades crepe pinafores and cotton lace with chantilly overlay all in various stages of tumbling off the body to illustrate DellAcquas pointthough this was less an overt va-va-voom take on sexy than a slightly quiet Manic Pixie Dream Girl one (The diamond tiaras tangled in some models hair aided in the latter notion) Caban-style jackets boasted Latin-inspired ruffles and pom-pom trims narrow overalls came in lace wrap skirts made of strips of python leather and worn with striped boxy tops resembled nothing so much as a backgammon boardand oh the rules of love There were also worn under nearly everything white T-shirts tank tops and deconstructed button-downs with ties left dangling to the windCrepede Chine blouses and jumpers boasted a delicate design that upon further inspection became a subtle in-joke lit cigarettes trailing swirls of smoke (Remember 90s) Berbere inspired sandals (pom-poms feathers sequins) were equally anything-goes and it was all resoundingly for the girl who doesnt dress for the decade shes in (or even the decade she wishes it to be) so much as wholly for herself$$As the owner of New York Citys well-loved Centre Market Place boutique of the same name Karin Bereson knows how her No 6 customer shops Her new lineup played savvily to that with a first delivery that was all about cheery 60s- and 70s-hued nostalgia for some much needed sunny vibes in the midst of winter and a second delivery thats all about easy pieces to transition nicely into spring Of course ease is a key selling point of all of Beresons wares Its a subtle evolution from season to season with familiar shapes making comebacks in cheeky prints or jolie laide colors but recent collections have found the designers gamine sensibilities imbued by a new feeling of femininity That came to life most winningly in looks like a pieced-together slip dress in blush linen and silk which would pair just as nicely with sneakers as it would stilettos It had a kind of understated sexiness about it that felt like a particularly nice addition to the spectrum Bereson and her team regularly offer up Still if many of No 6s shoppers are longtime clients who keep coming back for classic mainstays like jumpsuits or the labels terrific culottes and drop-crotch trousers they surely wont bristle at Springs great new expansion efforts First and most notably are four soign footwear styles all made in Peru and all as Bereson puts it shoes that disappear The eminently shoppable bag offering has expanded too building on Resorts leather bucket bag with a half-moon woven shape for the beach and a killer patchworked suede tote No 6 first dipped a toe into the waters of swim for Spring 15 and here turned out two bikinis and two maillots plus a Don Draperpoolside terry-lined shirt and shortsone of the lineups coolest propositions$$And now for something completely different Kei Ninomiya is quietly and painstakingly riveting together a darkly wonderful body of work This collection contained more of his inky-black intricately engineered dresses made by bolting scores of curled polyester organdy strips rendered flowerlike in shape held together with a skeleton of tiny studs The dresses contain not a single stitch and float around the wearer Ninomiyas shapes were more adventurous this time than last and featured jagged sculptural protrusions He has also discovered that when he turns these pieces inside out there is a different texture to their beauty These are amazing but challenging to wear signature pieces  A touch less Lady Gaga but no less dense-with-effort was the dress containing a twist of 7000 hand-applied beads that took two people three days to construct That was the longest said Ninomiya A biker jacket of transparent vinyl worn over some pinstripe culottes was stitched together with a macram of plastic cord another biker was decorated with jagged lines of more transparent plastic and yet another biker with a satin sheen featured arms constructed of Ninomiyas signature studded organdy whose segments undulated over each other and strongly resembled a ravens wings I make things in a new way said Ninomiya And so he does rather brilliantly$$Nurses scrubs may not at first thought set most womens hearts aflutter But inspirations such as that underscore Yara Flinns knack for marrying utilitarianism with lean youthful elegance Spring found the Nomia designer riffing on workwear of different sorts from those aforementioned scrubs (nodded to in a sporty V neck) to fabrications in denim ticking which Flinn stumbled on in researching uniforms at the Mets Costume Institute Reference Library That ticking came to life beautifully as a kimono with raw denim trim  Consistency is a key element of Flinns lineups from season to season hallmarks like her patch pockets and D-ring details tie an evolving body of work neatly together Chances are that her customers can make space in their wardrobes for another of her classic slit-back dusters as well as a newer style for Nomia the terrific slinky one-sleeved dress$$When in doubt go with a classic Today the All In One Dress a style Norma Kamali first introduced back in 1973 became the cornerstone of her Spring collection After seeing a serious response from her distributors the designer is taking a fresh look at the shape sending it out in three lengths (maxi mini and medium) and a variety of prints Wear it as-is with its funnel neck and dolman sleeves or pull an arm through the collar and wear it one-sleeved with the other one tied around your waistper Kamali the possibilities are damn near endless Even if the DIY opportunities of that piece dont delight its charm is mirrored in so many of Kamalis garments Ball them up and toss in a carry-on throw in the wash and start all over again That goes for shapes like her fishtail flare which kicked out in a full circle from the knee and some spruce activewear tailoring While those are sure to please new converts to the Kamali lifestyle for the customer who comes back season after season the designer served up a generous offering of new prints from a splashy painted floral to trompe l'oeil jean patchwork Even better was the real deal a series of fraying raw denim styles like a trench and kicky skirt all reversible and all very cool$$Art has always played a big role in Jordana Warmflash's collections for Novis but while references to Henri Matisse may have skewed too literal in the past a more pared-back approach for Spring should catch buyers attention She drew inspiration from Clarice Cliffs graphic slightly rustic pottery for her vibrant color palette of mint cerulean and poppy while hits of black and white ensured the clothes were for the most part still quite wearable Sleeker silhouettes helped that cause too Column gowns A-line skirts and razor-sharp trousers acted like blank slabs of porcelain to be decorated with geometric prints kitschy landscapes and matte beading Print and color are integral to the Novis message but Warmflash should continue to explore texture as well The best pieces featured a soft color-blocked crochet which captured the theme but also had a warm artisanal feeling that will appeal to a wide range of customers$$Our newness right now is not really newness and to us thats the newness Thats Oaks Louis Terline on the tack the well-loved New Yorkbased brand is taking He makes a valid point The breakneck pace of not just fashion but the world can hardly be sustainable And so Terline and cofounder Jeff Madalena have zeroed in on their obsessions the things that keep an expansive demographic coming back to their stores and website pieces like killer leather jackets knits and trousersall at varying levels of inkiness The other newness Taking cues from the hip employees of Oaks four shops pullovers worn inside out for example or almost comically oversize Those styling tweaks yielded coolly subtle reinventions of staple pieces dropping a sweatshirt shoulder by two inches or adding say 15 to a baseball jacket Where youth culture in fashion is typically something that has trickled so far down as to be totally divorced from whence it came something feels authentic in Terline and Madalenas buy-now-wear-now riffs on what their employees are doing Beyond that their clothes are just plain cool and wearable to boot As Terline tells it theyre always designing back to the jeans For Spring Oaks denim will team with workwear-inspired quilting and sporty touches like a zip-front funnel-neck topall in the brands signature monochromatic palette For the record all that black is as much function as it is fashion chalked up by the designers to tiny New York City apartments with finite storage and the citys general grime But lest things get too geocentric Terline and Madalena havent forgotten their more far-flung followers This season for LA fans the designers are introducing a lightweight take on their classic motorcycle jacketjust new enough$$When will girls stop pining after vintage jeans The high-rise straight-leg style (whether actually vintage or just vintage-inspired) has become more than a trendits totally changed the way we dress Alexandra Michelle was doing non-stretch boy jeans at Objects Without Meaning before everyone else started cutting up their Levis and she quickly earned a cult following for them But the key to Michelles success is that she also answers the question of what to wear with her jeans offering a steady range of luxurious collectible basics like silk camisoles ribbed-knit turtlenecks and linen T-shirts Her approach is as no-frills as it gets minimal silhouettes are elevated with comfy high-quality fabrics and there are zero prints or embellishments save for an unraveling hem here or a twisted strap there It gives her customers room to layer style and accessorize as they please For Spring Michelle expanded both her denim and basics categories First she got a bit more experimental with her indigo Some jeans had blurred squares of darker blue mimicking a patchwork effect while an A-line button-front skirt had a released hem She styled it over ribbed lounge pants elsewhere some of Michelles best-selling powder-blue flares peeked out from under a tea-length poplin dress Those new layering ideas felt freshest hereshe also put her own spin on head-to-toe knit dressing and introduced her first swimsuits which were spare enough to be worn under cardigans and denim shorts$$For someone who has orchestrated theatrically imposing and occasionally improvised stage environments for Kanye West a dfil of 20 looks within a compact contemporary art gallery would seem like no big deal But as this was Virgil Ablohs first runway show for his label Off-Whiteas well as his 35th birthdaythe occasion felt well special Abloh titled his collection Off-Day although not out of some reverse-karmic pre-emptive strike As he explained the latest Off-White undertaking emerged from several streams of thought but principally how cool girls today have figured out that the most relevant dress code has nothing to do with dressing up Abloh (who earned a masters in architecture) used a white tee and blue jeans as his building blocks which he subsequently broke down to arrive at a draped crepe tuxedo top an open-sided gilet tiered maxi sack skirt and flocked grid-pattered pajamas among other transformations Some combination of cropping lengthening offsetting patchworking bias cutting and hand-pleating went into each look And thats not even accounting for the time Abloh spent at the Levi Strauss & Co archives (six pairs of jeans were reworked from the companys denim) or going through the necessary legal channels to redesign an old Grateful Dead crew shirt (via illustrator Othelo Gervacio) All told a lot of effort And yet for Abloh this wasnt enough I want to push the concept of showing in front of an audience in Paris he declared backstage I want it to be a reminder that this is still an art formnot just the clothing but making people gather in a room and creating a moment that opens their minds Hence the clear plastic coats donned by a handful of models as they took their final walkAbloh plans to produce these for his Off-White staff in the spirit of MargielameetsSteve Jobs that is A corporate culture statement coming from someone whos so chill In the spirit of performance art a local graffiti artist closed the show by defacing the coats with a dramatic flourish Guests may have been too ensconced in the rapid-fire tagging to notice a line of lettering placed high on one of the clerestory walls Positioned upside down it spelled out Why are you looking at which Abloh attributed to the ongoing refrain among those who binge on fashion shows so heavily that nothing ultimately registers So was this show any different To the extent that it came across as a multilayered exercise in self-expression yes But often a single lookthose jeans spliced with organza windowpanes for exampleis all it takes$$Really there are any number of ways to do summer style For some theres the desire for the easy the breezy and the often sheer for others theres a chain-fringed bandeau and trouser boasting a Justin Bieberesque quasi-harem drape For either (for both) there is Ohne Titels Spring 2016 collection As usual there were the technically advanced knits the house is known for seen in body-conscious one-shouldered tops and skirts bodysuits bikinis and a red and white fit-and-flare frock that sunny Sunday dreams are made of Nearly all the knits had geometrical patterns painstakingly woven in New for Ohne Titel were the entirely fetching gauzy pleated caftan dresses lightweight pieces in bright summery shades and a series of fringed bra tops skirts and a dress crafted from the chains of ball bearings Off-the-shoulder viscose rompers and separates came in shades of crimson and magenta that felt fresh and easy and easily imagined on any number of vacationing It girls from Montauk to Ibiza But it was a geometrically printed silk shirtdress long lean and slashed at the shoulders in a deep teal and navy combination that felt like the biggest advance made in the pursuit of true summer style$$Olympia Le-Tan doesnt merely infuse her collections with her own personalityshe injects them with her life-experiences too This was an autobiographically touched collage of homage to her relationship with Japan one that Le-Tan first determined to make after hearing of the demolition of her favorite Tokyo hotel the Okura So Hotel Olympia ran the cursive script on the front of her reverse souvenir jacket with a coiled rope logo to reflect her interestan aesthetic one she emphasizedin kinbaku (Japanese bondage)  Binding twisted at the ankle of her hyper-stylized Louboutin geta chokered the neck of some looks fronted Stephen Joness black mesh face masks and formed the wristlets of her signature minaudires These featured Hello Kitty My Melody and Little Twin Starscuteness oclockas well as what looked like illustrations of Hokusai-as-Polaroids The hexagon knits were hat tips to the carpet at Le-Tans lamented hotel and the red teapots a nod to Yasujir Ozus favored recurring cinematic motif The Polaroid prints were illustrations by Le-Tans father Pierre of pictures taken by the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki including some of the designer Eclectic and authentic this collection was particularvery particularto Le-Tan herself That should make it ultra-appealing to her followers Fetishists and Hello Kitty obsessives will no doubt be stimulated too$$A fashion industry vet I know once joked that given the reiteration of certain themes among designers hed like the opportunity to assign fresh concepts to brands Farm-to-table was one of the concepts he proposed Opening Ceremony honchos Carol Lim and Humberto Leon never lack for inventive references and this season they came up with one pretty similar to farm-to-table all on their own Their set in a cavernous space on Wall Street was a marvel to beholdabout a zillion potted plants which will be replanted after the show at four schools around the city as part of the Edible Schoolyard NYC program That worthy initiative was one expression of the new Opening Ceremony collections larger theme Frank Lloyd Wright Wright Lim and Leon explained had a daughter who was a modern dancer and he often designed sets for her shows And as an architect he was concerned with the idea of a home as a set for livingthe place where people perform the daily rituals that taken together add up to a life He was also a fan of intentional communities self-sustaining mini utopias organized on much the same logic as that of indigenous tribes These were all interesting paths to explore via fashion but the problem with this evenings OC outing was that Lim and Leon chose to explore all of them at once The intentional community ideathat would have been a lively and timely organizing principle for a collection but the designers diverted it into the set The dance element came through in the inclusion of dancers who performed seemingly spontaneous choreography among the shows models Mainly the clothes dilated on the theme of home and the decorative elements that make one up Lim and Leon are particularly eclectic in their tastes so their riff on this reflected that sensibility with mixed results This was a difficult collection to wrap your head around Wright-era design elements were one motif imparted for instance in the prevalence of sand tones in the palette and knit dresses and skirts with a weave like that of mid-century chairs Architecture in general got a look notably in the jumpsuits and tunics that featured inverted arch-shaped necklines These were the collections most direct looks and among its very best The laid-back mood of at-home lounging was referenced in silk garments with a certain pajama mien those that featured chinoiserie embroidery boasted surprising streetwise appeal There were other pieces as well that lent a global magpie aesthetic to the proceedings It was easy to isolate standout individual itemsthis collection was especially strong in its trouser silhouettes and its knitsbut the showing as a whole never really cohered It left you wondering what the uniform of a Frank Lloyd Wrightdesigned utopia might have been That farm-to-table conceptits still up for grabs$$I knew this dame was trouble as soon as she walked into my office     The femme fatale is a recurring trope in fashion but its safe to say that none have looked quite like the muse of John Patricks film noirinfluenced new collection Patrick was mostly taking his cues from the high-contrast lighting used in classics of the genre but he also had the wit to propose that trouble of the dame variety neednt come in a slinky red-lipped package Trouble can also be fresh-faced and clad in boyish cropped trousers and a matching jacket or a virginal shift of crisp cotton poplin or a preppy cardigan and high-waist mini Even the cleanest-cut girl has at some point in her life longed to make (or be) trouble Not that Patrick avoided slinkiness entirely In fact this was a sexier outing than usual for him Alongside the slouchy all-Americana staples much of a piece with previous Organic collections there were body-hugging slip dresses in a squishy mesh-like knit and flirty looks in neon tulle and lace An ankle-length T-shirt dress in that neon tulle went so far as to conjure the lurid atmosphere of the Vegas Strip Apparently the Organic girl has a dark side too$$Its been 20 years since Orla Kielys signature leafy prints showed themselves to the world The Irish designer marked the moment in swinging style today with a presentation of adorable clothes and accessories that revealed her secret passion crazy golf the sport also known as mini golf or Putt-Putt I dont play actual golf Kiely admitted gesturing to the sprawling stage set that provided the backdrop for her Spring collection But I love crazy golf Its just so fun And as the sun shone through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Royal Institute of British Architects the models wasted no time in pulling up their cute floral-patterned caddies and taking a putt Kiely pulled her muted palette of coral lime and lilac from the poolside photographs of Slim Aarons and the clothes conjured an uncomplicated trip to Palm Springs California I always love the 60s and 70s said Kiely And its Palm Springs that really sets the tone for that era The silhouettes swung from pinafores and shift dresses to loose flowing jumpsuits all tethered to that mid-century feel The standout moment came in the form of a chartreuse shorts suit in heavy jacquard which made for wholly appropriate sundowner attire Though the swans and windmills and oversize poodle (perhaps inspired by house stylist Leith Clarks much-loved pet pooch) were all well played it was Kiely who really hit a hole in one$$Whats new in a glutted knitwear market The trio behind Orley husband-and-wife team Matthew and Samantha Orley and Matts brother Alex are hard at work figuring out just that Yarns are the bread-and-butter for the brand and so for its third womens offering (the first season Fall 15 was picked up by Barneys) the designers wisely opted to emphasize their foundation in knitwear before branching out into wovens Of an all-knit lineup the team estimated 70 percent to be Italian-loomed the rest handmade in New York and stressed their desire to create a narrative not just a really nice cashmere sweater That end game was clear from the word go with every piece of the Spring lineup speaking to a certain off-kilter almost Tenenbaum-esque take on preppiness from polo shirts to sweater vests (yep sweater vests) Take a cotton-cashmere pleated skirt in a mod-looking custom graphic print It had a splash of retro quirk to it without feeling overly precious A pair of mulberry and tussah silk flares though sat firmly on this side of the 21st century and echoed the industrys current yen for head-to-toe sweater dressingso polished you could take them to the office but so forgivingly stretchy you might just opt to wear them for SVU reruns at home too Things heated up in a cable-knit pullover with a surprisingly sexy back and open panels the result of crocheting around laser-cut plastic discs  At a recent studio preview Alex emphasized the importance of not just reworking their mens styles for womensix months from now the trio expect their girls business to outstrip their guys Here was a lineup that was strong but also single-minded enough that youd look forward to seeing how the label will diversify next season One of the collections standouts a crocheted shift in cherry-red and white stripes offered a promising hint$$Possibly it seems ridiculous to begin a fashion show review with a discussion about the precisely desirable color of a carnation Yet it is a fact that there is a vast gulf of taste between a deli-cum-gas-station pink or white type of a carnation and the deep deep almost cinnamon-dark kind of a red carnation which Oscar de la Renta picked for his daily buttonhole when he was a young man living in Madrid But the fact that Peter Copping Oscars successor picked up on that color and its resonances is a perfect testament to his suitability for the job He like Oscar has a phenomenal eye for color and social tone Apparently said Copping before the show they used to throw red carnations into the ring after a bull fight Which explains the presence of carnation prints in various sizes that Copping scattered on dresses swathed skirts and frilled blouses and the fact that he saturated an eyelet dress in the color of Oscars favorite flower Copping was partially inspired by his discovery that De la Renta had met Ava Gardner whose lover was a bullfighter in the 1950s But to research the Spring collection he had also been up to the Hispanic Society of Harlem to look at their paintings surrounding bullfightinghe took in everything from the pale blue satin of a matador suit painted by Goya to the exact shade of baked yellow Francis Bacon used in a bullfighting scene to the colors of peasant wool embroidery on popular Spanish postcards said Copping Then he let it all percolate in his imagination and came up with a collection that thoroughly proved his own powers as a colorist and as a designer who brings the finesse of Paris with him from all the years he worked at Louis Vuitton and Nina Ricci The combination of respectfulness for the founder and pure personal flair made for a collection that succeeded in making every woman present at the show want to be part of Coppings ravishing modern view of femininity and sexuality The sight of his models scrubbed and groomed with matte red lipstick their hair brushed smoothly into ponytails with low grosgrain ribbon bows made fashions prevailing messy no-makeup grungy beauty suddenly look a whole lot less desirable at a stroke It was not just a question of the breathtaking color choices which ran from saturated to pastelsay emerald green duchesse satin for a skirt suit with a narrow powder pink belt or the grass green embroidered shoes under a mint gazar dressbut also of Coppings ability to undercut froth and frills with a modernizing casualness He did that by putting suits with jet-embroidered flat espadrilles by tying black ribbons nonchalantly into incredible lilac and ice-blue ball gowns and by daring to show glimpses of naked skin through black lace In a word it was faultless$$Plenty of designers have found inspiration in the Amazon jungle but very few have actually visited the place let alone camped there and participated in tribal rituals But then Oskar Metsavahta UNESCO Goodwill ambassador and former doctoris not like most designers  One year ago I went to the Amazon forest and met the Ashninka tribe and was invited to their rituals said Metsavaht The whole collection is inspired by that experience The narrative begins with the monochromatic blue looks in contrasting silk and suede inspired by the ocean and a photo-printed silk dress that referenced the designer's overhead view of the jungle as he flew in As Metsavahts stay with the Ashninka continued he began to incorporate the tribes element of stylethe materials and colors Linen pieces in white or earthy taupe some of which were tied in organic knots at the hip or waist had an attractive rough-hewn quality The lone red look constructed from a latex silk blend that Metsavaht developed was like a red feather sticking up at the back of a headdress And the tribes characteristic face paint was incorporated to surprisingly sophisticated effect in the sheer looks with graphic black lines Bags were made from fish skin an homage to the tribe's practice of using every part of the animal It was a clever translation of a culture that is worlds away from New York Citys hustle and bustle and one that will be as appreciated on these American streets as well as on the beaches in Metsavahts native Brazil Beyond the feathers and face paint what really inspired Metsavaht was the Ashninkas respect for beauty The meaning of aesthetics is very important for them he said Beauty for them means strength and sensualityfor man or for woman And thats exactly what fashion is For Metsavaht who juggles sustainability with a luxury sensibility the Ashninka reinforced an idea about which he is already passionate That fashion frivolous though it may sometimes  be portrayed is far from meaningless$$I ask you for violence in the nonsense and you you give me grace your light and your warmth Osman Yousefzada quoted a wonderful pang-of-passion Frida Kahlo love letter in his notes while references to both her art and her personal style were scattered here and there throughout this collection The beaded tree decorations in the closing looks some of the suiting and Stephen Joness take on Kahlos trademark headbands were among the most sharply drawn Yet Yousefzada insisted with a touch of weariness that such accents were mere mood music For me its just the same thing that I do again and again Clothes basically Which I think women will want And thats what its about Well yes Whether women will want these clothes depends on the women Certainly Osman has a fan base thats especially dedicated to his raved-about suite of pants He is exploiting this happy niche not just by extending his selection of cuts but by extending his market to the most pant-dependent constituencythis collection featured his first runway menswear which starred notable horizontal moire corduroy jackets with a lapel shape imported from cutouts featured in his Fall womenswear collection Although that beading looked fine and the silhouette was dramatic Osmans closing yellow column dress was clearly a trial for the model to walk in More harmonious amalgamations of theory and practice included the striking same-shade halter-neck tiered dress in waxed duchesse silk and his blown-up ikat brocade on blown-up silhouettes The skirted three-tiered pants combined daintiness and jaunt This collection featured a lot more flashes of grace than nonsense$$Every valid fashion show has a built-in sense of its place in the world of where the clothes fit in and where people are supposed to find it exciting and useful to wear them Complex conceptual scenarios from deep within a designers brain can only fascinate so much if the clothes dont have any imaginable destination other than a fashion shoot or awards ceremony So one of the subtexts running through this season is the need for fashion to readjust widen its perspective and stop excluding so many peoples realities Smart creative minds can sketch in an environment subliminally which is exactly what Julien Dossena was up to today at Paco Rabanne as he ran a patched-in mixed-up soundtrack on which the far-off noise of a live performance seemed to boom in the distance Actually that noise was heard at Chlo too And we all relate to what that means festival sounds the new massive social dressing-up opportunity for a generationfrom the beginning of every summer to its end Dossenas collection nailed that context cleverly merging high-tech sportiness with a sense of casual disheveled sexiness Bra-topped baby doll dresses unraveling at the hems walked alongside fitted motocross-influenced leathers silver and khaki anoraks and parkas track pants and vaguely 70s sweaters printed with abstracted Native American motifs On the feet a practical very cool series of suede cut-down biker-cum-Western boot-shoes ideal for coping with desert terrain mud and all-night dancing   At the end Dossena paid direct homage to Paco Rabannes signature space-age chain mail by showing slinky gold dresses and asymmetrical skirts roughed up around the edges with yarn chain stitching or thrown together with an army green sweater Perfectly calibrated as potential stagewear or perhaps just for hanging out in a backstage VIP tent next summer In the 60s Paco Rabanne might have imagined wed all be living on the moon by 2015 but actually this is really where weve landed$$What do you want to wear Thats the question that empire-builders Pamela Skaist-Levy and Gela Nash-Taylor ask each other at the outset of their design process each season Then they take a look at what Nash-Taylors daughter is currently wearing and from that informal poll they conjure a collection This season the duos proposition erred toward the hippie-ish with asymmetrical knit dresses and skirts and slouchy graphic tees providing the contemporary counterpoint to such Easy Riderera staples as fringed suede jackets embroidered peasant blouses and studded leather miniskirts There were other updates toothe patchwork flares for instance were of trompe loeil denim-dyed French terry and the frequently deployed camel-colored suede found its way into sporty items such as track pants The designers want their casual clothes to wear like basics but not look like them and with that in mind they embellished tees and sweaters with knot details and fringe and finished numerous pieces with a mottled wash that added to the collections overarching vintage sensibility The Pam & Gela clothes are flying out the door at the stores where theyre soldapparently when Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor ask each other what they want to wear they furnish an answer many young women agree with$$Todays Pamella Roland affair was the inaugural fashion show to be staged at the Whitney Museum of American Arts new Meatpacking digs If its somewhat surprising that that particular honor didnt go to an artsier designer it should be noted that Roland does sit on the museums board and has been passionately involved in the new space since its earliest days What then would a label that is fluent in mermaid dresses and marked by a kind of princess-y exuberance when it comes to full-throttle glamour offer up for a turn at this bastion of the avant-garde As the designer put it backstage You cant show in a museum and not do art  Roland was especially interested in the work of Frank Stella known for his large-scale geometric paintings in Technicolor palettes (a major retrospective bows at the Whitney in late October) She evoked that oeuvre in subtle ways Some of her nicest propositions came through in a series of silk gowns whose fronts were folded up origami-style to expose the fabrics brilliantly hued undersides Liquid organza was surprisingly techy in a floor-grazing blush number but the huge floppy bow it appeared as on a column gown fell a little flat Rolands real successes here were the ones in which Stellas spirit seemed to guide her most the punchy and relatively spare pieces (though it was hard to deny that a wild-card crystal-encrusted jumpsuit would look pretty great on Mary J Blige who sat front-row) The more precious items like a strapless bubble-hemmed minidress in sea-foam with white roses or a jewel-trimmed 50s-feeling evening coat seemed to run counter to both the designers message and the venue$$No fewer than 11 graduates of Parsons School of Designs esteemed MFA program (Fashion Design and Society) which is touted as the first in the nation of its kind both conceptual and skills based showcased their thesis collections today They were Katherine Mavridis Liya Liu Long Xu Mayako Kano Diletta Cancellato Pengji Cai Ryohei Kawanishi Shih Hsun Lee Sisi Liu Tianfang Jing and Varpu VernaHel Rapeli If their collective output is anything to go by the future of fashion will be a studiously creative place Four of the students were on hand to discuss their work and used pitch-perfect industry parlance in doing so Mavridis from Australia described her technique of weaving tightly coiled tubes into enormous shapes that hardly need a human body to fill them out New Zealander Kano spoke of the delicacy of Meiji-period Japanese photographs in particular the now-faded pigments used for preservation to explain her lacy confections Hailing from China Liya Liu said New York Citys mountains of street garbage waiting for pick up inspired the nylon trash bags of her collection almost none of which were actually sewn as did the enormous amount of waste that goes on in the garment trade And most irreverent of all Kawanishi looked to Dadaism to create the mundane quotidian stupid serious objects on his runway ranging from a bath mat and a toilet paper dispenser to closet hangers and FedEx envelopes Other strong showings came from Xu who used a bamboo-weaving technique from his native China to craft his intricate multicolored pieces Hsun Lee the only mens designer this year who combined  traditional mens tailoring and skateboard gear Sisi Liu who enlarged the ornamental flowers of her box-making hobby into large-scale 3-D versions and Jing also from China who made her ethereal collection by printing folded paper with translucent film In addition to the schools revered course director Shelley Fox Parsonss new dean of fashionand expert in sustainabilityBurak Cakmak was also on hand One of the most important things we teach is that students should have fun he said We allow them to choose their own guiding principles Cakmak replaces Simon Collins Parsonss outgoing dean who was very visibly reveling in the fun his final students were having$$Paul & Joe sent out a metallic pink embossed postcard as the invitation for its Spring show but it may as well have been fronted with a photo of Miami Thats where founder Sophie Mechaly mined references for a collection that was fun frisky and swathed in palm fronds More precisely she said she drew from Scarface and Magnum PI to arrive at key looks such as the halter maxi dresses and slim pastel pantsuits Just as there will always be flora and fauna prints in a Paul & Joe collection so too will there be modified denim sweet flourishes (broderie anglaises ruffle accents) and a boyish wink (shirts or shoes) the difference each season comes from how Mechaly doses them The Miami throwback allowed for a new twist retro jogging attire remixed as silk blousons and shorts or hybridized as a studded tuxedo pant The theme also meant she could go gutsy on glitz from the silver leather trousers to the sequined baby doll and the metallic boots Just in case those pieces didnt sufficiently incite the spirits she added a vintage-style T-shirt with the line Go for it Mechaly was already wearing it like a souvenir from the show$$Paul Smith and his wife Pauline Denyer Smith were once couture show regulars and to this day one of Paulines prize possessions is the last Smoking ever made by Yves Saint Laurent Preshow this afternoon Sir Paul said When you hold that suit the weight is amazingit gives this lovely drape Drape was one of the key preoccupations of this collection which while obviously not produced on a couture level managed to force its fabrics elegantly to assert their designers will against the implacable tug of gravity Thus the first dressa silk-screened mlange of orange on two clashing patternssignaled the turned-up volume Sir Paulstyle of many of the looks that followed The colors were drawn from David Hockney while the disjunctive block shapes of the printed panels looked to be mined from Henri Matisse appropriate enough for a show held at the Serpentine Galleries Smith makes a masterful pant and is especially sensitive to the subtleties of the break Todays finest broke lavishly on a pair that came wide-legged and pin-tucked in gray wool worn under a matching jacket with a lean lapel that featured six mysteriously nonfunctional buttons Elsewhere a short-sleeved asymmetrically hemmed jacket challenged the masculine codes from which it was drawn The croc cross straps on colorful rubber-clad platforms echoed the built-in cross-body suspenders that recurred throughout the collection while the houses newly boosted accessories team delivered some harmonious harmonica handbags and a tote so ingeniously colored that it seemed to be its own light source$$In June one year after the departure of founder Serge Cajfinger Paule Ka named a new creative designer Alithia Spuri-Zampetti The 31-year-old Central Saint Martins grad comes directly from a six-year stint at Lanvin where most recently she was the head designer of womenswear Market categories notwithstanding the leap in sensibility between the two brands isnt a huge one her background is probably very appealing for Paule Ka which occupies an untapped nichecall it accessible elegancebut lacks the cachet Spuri-Zampettis influence however will not be noticeable until next season which means the current collection represents a studio-designed placeholder And given the flux it came across as sure and steady Beyond the brands standby trapeze dress there were several other day-to-night variations each distinguished by some combination of polished fabric (crisp faille fluid cloque cotton tricotine) or punchy color (hibiscus sky blue citron) Everydayand every nightnovelty seemed to be the through line from pastel brocade outerwear to a loosely interpreted tuxedo-style strapless dress Bonus points if you identified the puzzle-piece pattern as MC Escher applied here and there to skirts dresses and knits it took a stronger stance than standard houndstooth But the strongest design of all was a flattering sheath slit from below the knee up each leg and fronted with a sculptural knot On the hanger it seemed sleek enough on the body it had a magic effect$$The Martini-drinking Los Angeles stylist Shirley Kurata was the driving force behind Peter Jensens Spring 2016 show today Jensen marked his 16th year in fashion and a return to the official London schedule with a no-holds-barred homage to Kuratas Pop Art sensibility Inspiration certainly struck from close quarters this season The eclectic stylist who has recently been responsible for the red carpet reinvention of Lena Dunham has worked on Jensens shows for some five years after the pair hit it off at Vogues Fashions Night Out in New York City  Jensens enduring affection for a 60s silhouette held fast this season It was embodied here in a mod secretary look that meshed with what he explained as a vintage 80s vibe This came through first and foremost in the fabricationwith cream skirt suits and shift dresses in toweling (a throwback to the designers time living in Hollywood that motherland of the velour tracksuit) but also in the cacti-stitched polo shirts The seasonless standouts were the pretty camera-print dresses worn over shirtingand the heavily sequined white socks and visors that finished every look Jensen took the idea of the muse to its outer reaches both with the sweater that read Shirley Shirley Shirley and the step-and-repeat print comprised of hundreds of faceless Shirleys This homage to the Tinseltown stylist was always going to have an emphasis on fun$$Heres a query about long flared culottes Granted they are being worn around the streets this season in their tailored form but will they have legs next season in lemon or pale blue semi-sheer seersucker Peter Pilotto took a gamble on them for Spring and on the evidence he provided the answer is Unlikely For the past few seasons Pilotto has been carefully orienting his collections in a way that moves him away from being defined as a print designer In this one he decided to concentrate mainly on solid colors and diaphanous texturesThe signature prints he made his name with were de-emphasized and reduced to graphic lines stamped with black on white circles and triangles that ran along segmented skirts The stronger part of Pilottos vision for Spring lay in his reprise of the midi-skirted silhouette he innovated a while back at a point when no-one else was thinking about that gracefully attenuated line That proved prescient and the continuation of that line which today appeared with tailored sleeveless wrap-over jackets worked to his advantage as did the dresses and skirts cut in pale layers of diaphanous lace Along the way Pilotto also picked up on some of the themes which are swirling in the fashion ether drawstring details tiered flounces and asymmetrical frills On the rack in stores all of those things will no doubt have appeal as high summer fare But do they stand out as recognizably Peter Pilotto Thats debatable Every young designer deserves the chance to develop but sometimes customers are reluctant to let go of what they found compelling about a label in the first place$$Get ready to hear a lot more about Phelan The new label by former Alexander Wang knitwear designer Amanda Phelan launched this afternoon with a bang The show seated theater style was led off by an extraordinary four-woman performance choreographed by Vim Vigor Dance Company founder Shannon Gillen and it concluded with the assembly onstage of models clad in some of the most innovative looks to come from a young New York designer in quite some time The rapturous applause was earned The dance wasnt just for show As Phelan explained movement is key to her brands identity and she wanted every element of her first collection and its presentation to speak to that theme Its plainest expression was via the knits which displayed a staggering level of technical invention There were knits popcorned and puckered ones gossamer sheer and others patterned in graphic intarsia The jaw-dropper was an accordion-knit silver dress that came off armor-like from a distance but was revealed to be pliable and lightweight when studied close-up Phelan was clearly stretching her knitwear muscles here but she spent the wealth of her Wang experience in another way too Aside from a few longeurs these were street-ready commercial looks Phelans movement theme also extended to the woven pieces It was evident in an abstract brushstroke print and in here-and-there fringe embellishment A long cotton skirt was slit up the front to accommodate a long stride and the blinding metallic pieces captured motion through light Phelan made and remade the same point but the sheer variety of ways she found to tell the same story kept the storytelling from feeling heavy-handed If anything the quibble here was that the looks the dancers wore also by Phelan werent included in the official runway collection The dancers high-waisted wide-leg cropped trousers demonstrated movement in the best way possiblethrough the furious aliveness of bodies$$As hundreds of hands simultaneously lifted their personal screens to ensure by-proxy digestion of the sight in front of their eyesCourtney Love in ripped jeans sliding down a mechanical runway singing to the backing of two glow-eyed Terminator-touched robot guitaristsit was easy to see Philipp Pleins point In his bare backstage office before this show wired on Red Bull and super-stressed in the expectation of imminent catastrophe he had observed Our life today is dominated by machines and electronic gadgets Like your phone is dominating your life and your navigation system is helping you to go from A to B Without our gadgets it is really hard these days for us to survive Which is true When that show started there were very few people in the audienceand certainly not mewho werent holding up their machines to prove their presence in the room Plein had decided to throw this Orwellian showthink Metropolis meets prt--porter meets Alexander McQueen Spring 99after watching the Alex Garlandscripted and directed film Ex Machina on a flight back to Italy from his second home in Los Angeles The idea he had was to use robots to equip the models as they proceeded on conveyer belts down the catwalk In stop-starts they moved forward as if on an assembly line and the industrial machines handed them their accessoriessunglasses handbags and the rest It was a show to chill the hearts of stylists everywhere  Yet when we met backstage Plein had just learned that two weeks of programming had crashed and the robots werent working He was kvetching hard-core Luckily some adroit IT specialistperhaps  someone turned the robots off then on againmeant that by showtime (only 52 minutes late) all was as planned Love bloomed forth sang her song and afterward the models made their chillingly passive progress down the runway The collection (oh yes) was an extension of the punk theme that Plein had plucked from the ether for his most recent menswear collection He is a pop designer and the clothes are pop too Many in fashion dismiss them as schlock but there is design behind these clothes apparent paucity of it Patched with fake album cover art and slogan badges and very often machine gunned with studs these were as maximalist-ly expressed as his theme They were obviouswhich is Pleins whole in-your-face MO  Not long afterward I found Love She was settling into her chair at the post-show dinner Asked if it was challenging to perform with robots she said Well I rehearsed just once and it was quite scary But actually the robots were very well behaved It was sliding down on the conveyorI had to rehearse that a few times And was that her most bananas fashion show experience ever No But its up there$$Lorenzo Serafini established himself as a dress man at his Philosophy debut for Fall 15 His second runway collection was very much an evolution of his first Victoriana by way of the 70s with a hint of the undone prairie girl Erdem Moralioglu covered similar ground in London but where his frocks had a special occasion sense of hauteur Serafinis dresses are designed to be lived in Wisps of floral-printed chiffon with tiny buttons left undone over lacy bits of lingerie paraded down the runway on glossy black cowboy booties beguiling in their offhandedness  David Hamiltons photography was on Serafinis mood board and like the famous lensman this designer idealizes the young A cropped crocheted sweater worn with hip-slung chambray trousers exposed acres of midriff broderie anglaise bloomers did the same for upper thighs Those shorts might get an airing at Fashion Week a year from now but otherwise theyre a nonstarter Elsewhere a cowhide leather coat seemed like a too-obvious nod to Serafinis Western theme As he settles into his new role hell learn to avoid that kind of runway pratfall Serafinis promise lies in his easy way with a silk dress from a pale mint drop-waist style to the lace inset slips and nightshirts with shorter-in-front and longer-in-back hems that ended the show Extrapolate on numbers like that and keep at the crafty knits he paired with them and hell be onto something$$Brava Phoebe English At her presentation today the up-and-coming designer began in earnest to deliver on her tremendous potential This was Englishs most fully fleshed-out collection to date filled with varied wearable pieces that expressed her distinctively dreamy point of view Displacement was the theme here imparted in everything from the askew cut of a simple camisole to the stutter effect of the three-layered pieces of fabric on the front of a flax-canvas sleeveless jacket English often talks about wanting her clothes to have a sense of immediacy a feeling she conveys via techniques that can come off as naive That sleeveless jacket though was one of the garments here that betrayed her sophistication as a designer The jacket was tailored through the back and the topmost piece of fabric layered in the front had a nattily finished blazer pocket Lots of designers play with deconstruction English was genuinely deconstructing Details like that jacket pocket werent the first things that jumped out at you about Englishs new clothes There was of course the signature handfuls of tulle that English applied to create her gauzy effects there were also sui generis embellishments like the rope-draped velvet frills that looked not unappealingly like scrunchies And English introduced some intriguing new textures here such as string embroidery and a material made by re-weaving torn-up strands of silk The re-woven silk pieces were a highlight of the collectionthe fabric itself was beautiful and English added to its expressiveness by leaving the ends of the silk ribbon dangling to create an irregular fringe The real development here though was in the collections accessibility Another highlight of this outing were the matter-of-fact culottes slashed on both legs near the hem The gesture of the slash sufficed to announce Englishs presence in the garment but you could easily imagine it as a mix-and-match go-to piece in a cool girls closet Ditto the slip-like silk skirts and those nicely askew camisoles English has gone a long way this season toward figuring out how to diffuse her voice through the kinds of items that make a wardrobe Expect more and better to come Thats not a lesson designers unlearn$$For the launch of Piazza Sempiones Spring collection the label again embraced a collaboration with the art world tapping R di Martino a talented Italian video artist whose emotional yet elegant visual language has been widely acclaimed She was commissioned to make a short film called A Day of Wonder shot in Marrakech and inspired by the cult movie Cat People a 1942 film noir depicting an exotic atmosphere full of danger and mystery Di Martino captured the sensuality of a lush Moroccan walled garden where a beautiful woman was lounging poolside Obviously she was clad in a Piazza Sempione cotton kaftanwhich she ditched pronto when after fluctuating lazily between dreams and reality and upon hearing a terrifying roar she jumped hurriedly into the pool for safety There she was surrounded by a surreal play of lights reflected on the water like a deceitful net The finale revealed the illusory nature of her fearsas well as the Moroccan inspiration of a collection which in an abundant stream ofreferences also mentioned a novel by the Moroccan writer Tahar Ben Jelloun Ideas from North African garb were translated into clean lines and comfortable shapes in a lineup where tunics capes and elongated dresses had an easy casual feel yet were elegant in their fluid simplicity Colors were warm and natural micro geometric patterns were inspired by zelliges the traditional colorful tiles adorning the walls of mosques and palaces They also served as the starting point for the digital work of artist Najia Mehadji whose pulsating images of flowers were reworked on printed silk poplin and duchesse$$Everyone says that the fashion business is changing For this reporters money the best evidence of the week so far came at Polo Ralph Laurens rooftop presentation where Selena Gomez (435 million Instagram followers) and Brooklyn Beckham (42 millionnot bad for a celebrity offspring) took in the tableaux vivant side by side Considering the access to all the eyeballs that millennial celebrities can provide a brand a journalist cant help but wonder if her kinds days are numbered  While I still have your attention a thought on the company and its new Spring collection Nobody knows their own brand better than Ralph Lauren knows his One season fashion leans minimal the next it sways vintage nerd-chic but Polos all-American style is eternal Exiting the stairwell into the bright sunshine of The McKittrick Hotels Gallow Green Gomez and Beckham were greeted by a denim grouping which produced two of the afternoons strongest looks a faded jumpsuit with metal hardware that was as slouchy as a three-piece denim suit was slim Section two had a Western flavor Fringe may be absolutely everywhere at the moment but let the record stand Lauren got there first  Group three is where Lauren turned on the brights tying the sleeves of a fuchsia cable-knit crew around the shoulders of a coral red minidress layering an electric orange schoolgirl blazer over a Bengal-stripe shirtdress and reuniting that definitive preppy combination of pink and green on a linen blazer and skinny jeans Floral-print sundresses were accessorized with floral-print bags of many different shapes and sizes By comparison the guys khaki suiting came off staid Classic isnt a bad thing when it comes to menswear but for the preppy peacock Lauren had a vibrant red firemans jacket$$Natasa Cagalj is a designer who believes in allowing her experiences as a woman a mother and a friend to other women to inform the way she designs The ideas for the collection she put together for Spring started she relatedwhile pulling out an oversize poplin top printed with circles and flowerswhen she was on the beach in Croatia this summer These are the simple potato prints my children made on holiday she said Im half Croatian half Slovenian and used to spend four weeks on the beach every year in Croatia as a girlI always used to bring ribbons and tape and paper and paints with me to make things just to stop myself being bored She smiled So now its a family tradition that me and my sister and all our children always do the same thing every year The sense of a lifestyle craftiness and do-it-yourself resourcefulness ran through the collection which was based around building a wardrobe of pinstriped shirting pieces pants knitwear soft tailoring and dresses Cagalj whose studio is in London says shed like to take the stress out of dressing for busy women who have work family and business travel to contend with I had this thought of how nice it would be to go to bed in your hotel room in your pajamas and bathrobe and maybe just get up and go out in them How many fashion women in a zombie state of tiredness at the shows will relate to that$$When a 79 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 of this year Kathmandu-raised Prabal Gurung mobilized quickly using his social media platforms to call for donations Since then about a million dollars have been raised for the quakes victims by the Shikshya Foundation Nepal on the board of which he sits Backstage tonight he was feeling gratitude If it wasnt for the fashion industry I wouldnt have been able to do it His show started with a thank-you some 30 monks clad in their traditional red and yellow robes hands clasped in prayer chanting The collection too had its roots in Nepal The work of artist Laxman Shreshtha who Gurung said he grew up studying became a jacquard on skin-baring evening separates the orange and yellow Holi powder hues of which formed the shows warm lit-from-within palette Last season Gurung took a turn for the minimal and he was on a similar path for Spring Simple pieces like a bias-cut chiffon column in pale yellow or a sleeveless black-and-white guipure lace sheath were the ones that resonated Gurung has a tendency to overembellish from time to timea printed dress with a skin-baring hand-tacked seam at the waist and another dress with a cluster of cutouts below its plunging neckline were two looks that wouldve benefited from a little more restraint By the end however he was in his groove The trio of body-skimming brightly colored finale gowns were stripped of all the extras They looked sensational$$Subverting traditional classics That was the line transmitted about the Prada collection by design director Fabio Zambernardi backstage in the absence of Miuccia Prada who was sadly unable to be there this season due to the passing of her aunt If Miuccia was elsewhere her aesthetic was fully present in a collection which literally stayed within narrow lines It was an essay on skirt suits and coats bisected with a graphic theme of vertical stripes and accompanied by a wealth of her quirky accessories signature embellishments and the swish of dozens of dangly earrings as big as Christmas-tree baubles The news from Milan so far has been about retro-eclecticism drawn through an Italian sensibility Well if anyone is the mother of all that it's Miuccia Prada who has been writing the encyclopedia on it with PhD-level footnotes and wittily allusive fashion-changing asides for decades This collection trod firmly on her home territory shod in an array of elegant low-heeled shoes each pair made in its own delicious configuration of pointiness ankle-strapping metallic leather patent and suede As for the suits they came in collages of checks tweeds and stripes sometimes in leather and suede here and there in transparent prints What to make of this For one thing Miuccia Prada pays no heed to weather-appropriateness In her viewwhich is a global onetheres as much need for pieced fur coats in summer as there is for skimpy silk slip dresses which she optionally layers over chunky knits Theres the question of proportions tooher loosened shoulder line and boxy shapes and a series of waist-length jackets in brown suede and leather could well prove influential The show ended with a siren call to Pradas wealthiest constituencies coats in metallic snakeskin and suede stripes and beautifully desirable organza suits and coats decorated with outsize transparent pailletted flowers One way or another all those looks are destined to be broken down and distributed as trophies all over the realms of young Hollywood the art world weddings and special occasions that Miuccia Prada knows so well$$Forecast Next summer will be about prettiness romance ruffles and laceor at least it will be for the portion of female humanity whos naturally into that But what if youre not Preen by Thornton Bregazzi is a collection that might meet you halfway Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi are a couple who know how to put an English edge on a ruffle and a flash of sex in a fluttery print frock Not surprising Theyre based in Notting Hill and started their business in the 90s in a concrete bunker under the overpass on Portobello Road Versed in the history of subversive alternatives as they are they can easily turn their hands to punk-ifying a Princess Diana Shy Di blouse with a couple of D-rings and straps or making that whole yoke and frill shape in startlingly erotic sheer black lace Thornton and Bregazzi said theyd been looking at contemporary dance particularly at Michael Clark and wanted a sense of beautiful romance in the collection The opening dress a dusty pink with sprigged flowers and a falling-off-shoulder line captured that fluidity of movement in a Stevie Nicks sort of waya trend thats continuing since the New York shows Then came a lot of slim lace dresses layered over short skirts which had cutout patches on the sleeves that had been re-appliqud with guipure flowers If they slightly trod on territory Christopher Kane mapped out at the beginning of his career and other moments brought back memories of some of Nicolas Ghesquires Balenciaga collections thats only a quibble Otherwise it was as always a confident showing of what their audience likes best$$A Georgian townhouse on Fitzroy Square was the serene setting for the first showing of Preen Lines Spring 2016 collection It was a chance for the designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi to indulge their magpie spirit with a series of vintage-inspired pieces that had their frequent stomping ground Portobello Market at heart Rainbows and flowers in satin stitch embroidery with more than a hint of the Haight-Ashbury hippie nodded to the 70s needlework of Ossie Clark It crept across the sleeves of a white double pleat denim jacket and onto a series of seriously desirable two-tone suede pieces that included a belted shirtdress and button-front A-line skirt Preen-staple floaty dresses were amplified with acidic yellow and pink checks on chiffon and stretch drill fabrics that hit a hard-edged punky note Once again the joy of Preen Line was in its ability to pull elements from countercultures and transform them into the kind of everyday essentials that smart hardworking woman want and need There was much for them to choose from in this sprawling 70-piece collection which overall was an altogether softer proposition than Fall though the graphic stripes that featured so heavily that season also found their way onto cropped sweatshirts and monochrome tank tops here A standout was the zigzag sweater which injected some much-needed West London glam into this quiet corner of Bloomsbury$$Although Massimo Nicosias press notes quoted him as saying this collection reflects an ethereal holiday in Scotland it would be highly inadvisable to pack these clothes for a real vacation in Braveheart territory Because seriously If you didn't freeze to death the midges would eat you alive That trifling quibble apart this was an often-lovely highly shootable potpourri of technically impressive work Nicosia is a percolator a thinker and this season he was trying to step back behind Pringle of Scotland's thick-knit lambswool curtain into more elemental territory The deep-V punched argyle intarsia in the debut look pointed to the rustication and sublimation ahead Rubberized string and leather tape were the fronds that twined below faux-naif floral details pinned to the chest and hip of faux-crochet (faux-chet) loose woven dresses Sliced panels of silk in diamond formation were more argyle salutations whilst the fishing-net open stitching was Nicosia's nod to the installation pieces of artist Ernesto Neto All this carefully wrought through-a-prism primitivism worked pragmatically in the net bags and stitched sandals To further entangle this collection's complicatedly knotted self-referential pitch at distillation that orange stitching was in fact digitally printeda computer-realized simulacrum of an artisan technique$$The things you hear backstage Tonight at Proenza Schouler Lazaro Hernandez declared We were looking at bananas things that peel away from the body The designer and his partner Jack McCollough turned out an audacious collection for Spring one that solidified their recent preoccupations with texture decoration and asymmetry and produced some of the most knockout dresses of the week Spain seemed to be a starting point what with the black white and red color palette the ruffles and the exposed shoulders and the pom-poms that traced the edges of dresses and jackets in broderie anglaise But this wasnt the straightforward interpretation of Spanish influences that Peter Coppings was at Oscar de la Renta last night Two shirtdresses that spilled off the shoulders (fashions current favorite erogenous zone) turned to reveal a crisscross of straps the hem of another dress was connected via a series of tied knots and the back was cut out of a knit dress with flamenco ruffles Tailored pieces were stripped of their closures velvet ribbons that looped through metal grommets and tied in bows kept patch-worked jacquard jackets and vests from falling open All of which brings us back to Hernandezs peeling bananas The Proenza boys have long been New York Citys most craft-obsessed young designers With a new investor announced earlier this year their ambitions are bigger than ever Here and there the details were overdoneseen all together those bows surely looked too busy But when they were on they were on Tops in our books was a series of narrow midi dresses with ruffles cutouts and fil coupe dots Feathered numbers made by shooting a rod through each quill to create a mesh grid were truly special As for accessories the pointy-toed mules with metal ring detailing lacing at the ankles and low mirrored heels rank right up there with the best of New York City too$$Creative director Kate Wendelborn may have recently left Protagonist but Spring found the hyper-soign label born of The Line in fighting form albeit with a slightly more conservative tenor The studio team hewed close to its aesthetic foundations clean lines immaculate fabrications and unfussy luxury The latter was paramount for Spring straight out of the gate to wit a spare robe coat in buttery suede andwait for ita chocolate croc bolero A piece like that might easily feel anachronistic downright patrician even but in the closet of the Protagonist woman (sitting as it no doubt does alongside tattered 501s and white tees) it reads as a serious statement Itll team dreamily with one of this seasons lookbook shoe stylesBirks  la Blahnik good enough to make you pray theyll make it into production Their androgynous appeal was echoed in rakish pajama tops which borrowed a classic mens shape and added a simple tie to cinch the waist  A grouping of straightforward black nylon jackets came up strong on utilitarianism still theyd hardly have been missed within this generally singular lineup Shirting an emphasis for the brand from day one was as covetable as ever with pieces alternately crisp and louche with wide cuffs or with shawl collars and delicate button detailing Those closures were equally effective on a slit-to-there pencil skirt which was risqu without being showy and evocative to boot$$The pressures on for Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne The Public School designers unveil their debut collection for DKNY in a few days time and it was reasonable to expect that the duos need to deliver for their new corporate masters would result in a Public School show that looked well distracted Instead Chow and Osbornes DKNY assignment seems to have prompted them to think even harder about Public School and how to bring the brands clothes a real sense of elevation A sophisticated tone was set with the first pair of looks two streetwise yet soign ensembles that featured terrific softly pleated palazzo pants Here at last was the payoff for all the effort Chow and Osborne have put in the past few seasons to bring more dimension and fluidity to their womens looks And indeed the highlights of this collection found them exploring dimension and fluidity with a fresh sense of fluency Those qualities were there in spades in for instance a chic belted gilet of sand-toned raffia multiple parachute-inspired coats and the silky maxi dresses that read as a sporty take on that lean Haider Ackermann silhouette The latter looks didnt read as derivative They did however feel grown up Chow and Osborne said after the show that they were imagining the Public School girl gone abroad on far-flung travels seeking to find herself Thats a grab bag of a concept one that invites a lot of drift and where Chow and Osborne faltered here was in the looks that digressed from the collections overarching urban-nomad vibe A tennis sweateresque knit dress for instance seemed out of sync with the rest of the show ditto the sculpted wrap skirts and button-downs with graphic contrast piping The designers werent wrong to want to interrupt the parade of diaphanous looks with something a little sharper but they did that to better effect when they introduced say slender ribbed tunics with tonal horizontal stripes Those pieces expressed the signature Public School geometry but elegantly and with understatement If thats what comes of turning up the pressure on Osborne and Chowbring it on$$Was a new Wes Anderson flick filming at The Plaza Hotel this morning No it was just that Rachel Antonoff had taken over The Plazas storied Palm Court to stage her labels fantastical Spring presentation A branch structure encircled the rooms central bar and the plush carpets were strewn with torn paper pinecones Coleman lamps and the like All around were exquisite 3-D paper birds With a theme of birding Antonoff envisioned the seasons protagonist Edith Finch a slightly dotty (if not downright deranged) woman We dont know if its all in her head Antonoff offered She might be the only person at camp There was also a dose of Troop Beverly Hills The set was an ultra-involved imagining of what the Womens Aviary Society Annual Birding Weekend might look like In keeping with the quietly sinister undertone models posed casually with say an ax (more Misery than Troop BH) or a bow and arrow Whats more one of those paper birds came shot bleeding tiny crimson paper droplets There were sweet Carmen Mirandaesque fruit prints itty-bitty cropped novelty T-shirts (Tiny Tee read a particularly meta one) and 50s-style frocks The camp/birding themes hit their zenith in the counselor get-upskhaki colored with all manner of ornithological flair The chickadee patches were darling but there was an authoritarian dowdiness to those pieces that may make them a tough sell for Antonoffs clientele What theyll go gaga for is the pure 90s slip dress in a candy-colored pastel floral jacquard and the eyelet column gown$$This was a watershed moment Tonights Rachel Comey dinner-cum-show at Pioneer Works in Red Hook unfolded a little differently than ones past As opposed to filing out in a series of looks between courses Comeys models came out once this evening en masse And most of them werent models at least not in the sense that the term is usually understood These were dancers of varying ages colors and sizes from the robbinschilds company with which Comey collaborated on a video presentation for Resort They were fitted in characteristically easy-going looks that suited each womans shape and as they took their leisurely turns down the ersatz runway between the dinner tables they asserted an aura of self-possession and authority The dancers looked like interesting stylish women you might encounter on the street That was Comeys point of courseto validate the reality of her clothes rather than setting them up as a fantasy that potential customers might wish to enter into Many people in the audience said afterwards that they were moved It seems a bit glib after that coup de thetre to talk about individual pieces But Comeys collection did underscore her themethe emphasis was on fabrics that felt soft and looked lived in experienced somehow To wit the stonewashed velvet that Comey used in slouchy suits and one excellent duster-length trench and the vegetable-dyed leathers and emphatically distressed denim A sense of things being in process pervaded the collections shapes as well These were fitted closer to the body in general than Comey is usually wont to do but they frequently featured dangling scarf-like hems or other kinds of asymmetries to create dimension and dynamism There were standout pieces alongside that velvet trench and sundry details worth calling out but they all served Comeys larger point which was to validate the fact that these clothes were made for living Which is a thing that real interesting women do$$After a turning point for Rachel Zoes eponymous line back in Resort you hoped the designer and her team would be able to keep up their momentum in reviving the formerly fatigued label And at yesterday's presentation they generally succeeded At the risk of sounding like a broken record in characterizing the mega-stylists design sensibilities her woman doesnt vary too much from season to season even if the locale does periodically (Morocco or Carnaby Street) gypset luxe with a Bianca Jaggeresque ratio of uptown polish and downtown bohemia Zoes clothes continue to take on a more aspirational quality Spring's tasseled suede topper felt a long way from the parade of filmy pussy-bow blouses from seasons gone by There was a sense of luxury to it and to pieces like a beaded and fringed vest in cream-color upholstery or the tasseled suede toppers The designers suiting meanwhile was more compelling than ever before Opulently slouchy pajama styles stole even the heart of this Fashion Weekweary reporter A few looks felt superfluous the diaphanous yellow maxi dress was surely nice and shoppable but perhaps not distinctive enough to warrant its place in the runway edit Nevertheless this collection was another savvy step in the reinvigoration of the Rachel Zoe brand$$Did it make any difference that Rag & Bone decided to show in Brooklyn Not in the sense of having any material effect on the pictures you see here in which the background and lighting are indistinguishable from any other professional production in New York Yet theres a yearning among many designers now to get back to some feeling of authenticityor rather any feeling at all that takes people out of the usual show rut And in the case of Rag & Bone designers David Neville and Marcus Wainwright that meant deciding to invite their audience to partake of something privately meaningful to them on both the local and the stylistic levels to wit a collection that re-channeled the 90s of the designers youth and in a community arts center St Anns Warehouse which they both revere as a stage graced by Lou Reed and other members of the Velvet Underground generation A swift read out in terms of clothes revealed slightly different reference points though Backstage Wainwright said that the midi tube dresses and hoop earrings were derived from his memories of going to the Notting Hill Carnival in London in the late 90s and all the army-surplus references to MA-1 jackets parkas and ribbed sweaters came from the huge collection of military clothes Ive had since before we even began this thing Add in some slip dresses technorave sportswear mesh and track pants and there you have it The truth is that the Rag & Bone guys are of course English They came to the United States and made it on a commercial scale which would never have been possible on British resources in such quick order Now Wainwright is so deeply embedded in New York that he sees Brooklyn where he lives as home Inviting his audience to drive out to visit his adopted neighborhood at nine at night was no big ask in his mind but more of an act of solidarity with a community Giving back is always good$$USRL 1967 the patch on a white shirt announced Jessica Chastain Julianne Moore and the rest of us were transported oceanside at Ralph Laurens show this morning To use a maritime expression the designer found his sea legs for Spring Accessories ranged from captains hats to souvenir straw bags to the sort of cork platforms you see in resort towns As for the clothes they hewed to the RL standards preppy yacht-clubbing essentials in a vivid all-American color palette and cable sweaters draped over shoulders or wrapped around waists Amid the large offering of navy and tan leather jackets there was at least one of his de rigueur double-breasted blazers The seafaring theme was particularly hard to miss in a series of looks in a super-bold geometric sail print This was one of Laurens most literal-minded collections in some time but if the designer and his styling team mightve used a lighter touch to convey the seasons crisp sporty message piece by piece there were great clothes A color-blocked sleeveless jumpsuit had the graphic punch of nautical flags Clingy knit dresses that took cues from athletic swimsuits looked like theyd be fun to wearin particular the evening versions with their sexy strappy backs And who doesnt love a striped knit Speaking of stripes the stars of the show were the evening dresses in cotton broadcloth shirting fabric haute silhouettes in a humble fabric$$Whos Raquel Allegras biggest fan Judging from the designers New York Fashion Week debut a whole lot of women Thursdays presentation drew a buzzing crowd and women from top boutique buyers to a radiant Marisa Tomei grabbed her for selfies Despite years of showing her collections only on an appointment basis Allegra is a well-established presence in the industry and yesterday was vivid testimony to that fact Allegras work has always been heavily marked by the bohemian and Spring found her embracing it wholly Models stood at the edges of a floral mandala created by close friends of the designer and a psychedelic soundtrack (the 13th Floor Elevators anyone) was piped in over the system  Recent seasons have found the designer expanding her purview integrating other materials into her signature vernacular of supple jersey denim lace leathereven some rabbit fur for Resort Likewise there was a lot of newness to be had here floral separates and dresses in a more conspicuously print-y print than shes shown in past something for the guys (a Spring mens capsule will be available exclusively at Barneys) and wait for itfootwear Coolest were a pair of leather slip-ons that Allegra dubbed the baby of a creeper and a ballet flat In a lot of ways that was an apt description for the seasons offering on the whole Allegras got an evident romantics soul but some of the best pieces here were the ones that spoke to a punkier edge and pushed her established boundaries a bit Take the sheer layering pieces in her trademark cobwebby shredding or a short-sleeved fringe leather jacket shown with a top and wide-leg trouser in a murky green and black stripe She may be a big proponent of oversized pieces but Allegra surely knows her way around great soft tailoring$$One gets the feeling that Rebecca Minkoffs customer might be most familiar with the designers seasonal muses from say a Pinterest board Still if Minkoff can turn on her young clientele to the likes of Patti Smith or Franoise Hardy as some of the icons she's envisioned through her kicky clothes more power to her For Spring the inspiration was Marianne Faithfull whom Minkoff discussed backstage in terms of both her sweetness and her rebelliousness The designer nodded to that duality with her color story opening the collection with a parade of virginal ivory cream and bone which soon gave way to plenty of black The Minkoff girl at her baddest (and coolest) came in an homage to Faithfull as seen in The Girl on a Motorcycle a lightened-up take on the black leather jumpsuit she wears in the film Shapes here were a mishmash of the Mod (a sweet suede shift) and the bohemian (maxi tank dresses with a nice flyaway sleeve detail) The hemlines were short and the designers footwear of choicea pared-back knee-high gladiator with colored Lucite heelscame up long on appeal$$One reason Rebecca Taylor is a highlight among contemporary designers is that she trusts her instincts Rather than reinterpret last seasons trends or cobble together an obscure reference she taps into what women are craving whether its a Victorian neckline or something less defined like a freer more experimental approach to getting dressed For Spring she was feeling midi lengths baby boot-cut pants and less volume overalldetails that feel right this season but you cant quite put your finger on why A-line skirts skimmed the hips before gently flaring out and off-the-shoulder dresses with big ruffles flattered the arms they were the kind of pieces that draw you to the rack because theyre pretty not because they reference a particular decade or mood  Taylor is known for her eccentric feminine prints and this season she indulged her love of the Bloomsbury Group a collective of English artists philosophers and writers from the early 1900s She flipped through a heavy coffee-table book and pointed out paintings and drawings that were mirrored in the collections rich florals Several looks had different prints patchworked together as if she couldnt choose a favorite a V-neck ankle-length dress with capped sleeves was a real standout$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli swapped Seattle for the Petit Trianon this season And given the designers penchant for embroideries and point desprit Marie Antoinette proved to be a much more natural inspiration than Kurt and Courtney While Falls grunge references came off somewhat literallywho looks to Red Valentino for a lumberjack shirt after allthese riffs on eighteenth-century styling seemed more subtle Take the ruffled corsetry which lent a new insouciant charm to the jumpsuit a popular silhouette that has been in need of a refresh Since taking the reins at this label Chiuri and Piccioli have made all things A-line their signature The hourglass corsets count as genuine news for the duoreason enough to give this little sister line a closer look for Spring The real stars of the collection though were the cap-sleeve slightly empire-line dresses in delicate layers of lace hand-embroidered with wildflowers or beaded here and there with small birds We expect to see Hollywoods young royals in them all awards season long$$Reem Acra a Lebanon native wanted to show who she was in this collection by combining her past and present life Acra tied the two together quite literally by using the belt as a jumping-off point I was going to flea markets all over the world and collecting belts off of people she said The accessories had intricate nods to traditional Middle Eastern beading and were embedded into short dresses highlighting the midsection for a nice bloom-at-the-waist emphasis The detail became a figure-complementing necessity with pieces like a floral-print V-neck dress with a tulle overlay that cascaded over the shoulders as well as an orange scoop-neck shirt paired with a twisted aqua skirt While most of the belts seemed plucked straight from a bazaar in Beirut not everything was quite as homage paying There was an almost bohemian through-the-looking-glass version that was common in the 60s That factor came through in a metallic-whipped dress with poet sleeves patterned with paisleys doused in a groovy palette of lime greens lavenders and pinks A strappy thigh-skimming chiffon dress was slathered in midnight blue sequins and had dcolletage that dipped into the waist  But it was the floor-skimming gowns that were Acras strong point and they fully exemplified her meticulous attention to detailthose were full of far-flung romantic flou A crimson robe dress secured with a metal-looking clasp belt had strips of emerald beading that lined the opening eventually curving around the neck for a sliver of sex appeal while a caftan gown with gold edging and bright red embroidered florals injected a dose of modesty Both versions would be nice to see on the red carpet this coming awards season$$Its easy to think about fashion at the surface level What makes us feel comfortable beautiful powerful sexy Most people dont go beyond that to consider how the current state of culture affects their wardrobes but it plays a big part in what we buy Rie Yamagata for example doesnt approach design with a specific theme or dramatic twist in mind she just wants to make clothes that cool girls would wear in New York City Tokyo and everywhere in between She thinks about what women crave and more importantly why we crave it Her starting point for Spring 2016 was the Southwest but she couldnt quite put her finger on how she got there I think with all the technology happening right now I just wanted everything to feel natural she said We used a lot of natural silks that feel so good against the body I didnt want to use many synthetics  Words like crafty and artisanal were thrown around the presentation space a lot You could think of them as the inverse of selfie and wearable tech A cream silk georgette gown with black trim had the potential to be the perfect one-step summer party uniform while nubby jacquard jackets and skirts with unfinished hems lent a bit more structure Even the prints felt just slightly undonea poppy floral was vaguely surreal on a wide-leg jumpsuit and a few silk dresses featured a blown-up pixel weave print that mimicked fuzzy plaid and houndstooth But one of the simplest pieces managed to sum up the collection best A sleek ivory column with a hand-knotted macram placket was equally suited for day and night and nailed that easy yet special balance that feels so fresh right now$$In a recent interview actress Carey Mulligan complained about the fact that the characters she plays are often described as strong women That label she said makes it seem as though strength in a woman is the exception not the norm And it rubs her the wrong way Its not uncommon to experience a similar frisson backstage at a fashion show when a designer says that his (or her) collection pays tribute to strong womenthe message is always well meant but by setting up strength as a quality found only in a particular type of woman it demeans the fairer sex as a whole At his latest show Rick Owens put paid to that way of thinking Owens latest coup de thtre wasnt a tribute to strong women it was a tribute to female strength Thats a major distinction Chanteuse Eska who performed last year with Owenss wife Michle Lamy at the Meltdown Festival in London presided over this evenings proceedings singing the theme song from the film Exodus As she sang models exited in new Rick Owens lookssome of which like the sleeveless dusters and crinkled anoraks registered as atypically accessible silhouettes while others such as the short dresses collaged from canvas and leather reiterated Owenss signature sculptularity in a new almost dreamlike tone Periodically the dfil was interrupted by an incredible sight a woman dressed by Owens carrying another woman down the long length of the runway Their bodies were yoked together sometimes the women being carried hung upside down legs slung over their partners shoulders Other women were strapped on like backpacks Speaking before the show Owens said hed been thinkingwondering reallyabout the ways women nurture others metaphorically taking on another human beings weight That inquiry was communicated forcefully by the shows staging The carrying women with their human freight also suggested the physical labors of pregnancyan undercurrent amplified by the Owens silhouettes featuring distended volumes that were almost carbuncular When the last model crossed the catwalk wearing a short dress and one of those terrifically commercial crinkled anoraks she looked sublimely unburdeneduntil you noted the straps crisscrossing the jacket in back Even the most sylph-like seemingly footloose and fancy-free woman is prepared at any moment to shoulder a weight That at any rate appeared to be Owenss message in making those load-bearing straps his shows closing image All women are strong Even the ones who dont know it yet$$Peter Dundas has a reputation as a classy designer In his varied career hes proven his talents at Emanuel Ungaro (doing haute Parisian) Revillon (fur) and Emilio Pucci (sexy rock-chick dressing) Now Dundas has circled back to Roberto Cavalli the house where he began his careerand where incidentally Balmains Olivier Rousteing was once his assistant Over the past couple of years the competition among labels to capture the imagination of a new generation has resulted in a remarkable changing of the guard The domino effect started with Hedi Slimanes democratizing youth-cult-y success at Saint Laurent it flowed on through Alessandro Micheles eclectic vintage-y takeover at Gucci and most recently it hit New York putting Public School in charge at DKNY For his Cavalli comeback Dundas has handled the commercial situation by sidestepping the haute and embracing street and nightclub-wear with an 80s spin The result skimpy body-con dresses high-waisted animal-print jeans and leggings sleeveless biker jackets bandeau tops tied in pouf-y bows on one shoulder and prom skirts trailing giant frilled trains in their wake There is nothing wrong with tinkering with 80s styling per seMiuccia Prada Jonathan Anderson and Christopher Kane are all dab hands at playing with Princess Di yoked collars pumped-up Gloria von Thurn und Taxis leg-of-mutton sleeves and jangling Christian Lacroix-meets-Memphis color and pattern Theres a fine line of irony though which divides the intriguingly kitsch from the literal and cheap looking Dundas was on sure ground when he tailored leather into neat jackets and sexy pants these showed his long-standing expertise as a cutter and fitter for beautiful young girls bent on having a good time But Dundas still needs to find that difficult balance between accessibility and designer leadership He has all the talent and experience it takes and a huge swath of friends and goodwill following him His track record suggests that by next season hell have it figured out$$Gala Dal wife of Salvador was Alessandro DellAcquas muse for Spring Shes a fitting inspiration for the designer who has imbued his version of Rochas with whimsy and hyperbole Both were in evidence in his new Spring collection which featured torso-spanning bows beaded giraffe embroideries and shiny retro bras and briefs (patent plastic) underneath lace dresses And that was just DellAcqua getting stared There were also jailhouse stripes on a pinafore dress an Alessandro Michele for Gucci pantsuit moment and anachronistic graphic tees layered under clouds of white organza Not unlike his No 21 collection in Milan last week this Rochas outing strained under the weight of all DellAcquas ideas Thats too bad because there were gems in the mix like the loose-fitting slip dresses he cut in several different fabrics prettiest of all a colorful jacquard over which he layered delicate black Chantilly lace A quick scan of the top e-commerce sites suggests DellAcquas Rochas is a popular label but the buys tend to be significantly more conservative than what he showed on the runway today Among the things that made it to the catwalk that were sure to see online are the eccentric but easy-on-the-feet lace skimmers$$Sometimes I feel like its futuristic to go into the past Sometimes fashion quotes like that one from Kate Mulleavy seem to make little sensebut what she was talking about after the beautifully feminine Rodarte show was the powerful effect of taking time to read poetry and then seeing how it works on your creativity She and her sister Laura spent the summer immersing themselves in Elizabeth Barrett Browning Emily Dickinson and Leonard Cohen while listening to Electric Light Orchestras early synthesized sparkly music It seems to have put them into a kind of a 70s-nostalgic trance from which their best collection in a long time proceededa kind of soft glam-rock tenderly sewn into immensely intricate lace dresses trailing long silk scarves and an aura of Old Hollywood glitter in its wake Whatever therapy reading poetry offers the soul it seems to have refocused the Mulleavys on what they do best and believe in most giving them the heart to fully concentrate on the art of dressmaking which has always been at their fingertips but has at times drifted from their grasp in the crosscurrents of other pop-cultural seasonal notions This time though their promise was realized in a head-spinningly light and complex series of collages of lace velvet embroidery beading and silk fringing cut into Victoriana bodices and swinging gently out from small waists to touch the knee Such lavish techniques can easily lead to heaviness or a sense of inauthentic costumey-ness but this was a fully realized and believable fashion look Down to the black lacy tights down to the truly enviable gold silver and colored suede Deco shoes it read as a young womans interpretation of what it might take to have a really good night out on the town non-uptight dressing for maybe dancing and lounging languidly around on couches who knows where It wasnt all dresses either What with the floppily louche lam pantsuits big shearling chubbies and some sexy bugle-beaded miniskirts with flower appliqus curving dangerously upward in the front this was a collection that achieved the range that has also eluded the Mulleavys till now Did it move fashion on Probably not But as far as Rodarte is concerned looking to its own past brought out what will stick in memory as one of the most soulfully authentic collections in New York$$Since moving to New York City from Sweden Carin Rodebjer has like many of her fellow city-dwellers developed an obsession with space Not outer spacethat was the theme of Rodebjers fine Fall 2015 collectionbut space in general and having enough of it to move around in This season she translated the obsession into clothes that emphasized movement The theme was iterated in various waysdiaphanous silk dresses kimono-shaped jackets and blouses culottes made for a long stride Eyelash fringe underscored the collections sense of motion as well as adding to its rich sense of texture so did fabrics like a white silk dappled in silver meant to catch and throw back the light  Silhouettes erred toward the long and the lean but never so much that the looks came off as in any way constrictive and the languid tone was echoed in the palette which moved through rustic earth tones to oceanic blues There was an element of pop however The monochromatic collage prints in sandwashed silk were designed by Rodebjers longtime friend the artist Liselotte Watkins The prints geometries though soft helped to provide the clothes with a sense of urbanity one characteristic of Rodebjers oeuvre For all its vacation-y ease this was a city-dwellers collection after all$$Geometric sculptures dotted the runway like jigsaw puzzles at Roksanda Ilincics show this morning giving clues to her new collection Cutouts and asymmetry have been recurring themes on the runways this season and the designer was thinking along those lines for Spring too The show opened with one of her signature floor-length A-line dresses which was covered with an Abstract Expressionistinspired pattern but first signs of a more off-center approach came through in a ruffle that snaked along the leg of cropped trousers That idea reappeared in more recognizable puzzle-like pieces such as in a sweeping canary yellow and black dress that was cut with keyhole peepholes Those somewhat tricky experiments in proportion made way for a more fluid silhouette and the simpler slip dresses in shades of blush baby blue yellow and black were the most convincing looks hereand right in line with the softer romantic mood of the season With her mille-feuille shredded chiffon dresses that closed the show Ilincic took her voluminous aesthetic in an interesting new direction It would likely require a statuesque beauty like Ilincic herself though to pull them off on the red carpet$$Roland Mourets Galaxy dress turns 10 this year There have been times during the last decade when Mouret has worked hard to distance himself from that sublime frock even as the media has never let him forget about it Today he made a celebration of it sending the models out for their finale in a rainbow coalition of Galaxy dresses to the delight of the crowd Designers feel untold pressure to innovateMouret includedand in the endless quest for something new hes occasionally made dresses too complicated for their own good with origami-like nipping and tucking at the waistline The patternmaking has been fairly virtuosic and the hourglass fit sexy yet the finished product has at times felt overwrought Mouret avoided that mistake here opting to explore color and print rather than fabric manipulation and fixating on the shoulders as a new erogenous zone In keeping with one of the major trends of the season there were a handful of cold shoulder dresses but he made a point of variety also showing a crisscrossing spaghetti-strap cocktail dress a fluttery black halter top that descended into a midi-length white skirt and one-shoulder knits worn with knee-length skirts for a daytime appeal As for that color and pattern Mouret took an inclusive approach offering classic navy on the one hand and bright saffron and mint-green on the other The most innovative print was actually a laser-cut floral motif on a pair of skirts The program notes announced a capsule collection of pieces made in the Galaxy dresss image Theyre already available for sale on the Roland Mouret website We have a feeling theyll be getting lots of clicks tomorrow$$Rosetta Getty stumbled onto her inspiration this season She was at the Getty Center checking out the Jackson Pollocks and happened to notice museum workers installing the show Yvonne Rainer Dances and Films That got her thinking about postmodern danceits expansiveness and its naked expressivenessand about the aesthetics of the dance world in general Getty extrapolated the dance theme pretty directly here and to very appealing effect She emphasized fluid silhouettes that could accommodate movement whether in calf-length skirts and dresses with trumpet silhouettes or fine rib tees with a leotard-like fit or trousers with a pajama sense of ease There were also lots of openings and slits often created via apron-ish ties Wrapping and tying were already idiomatic to Getty but she nicely updated her vocabulary this season The apron-style tunics open at the side and white satin wrap dress piped in black were two particularly strong looks As usual much of the beauty of Gettys collection was to be found in her fabrics For example the crepe she used is you have to believe the very best crepe The excellence of its hand-feel cant really be imparted in words or photos but a glance at Gettys taupe V-neck gown hints at its terrific drape Likewise the cotton poplin she used in her charming flounced off-the-shoulder tops was paradigmatically light and crispy and the georgette of a black cape-sleeved gown was Platonically silky One of Gettys grace notes was her tonal textural adaption in luxe white viscose of the paisley print seen elsewhere in silk Her trousers and wrapped tunic top in the viscose fused pliancy and authority in much the way a top-notch dancer does Getty did her stumbled-on inspiration proud$$Rosie Assoulin is having a good time The bonhomie is self-evident in her clothes which often come off as immaculately crafted surrealist jokes Assoulin isnt as sly or pointed as Elsa Schiaparelli was at least not yet but shes working in the same playful vein This season for instance she traded in the dirigible-size gowns for which shes been known and focused instead on recontextualizing the most casual of wear to wit bathing suits pajamas and underwear The undies were boxers poking out of slouchy twill pants theyd been sewn into the pajama-inspired looks came bedazzled in grids of tiny Swarovski crystals or more slinky yet were executed in iridescent crystal mesh Swimsuits meanwhile offered Assoulin numerous opportunities to have funtriangle tops as daywear candy-color bikini bottom ties as embellishment on a cocktail dress magnified ties cinching the sides of pantsand she parried those riffs with mariner-inspired looks Workingman and vacationing lady meet at the waters edge A romantic comedy by Rosie Assoulin As far as the evening looks went Assoulin didnt entirely jettison her penchant for volume and exaggeration this season but she did rein it way way in There were gowns and long skirts that spread out from the hip in godet pleats and formal tops with Mannerist sleeves But the designer seemed more turned on by the subtler elements here like the snaps that allowed a one-shoulder pink frock to shape-shift if the wearer so desired or those bedazzled crystal grids Assoulin is finding new outlets for her sensibility in other words and relying less on operatic effects Surely Schiap would approve$$Ryan Lo expressed his yen for maximalist cutesiness through a series of treacly-sweet tropes of Valentines schtick anime superheroes and fairy-tale archetypes in this tasty sugar rush of a collection The frills kept coming frolicking up jersey socks trousers and dresses cavorting hither and thither in crema whorls against printed jersey Heaped-on jewelry and lost-in-the-forest mussed-up hair added entirely unnecessary but hey-why-not drama and flash  Acid pick-and-mix intarsia knits with punctuations of knot were the looser sometimes anguish-touched exhalations There were heaps of craft passion aplenty and reams of reference that Los note writer Susie Lau reported featured sweet Kiki from Hayao Miyazakis Kikis Delivery Service and the kawaii witches from Ryans childhood faves Sugar Sugar Rune and Magical DoReMi Harajuku heaven$$Some designers drift from season to season looking for a current mood or muse to propel their vision onward Others like Ryan Roche find that the best way to move their label forward comes by returning to a consistent highly personal aesthetic In Roches case that means a veritable obsession with softness a delicate palette (with a particular fondness for the palest shade of blush) and what can only be called coziness Thats not to say that her clothes arent forward-thinking With her latest collection she continued to marry a finely wrought fashion sensibility with a real commitment to ease As far as starting points the look of nineties minimalism and ballerinas in rehearsal was percolating in Roches minds eye for Spring The overall effect was more languid than you would expect from a dancers working uniform though and a cream robe and slightly oversize ribbed pink sweater would make for luxurious pieces to roll around in on a lazy Sunday afternoon  These days that casual yet luxurious approach to everyday dressing appeals beyond the weekend and Roches laid-back elegance speaks to the way many women want to dress right now That her popular cashmere sweaters came with subtle modern twistsan asymmetric ruffle here a belted waist therewas all the more reason to fall for them (or more specifically wrap up in them) Its been a year since Roche was named a runner-up in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition and its clear from her latest collection that shes headed in the right direction$$Sacais Chitose Abe landed a Nike collaboration earlier this year and her name has come up as a possible candidate for the open creative director job at Balenciaga Wed put her clothes in the top handful of most visible brands on the street style scene and shes become highly influential for other designers So whats the problem Easy Abes level of popularity breeds familiarity and as tempting as it may be to stick with what sells shes also aware that she must move on to maintain the level of enthusiasm and support shes lately enjoyed  Her niche has been the concept of hybrids Abe will combine a sweater and a button-down shirt a tweed blazer with a biker jacket or a kilt with a flowing chiffon skirt For Spring the idea was to push things further Its not only about hybrids but about distortion to get new shape her right-hand man Daisuke Gemma said afterward We worked very hard That much was clear The foundations were familiarvintage shop souvenir scarves bandanas Peruvian blanketsbut where they ended up was somewhere way way beyond basic These were audaciously complex clothes constructed from many layers and with a sense of disarraystraps spilling suggestively off shoulders slashed waistbands falling slack at the hipsintentionally built in  It was chaotic just like Paradise Garage was back in the day (The New York City 80s clubs logo tees appeared here as they did in her mens collection back in June) But it was controlled chaos Abe belongs to an elite group of the most ingenious designers working today The navy and gold floral pieces (not lace she pointed out backstage but embroideries with the negative space laser-cut away) are about to become as ubiquitous as all of the Sacai pieces outside the shows today$$It used to be you could get away with buying one good dress for an entire social season But with the advent of social media notable outfits are made to be documented and sharedmaking the economics of re-wearing garments slightly more problematic for the Instagram set Babi Ahluwalia who along with her husband Sachin founded Sachin & Babi said this year she visited several trade shows and spoke directly to a number of customers who expressed anxiety over re-wearing evening gowns after posting images of their outfit on social media At the same time they told the designer they couldnt justify spending thousands of dollars on a dress theyd wear only once Respecting this new digital landscape the Ahluwalias paid extra attention this season to evening separates that can be mixed and matched Strapless trapeze tops in frothy white eyelet or printed chiffon could be worn with a matching skirt or with pants to create an entirely new look (and entice a few double taps no doubt) The designers were also mindful of the price tag Everything in the collection is under $1000 except a hand-embroidered layer cake of a dress that hovers around $1200 and had enough technical detail to warrant the added cost Those were the most exciting offerings from the brand Less so were the more straightforward cocktail dresses though the couple still found a way to add interest by way of off-the-shoulder necklines and bold abstract floral prints$$Commercially Hedi Slimane has no more to prove with what hes set out to do at Saint Laurent In a word selling His thorough refurb from advertising to video to music connections to multiple lines of product has turned Saint Laurent into a power brand More than that the success of his breaking down the house and rendering it into accessible uncomplicated items has set off a chain reaction at the top of the designer fashion industry Heads have been rolling and new ones put in place all over Milan New York and Paris as corporations scramble to cast talents they pray will be able to replicate Slimanes magic touch with multiproduct marketing With Alessandro Micheles appointment at Gucci the process has been working at speed but in some other places there are bandwagons still stuck in the garage  Not everyone can package up a look and whack it to the public in such a first-degree widely understandable and Zeitgeist-savvy way as Slimane For Spring one glance at the lowbrow tiaras the sparkly see-through mini-mesh dresses the rock-chick leather jackets and the skinny legs of the models shoved into Wellington boots told us where he was going To Glastonbury with Courtney and Kate it was with an entourage of throwback shaggy-headed waifs and a caravan-load of ready-made vintage-y stuff  Slimane was smart to suggest he was pitching it in a more down-to-earth way this season There is a movement toward real ordinary clothes going on largely triggered by the left-of-field rise of the Vetements collective which ingeniously repurposes generic garments Slimane seemed to have tuned into that when he came up with a perfectly ordinary beige trenchcoat sand-color camisole jeans and black Wellingtons a faded army-surplus shirt patchworked denim capes and leather bomber jackets that looked as if they could have been trawled from racks at the cheap end of Portobello Market Say what you like about whether this is actually design there is a skill in making a familiar-looking garment fit well and come off as generic enough to be absorbed into a girls wardrobe and Saint Laurents sales have shot up because of it  Still the grunge and glitter theme also gave Slimane the key to turning out his more special things too loads of variations on the bias-cut slip dress in metallic sequins or velvet patchwork liquid gold charmeuse or black silk plus glam fur and feather chubbies Finally though there is only one litmus test which will make this or any collection sell Is the girl on the runway someone other girls want to be Slimanes good at pushing classic youth-cultural buttons but in his casting the one thing hes not in touch with is the fact that todays young girls want to look at other girls who represent the way they look How long will it take for designers to realize how badly theyre cutting their own chances by not reflecting that$$Sally LaPointe is best known for her super-luxe knitsthink simple pullovers with fox-fur sleeves and plush cashmere-wool turtlenecks with just enough slouch Cozy textures are her thing but since its easier to experiment with pony hair leather and merino during the Fall season Spring always presents a challenge for the designer This time LaPointe translated her rich vision by juxtaposing lightweight textures that could still be layered in balmy weather I was really inspired by the idea of introverts and extroverts she said backstage I dont think you can pin anyone down and define them Everyone is kind of both so I wanted to present something with a lot of contrasts A glossy pony robe coat was spliced with pleated (and surprisingly pliable) vinyl and a chunky sleeveless sweater was thrown over a swishy sequin skirt It would make a chic party lookyou could even wear flats  LaPointe acknowledged that this was a new direction for the brand But her customers many of whom shop at Bergdorf Goodman her biggest retailer come back to her because they want luxurious wearable pieces that feel a bit unexpectedand that's just what they'll find here$$Saloni Lodha launched her brand on the strength of its signature printed dresses That focus has always served her well but this time around the designer finally feels shes in a place to branch out This is the biggest collection weve ever done said Lodha who added denim leather and T-shirt categories to her lineup this season I didnt want to expand too soon Now we are at a stage with our retailers where they really can see us as a full brand Brand extensions can go either way of course But here the new categories were a major boon Lodha successfully translated the lines signature playful femininity into those aforementioned leather and denim jackets jeans and T-shirts by way of clever embellishments A favorite included a 70s-inspired cropped denim jacket with a random spattering of grommets in primary colors that is sure to be street style photography bait next season while a leather jacket embroidered with flowers was an unexpected alternative for evening Often the new categories furthered themes that have been central to Lodhas aesthetic from the beginning A pair of organic natural-dye jeans in which you can see stripes of variation in the springy pink hue were made in Pondicherry India the same area that Lodha named her LLC for when she first launched her business But the core of the brand will always be printed dresses theyre a buyers no-brainer and a consistent best-seller For Spring the designer tweaked some of the offerings to go even more romantic with skin-baring cutouts and prints painted on lace All in all this collection was a strong step forward for Saloni$$Flavia Pennetta the Italian winner of this years US Open received a round of applause from the audience as the lights went down at Salvatore Ferragamo Her surprise victory didnt impact creative director Massimiliano Giornettis latest offering which was underway months ago nonetheless there was a certain synergy in the matchup Giornettis latest collection had a buoyant grace Though it's not activewear by any stretch of the imagination a woman could be active in these dresses and look great  Leather is almost obligatory chez Ferragamo even for Spring Giornetti did a fine job of making it suitable for warm weather cutting it in generous proportions and using bar-tacked seams that quite literally let a paperbag-waist skirt and loose-fitting culottes breathe But despite the houses shoemaking legacy the best pieces here werent skins Rather they were the midi-length sundresses in lofty cotton one in black with bows on the shoulder straps a strapless style with a wrapped waist in sky blue and another strapless frock that combined tiers or black dusty pink and coral Knit dresses had a springy bounce too By comparison chiffon numbers with feather embellishments looked fussy and there were a few too many extraneous bows on other pieces Still all in all this was a good-looking outing for Giornetti$$On a recent phone call Samu-Jussi Koski reported that the consensus from friends and family was that his clothes had done some growing up since last spring Its an unexpected comment perhaps given the certain ageless appeal that has always characterized the Samuji brand But there was a new serenity to this seasons looks owing in part to the scaled-back quirk factor Gone were the high-shine silver metallics the crafty mermaid print and the kicky colors In their place the designer delivered a concise lineup of spare tranquil pieces inspired by the glamour of mid-century film stars holidaying in the south of Italy the results were far from retro A palette that took its cues from the delicate shades of gelatopistachio melon peachlent a subtle sweetness tempered by modern-feeling shapes (terrific cropped flares) and fabrications (a glossy leather-like black resin-coated cupro) Knits remain a strong category for the label like a sheer sea-foam-color mock neck ideal for layering or svelte ribbed styles to team with an A-line mini Another strong suit of Koskis Outerwear especially two styles in washi paper a fabrication thats far more environmentally friendly than say viscose thats a choice that is both grown-up and great-looking$$Sea designers Sean Monahan and Monica Paolini have long been associated with a breezy hippieish spirit but theyve started to sense that others are encroaching on their territory Were trying to move away from boho a bit Monahan said surrounded by at least seven racks in the duos airy Canal Street loft (a fifth-floor escape amid the chaos of New York Fashion Week) Seas signatureslace eyelet embroidery and looser silhouettescertainly fit the boho stereotype and they also happen to be trending heavily elsewhere And while Sea consistently feels easy and effortless some other designers iterations of the boho trend seem overwrought So for Spring Monahan and Paolini opted for sleeker shapes such as culottes quilted jackets and boxy blouses and nixed their usual hand-distressing It added up to clothes that were as arty and youthful as ever but just a touch more refined which will only help them at their biggest stockist Barneys New York For example instead of holey jeans they washed their ice-blue denim over and over so it emerged as soft as cashmere It was particularly covetable on a slit-front midi skirt with a braided belt The designers also played with heavier more geometric lace patterns which felt refreshingly non-flimsy and in lieu of complicated embroideries they employed the beauty of natural textures like rumpled linen and crisp cotton  Without question daywear is Seas specialty but there were some surprisingly chic day-to-night propositions too like a deep-V indigo jumpsuit and an apron-front gingham dress Both would look equally lovely with white sneakers or glittery stilettos but it would be interesting to see what Monahan and Paolini might do with a tux or silk party dress$$Where does the See By Chlo girl go when the winds of travel blow her stateside Cali of course This season Clare Waight Keller imagined her muse roadtripping from San Francisco to Big Sur bringing with her clothes that reflected the houses Anglo-Franco vibe and all but guaranteed a good time Here were breezy pieces in a sunbleached palette that spoke to days spent driving around with the top down cream soft peach washed-out blues Denim came in two distinct formscrisp indigo and a supple lighter shade that felt akin to something you had worn and loved for years That was just one of many parallels with the looks that went down the main line runway last Spring frothy broderie anglaise here trimming blouses dreamy bohemian gowns head-to-toe total look dressing SBC even debuted another take on Waight Kellers jean maxi skirt this one slung low on the hips and with a frayed hem Elsewhere a geometric archival Chlo print from the seventies found new life in a knit dress and sweater There was plenty of lovely youthful sprezzatura to be had here and even if Chlos more senior customer might take a pass on the graphic sweatshirts you got the sense that she wouldn't hesitate to snap up other styles for some adventuring of her own$$When Sharon Wauchob said Sometimes you dont want to change anything and then there are times when youre hungry for something new she made a key admission of a feeling likely shared by other designers For this collection Wauchob was operating in the latter headspace without betraying the former One wouldnt normally associate her restrained and refined approach with the word unhinged yet thats how she framed this go-round pointing out how as a woman designer the end goal isnt necessarily shock value so much as defying expectations Wauchob did that by using techniques that imbued her clothes with a spectrum of strong personalities Whereas the crushed pleated silk jumpsuit registered as romantically restless bouncing with each stride a lace slip dress festooned with tufts of cardinal red silk fringe signaled something wilder The collection tempted from all directions in no case more than a skirt fronted with leather and backed with lace Even the unlined suede coats encircled with low-slung belts featuring an irregular brass medallion hinted at that same alluring ease If all that matters to a potential client is the degree of sheerness then that person is missing the point (or should stick to the ingenious cross-body bag dangling from a single eyelet) Suffice it to say the level of savoir faire surpassed layman explanations and with so many permutations of such provocative workmanship the fabrication details barely mattered With Wauchob its easy to default to calling her collections delicate but consider the slouched trousers sneakers and new sculptural jewelry by Chris Boland and the descriptor becomes imprecise at best Despite all the vintage and vaguely Asian influences this lineup captured Wauchobs desire to bridge past and future The desire has probably always been there its just taken her until now to let go of being understated$$Its really remarkable that Siblings Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery managed not only to put on a show this afternoon so soon after the death of their partner in style Joe Bates but to stage one filled with such joie de vivre The collection was dedicated to Bates whose presence was much felt by his absence but it was also a tribute to 60s starlets such as Monica Vitti and Brigitte Bardot and imagined them bumming around the Riviera in various iterations of leopard print The 60s reference wasnt particularly literal Bryan and McCreery gave it a strong disco gloss with lots of sparkling knits and their way of riffing on the eras fascination with man-made fabrications was to create skirts dresses and coats in whipstitched sculpted plastic Those items were highly editorial as were the cape and gown in a ball-bedecked crochet Other looks were more street-ready The glittery knit slip dresses and cardigans were accessible and appealing while items in leopard-print denim could happily find a home in many a sassy girls wardrobe A short-sleeved swing coat in the denim seemed well suited to a contemporary would-be Bardot The highlights of the show however were two other similarly shaped pieces of outerwear The frilled plastic and gold-tipped knit coats had the madcap quality one seeks in a Sibling collection and showcased the labels signature innovative knit work but they came off as viably wearable rather than camp or experimental or absurd No doubt Bates would have been proud$$Jake Sargent and Daniel Corrigans Spring outing for Simon Miller combined their perennial Japanese influences with an American Southwest attitude Here was a collection that was sparse in spirit but had a great richness to it thanks to the fabrications the designers opted for Their biggest aesthetic splurges came where color was concerned Pops of burnt red and chartreuse felt right in step with more sun-bleached neutrals and tawny nubuck Also new this season A strong move into bags at opposite ends of the size spectrum from the itty-bitty Bonsai with ring handleswhich was right in step with street styles current yen for tiny shapesto a big bucket bag to carry all your worldly possessions and sling over your shoulder Knitwear was especially appealing Chalk that up to the Japanese silk tops and skirts which projected a kind of cool mid-century austerity As far as denim was concerned the duo made a bet on their great wide leg as a hero silhouette offering it in a buttery suede that will be tough to beat in terms of simple laid-back luxury for spring In addition to the bags the pair is finding other ways of emphasizing Simon Miller as a lifestyle brand They have launched an eyewear collaboration with New York optical legend Sol Moscot and teamed up for an offbeat sandal capsule collection with the cultlike Japanese footwear label Jojo Simon Miller may not be a new kid on the block but in Sargent and Corrigans expert hands it continues its confident march toward becoming a household name$$Its a wonderful thing when a young designer truly comes into her own at a point when expectations and respect have already been running high but then she simply exceeds all that Simone Rocha sent that feeling through her audience today withwhen it comes down to itthe amazing things she did with pink dresses That sounds narrow if not sugary but from the two semitransparent opening looks she showedpuff-sleeved full-skirted and boldly bisected with black macram strapsshed already riveted the attention of everyone who had come to see her show in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London It takes some daring for a young designer to hire a former royal palace heaving with gilding and British establishment history but there she was amongst the grandeur it all showing an entrancing collection which succeeded in elevating her talent for prettiness sexuality tenderness and quirky techniques to a new level Where did that come from I found out I was pregnant while I was in Japan working on a project with Dover Street Market Ginza and then went on to Kyoto for a few days said Rocha I was suddenly seeing everything so intensely it felt trippy It wasnt a collection which overtly stated Japanese influenceswhich of course can be hackneyedso much as it insinuated and abstracted them Part of it was down to Rochas adulation of the photographer Nobuyoshi Araki to whose bar she made a pilgrimage in Tokyo Arakis body of work involves specialist bondage practices peculiar to Japan Thats what triggered Rocha to start thinking about knots and braids and begin developing cross-body straps whole bodices in clear plastic and finishing dresses with silken strands running across bare backs  Rarely have the notions of prettiness and perversity from a young womans point of view come together so potently This was also a collection which absolved Rocha of any former accusations of heaviness and repetition Her airy bouncy organza skirts put paid homage to that just as the new chic bubble-sleeved narrow dresses the series of spongy tailoring decorated with kimono-cum-couture bows and the green bamboo-forest prints proved something else Rocha has range It was a personal breakthrough$$The girl who wears Sonia by Sonia Rykiel may be updating her wardrobe every seasona coat with trompe l'oeil detailing here a leather striped miniskirt therebut shes consistently the same playful gal at heart For Spring there happened to be a lot of hearts embroidered together as broderie anglaise swirled into a bandana paisley frilled and tacked onto the shoulders of a tee studded to the back of a heel (the liveliest of all appeared mid-wink as if making eye contact with its Comme des Garons pals) There were other motifs too including warmly hued rainbows simplified flowers and a particularly sassy pair of lips that could be zipped open and shut from the chest of a sweater  If the collection sounds like it put too much emphasis on throwback prints the overall effect didnt exhaust the eyes This was largely owing to additional themes that expanded upon reliable Rykiel signatures A denim story for instance did not always consist of jeans indigo tweed cleverly conveyed as much versatility while dark blue satin dressed down a sequined shift For all the integrated embellishments accessories factored stronglyand surrealisticallyin giving the looks an updated twist See also the sparkly socks paired with high-heeled sandals And when a Lurex dress specially knit to appear striped was referred to as ideal date-night attire the sweet side of Sonia by Sonia suddenly turned coquettish Except that this Rive Gauche girl of the street (the photos taken once again by Sonia Sieff show Langley Fox posing in the middle of the road) is far more likely to wear her heart on her sleeve than make an outright shameless gesture$$We were back at Sonia Rykiels famous Left Bank shop for Julie de Librans Spring show today The recently installed bookshelves were covered with black velvet curtains and the runway glittered like wet pavement Waiters passed around electric blue cocktails and Londons CAR provided the soundtrack setting the stage for a collection pitched mostly toward evening Saint-Germain-des-Prs in addition to its famous brasseries and cafs also has a thriving club culture according to the program notes In De Librans first two runway shows for the French brand the offerings were broader but this one began and ended with sequins  In between the designer touched on the famous Rykiel sweaters turning out baseball-style tees in a thick crochet that looked handmade and slinky pliss knit dressesbut sadly there were no stripes the house signature Note to designers at heritage brands Dont ignore the heritage The shows loose theme was les oiseaux de nuitnight owlso there were bird motifs on everything from a poplin camp shirt to silk pajama sets and more than a few marabou feather stoles Cotton dresses in a swallow print that looked a lot like camo were the shows best pieces danceable yet also easy to wear during the day We wouldnt have minded seeing more of that kind of thing But before or after dark easy-to-wear was an imperative for De Libran The holographic sequin dresses that closed the show were knitted not embroidered and the back sides were fine-gauge sweaters meaning they were as light as can be and as comfortable as a T-shirt but glam nonetheless$$The Sophie Theallet show this evening kicked off with a bang A literal one Audience members snapped to attention as a drummer pounded out a loud beat from the far reaches of Theallets outdoor show space The attention was called for as this latest collection from the designer was one for which you wanted to be wide awake This was a joyful fashion show The music supplied by a troupe of Senegalese drummers was thoroughly happy-making and so were the clothes the best that Theallet has ever produced Africa was the key reference here unabashedly so It was a dream of Africa as Theallet put it that she extrapolated via textures of raffia and burlap cape silhouettes and extraordinary couture-quality lace that read a bit like snakeskin There were also beautiful smudged black-and-white prints that riffed on tribal body paint and halter necklines redolent of traditional African chokers Theallet was appropriating but with such a fluency and generosity of spirit and with such good instincts about how to integrate her African inspiration into prototypically Western silhouettes that the appropriation felt earned The Theallet womanand she was a woman not a girlhadnt just gone to Africa and returned with some fresh ideas about aesthetics Shed come back with a whole new point of view There were too many standout looks here to list them all Theallet made magic with her lace using it with subtlety as a cobwebby layer of black on top of a caramel-colored cape and to much more graphic effect in gridded dresses and skirts She also wowed the crowd with two sexy striped lace jumpsuits that were shown on genuinely full-figured girls (This Theallet show was a model for diverse casting in general by the way) Theallet updated her signature hourglass silhouette with panache using broad raffia belts to set off her full shorts and mid-calf skirts The halter-neck dresses and gowns featuring tiers of feathers and raffia strips belong on a red carpet posthaste And the daywear spanned from breezily feminine with ruffled silk dresses in a small smudged dot print to burlap linen tailoring that was almost utilitarian it was so matter-of-fact Theallet finally found her niche as a tailor with this collectionthese looks were nearly as confident as the diaphanous sheer numbers that found her revisiting the brand vocabulary thats been native to her from the start It was fitting that this show concluded with a burst of drumming and dancing Theallet was due a celebration$$Clinically minimal with a twist of 60s redux (deluxe) this maritime-seasoned Sportmax collection should cruise serenely from runway to store rack to wardrobe A toughened-up pinafore shirthemmed dress in heavy white cotton featured the round black pockets that were the ongoing contradiction to pure restraint here They also came on wide sailor pants a lightweight parka and a high-waisted jacket used as a topsail over a white silk blouse There was so much finely draped fabric a-swoosh at the base of another pinafore that sailed forth full-length and zingily orange that it was hard to make out if it qualified strictly as a dress (possible) or jumpsuit (probably) Assuredly the latter was a deep-V-neck kicky-legged muster of irregular monochrome stripes against navy and more orange A pair of tangerine-size eyelets just above the navel on a white shirtdress and a blue front-zip culottes-suit allowed for some hearty here-to-there belt knotting The chain print that clanked to the foreground neatly mirrored the chrome buckles on collars and accompanying bucket bags Cast next was a net print on silk jumpsuits sweaters and skirts before the introduction of grids of round lace as a curtain-closing motif The lack of a Breton stripe showed admirable restraint in what was a Cardin-tinged assembly of sea-flecked 21st-century staples placid and pleasing$$As in seasons past Stella Jeans show was a vibrant cultural nook Despite its bold colors and zingy patterns this was no straightforward travel story Migration was the topic the Italo-Haitian designer highlighted Wednesday through her Spring offering which she showcased refreshingly on a multi-racial model cast In the face of the largest movement of refugees on the Continent since World War II and with Italy becoming one of the main landing points it was a bold move to launch a windblown Milan Fashion Week with a statement and in a new and apt venuethe citys recently opened cultural center Museo delle Culture (Museum of Cultures) or Mudec Departure was the starting point and the designers printed T-shirts emblazoned with imagery from Once Upon a Time in Americathe Sergio Leone filmwas a pithy reference to Italys historical flux From there sweeping in scope the saturated colors rich textures and intricate detailing of the opening looks drew references from South American climes Voluminous printed flounced and maxi skirts recalled traditional Salvadoran dressSalvador is commonly called Bahiaand the spot where immigrants historically entered Brazil Pom-poms tassels and beads embellished many of Jeans playful accessories like great raffia bejeweled slides and handbags Roomy Andean-striped coats and jackets as well as cactus and parrot prints were a contemporary take on the regions ornate style Overlapping continents Jeans signature Wax & Stripes designsmade of vibrant patterns worn across West Africaappeared as ruffle-sleeved tunics and skirts and prim appropriations of silk pussy-bow blouses From there the collection shifted to England Highlighting the current exponential growth of Italian immigration to the UK Savile Row tailoring was the designers inspiration and trenchcoats and natty shirting the material result Embracing what her label is known forusing African prints on European formsJeans barefooted finale consisted of very commercial beachwear with a retro 50s aira breezy way to end her powerful far-flung adventure$$The key to summertime dressing is effortlessness Its a principle that Stella McCartney applies to all of her collections and it was in full effect at her upbeat show this morning where she put a major emphasis on knits Knitwear has become more visible on Spring runways over the last couple of fashion cycles as innovative computer-enabled techniques have allowed designers to do things not possible before Theres another reason sweater dressing is on the rise and it comes down to the comfort factor McCartneys layered tanks polo shirts and tube skirts looked stretchy as activewear sporty and poised for action on the athletic sandals they paraded out on but elevated in bright stripes checks and transparencies She also played with vibrant pleated knits in loose trapeze-like shapes with sexy cutaways Its been a great week for color in Paris but McCartneys as bold as anybody combining vivid orange and blue or chili red with pink on those knit separates Swirls of ribbon embroidery made a similarly strong impact on tracksuits and dresses Her other project here was rethinking the suit which has been an icon of the brand from the beginning She did that via deconstruction a double-breasted black jacket was transformed into a strapless form-fitting tunic worn over a multi-slit skirt And she did it by using unexpected materials as was the case with an off-the-shoulder jacket and slouchy pants cut from raw indigo denim with high-contrast white stitching More conventional pieces like vests and trousers had an appealing fluidity and elongated proportions  Slip dresses were another key component of her first collection postSaint Martins nigh on 20 years ago Theres never been a bigger moment for boudoir dressing than Spring 2016 but McCartney more or less avoided the subject A missed opportunity Not really In acid hues her swirling eyelet dresses will stand out at stores next spring$$The first thing Max Osterweis and Erin Beatty wanted to talk about backstage at this mornings Suno show was the shoes After umpteen seasons collaborating with Nicholas Kirkwood Suno has launched its own line of Italian-made footwear Beatty said the goal was to create shoes that looked distinctive but that were easy to wear Not too precious she explained but also not you know too fierce Not too precious/not too fierce also served as a good summation of the clothes on Sunos runway Inspired by a visit to the recent exhibition When the Curtain Never Comes Down at the American Folk Art Museum the designers riffed on the practice of outsider artists who channeled compulsive mental states into their work Their focus was on the ways that these artists would use geometry to create a sense of orderhence the collections repeating square patterns and numerous looks belted (Beatty used the apt word restricted) at the waist One of the nice ways that Beatty and Osterweis got at their theme was by introducing little grace notes of off-ness such as the seemingly random placement of gathers on items like the opening dress in gingham They also made reference to the origin of their inspiration by using folksy techniques and fabricsthat gingham for instance but also eyelet peasant blousestyle ruching and denim A calf-length denim skirt shown with a matching belted minidress was the best look in the show$$Im not your seductress That was designer Suzanne Raes mantra for Spring a manifesto for women who dress for themselves not the gaze of others in short her customers Rae makes quietly arty staples that place an emphasis on construction and fit Here she struck a balance between concealing and revealing boxy unisex shapes like kimonos in Japanese denim and clingier bias-cut dresses Trousers and tops in a sheeny cotton nylon were standouts and gave way to other novel fabrications like a white Italian jacquard splashed all over with burnout blooms That print felt like a rarebut welcomeextravagance among so many garments that receded down to their clear buttons One development for Rae that was anything but retiring A group of two-tone ribbed knits in juicy jolie-laide color combos there was a certain seductiveness to themthe kind that will pit cool girls against their wallets$$When asked backstage about the through line for his Spring 2016 collection Tadashi Shoji summed it up in one word Japan The designer has been feeling nostalgic of late Maybe he suggested because Im old For Resort he mined his childhood spent in Japan and this season he continued the theme with an homage to his native country in the springtime  Shoji drew from the obvious The peonies irises and cherry blossoms that explode all over the country in spring were clearly the inspiration behind a number of looksperhaps too much so A frothy pink cupcake of a gown with fluffy floral appliqus for instance unmistakably recalled the sakura in bloom It was far from groundbreaking to be sure but for Shojis customer thats not necessarily a problem The designer seemed to save up all his daring for a handful of sheer gowns with strategically placed floral embroidery to conceal the good bitsnot unlike the headline-making gown Beyonc wore to the Met Gala this year Everybody is doing sheerRihanna and all those people are doing it and revealing a lot [on the red carpet] said Shoji backstage But I dont like that So I very nicely hid everything and it still looks beautiful Shojis clients will no doubt appreciate the modesty$$By Johnny Talbot and Adrian Runhofs estimation they have done about 800 variations of their ruched stretch dress whose svelte effect has endeared the brand to legions of political wives red carpet regulars and other women with busy social lives back home in Germany and elsewhere Thanks to that little number Talbot Runhof has quietly built a small empire and last spring the house unveiled a new flagship in a Baroque-style manse in Munich  Theres always a lot going on at Talbot Runhof For Spring the story was very much about a palatial lifestyle In the same spirit as last seasons homage to Mona Bismarck a copy of the lavish Marella Agnelli The Last Swan picked up at Rizzoli in New York City became the springboard for exploring what the duo terms sleek maximalism In other words they remained true to their love of intricacy but toned down the volume just a tad sticking to noble fabrics and a neutral palette jazzed up with the occasional splash of blue The result was a succession of loose elongated silhouettes in crisp sun-pleated chiffon satin and crepe sometimes paired with an embroidered shell in layered taffeta trimmed with silk tassels at other times with ecru trousers and always worn with palazzo slippers in candy-color satin  Obviously this woman is not headed to an office anytime soon But if the clothes were intended to feel like a perpetual vacation the collection also nodded to the empire that made the Agnelli lifestyle possible The iconic Fiat factory in Turin Italy for example was the concept behind the modernist Lingotto print that cropped up on a silk top caftan and long cotton skirt Likewise an Art Decoinflected cogs-and-gears print emerged on a chiffon pantsuit and under a veneer of transparent sequins on an evening gown Elsewhere the pair threw it into high gear to express movement in rows of fringe in guipure lace and laser-cut hologram foil on a sleeveless tweed jacket The one-off white parka with tufts of fil coupe was a bit of a wild ride the designers allowed Wisely they stopped there And anyway it was aperitivo time$$Tamara Mellon the cofounder and former CEO of Jimmy Choo is a businesswoman with a flourishing eponymous line and the empire-touting uniform to match It makes sense that she has a knack for translating that knuckle-under look into her collections Her latest was a riff on the I am woman hear me roar soundtrack of the 70s translated into body-skimming frocks long and lean jumpsuits and plenty of look-at-me shine So what does the wardrobe of the fearless woman who has it all include There were Amazonian Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman references a hot pink maxi dress spliced in the midsection with a studded leather eyelet for a sliver of skin and a thick bodice wrapped around the waist of a light dress for a cinched hourglass look There was also a dash of Studio 54 with nods to other retro heroines of the night like a slinky silver Lurex jumpsuit which could have been worn by Bianca Jagger As for Mellons bold signature punch of animal prints there was a bare-shoulder leopard-print frock complete with a thigh-skimming slit Perhaps thinking of the woman on the go Mellon referenced the optic white jumpsuits she designed for the crew of Blade a helicopter service that flies passengers to the Hamptons This time she made them in dark denim complete with a thick collar and a front zippera piece which ought to make the wearer feel like shes in the pilots seat$$Tanya Taylora longtime proponent of color and cheerstood in all white at the end of a rainbow-filled room at the presentation of her Spring 2016 collection The designer had enlisted the Minneapolis street artist Hot Tea (n Eric Rieger) to dangle thousands of pieces of colored yarn from the ceiling of the Swiss Institute in Soho for her show (he is the artist who yarn-bombed the Williamsburg Bridge in 2013 bedecking the pedestrian overpass into a Crayola-hued canopy) It was just the most beautiful thing said Taylor I wanted to bring it here Color ricocheted throughout the gallery spacethough really it would have anyway Taylors designs reveled in hand-painted floral prints checks stripes oversize knits woven through with braided Swarovski beading boldly striped sundresses and subtle safari detailing like that on a plaid seersucker pleated sundress that laced up the bodice A first foray into denim was as light and feminine as the rest of the showing boasting a Swiss dot effect across a military-esque anorak and lace laser-cut edges at the hems of cropped trousers A swingy bell-sleeved frock was garden-party ready with green pleated cuffs and skirt the sort of thing that one pops on and is immediately coaxed to twirl Sure texture was especially important this season for Taylor (who spent part of the summer in Kenya with the Clinton Foundation and came away from her Maasai cultural experience with an increased interest in beading) but the message of the collection was one of pretty above all else And you know what There are far worse things to be for spring$$Telfar ranks among that rarefied group of mens labels on the utilitarian unisex front where the question of gender hangs in the air but doesnt actually come into question In fact said designer Telfar Clemens before the show and without a moments hesitation I kind of started the whole thing Which is to say that particular shade of ambiguity is at this point beside the point Its old hat by now blurred subverted transcended Plus this is the labels 25th season making it more of a seasoned grown-up than a scrappy young thing hell-bent on provocation Born out of a streetwise functionality Telfar aspires to exactly that Subliminal branding the designer asserted nothing frivolous Of course frivolity is in the eye of the beholder and it remains to be seen what the beholder makes of off-the-shoulder tanks dress shirts with missing sides and halter tops whose spaghetti straps stretch over a mans articulated shoulders to a comical cheeky effect That and a pair of white daisy dukes practically shrink-wrapped over bulging thighs were among the only suggestions of old-school drag Shoes straddled the fence between ballet flats and standard-issue Vans-style sneakers As for branding the name Telfar brazenly scrawled down the front of shirts in a lacy mesh and a TC logo stitched into every other piece werent exactly subliminal but droll insider references to logomania never go unappreciated  Clemens also indulged in a fussy obsession with the numbers six and eight wherein detailsparticularly cargo pocketsappeared no fewer than six or eight times on a given sleeve belt loop tag and so on Bizarre to be sure but it added to the collections curious enigmatic allure To say nothing of the backdrop a trippy animation of the designer as avatar mixed with allusions to the sponsor White Castle Product placement was never like this$$According to the Temperley London show notes laid out on attendees seats the theme of Alice Temperleys latest collection was Havana This was one of those occasions where after the final dfil you glanced again at those notes considered what youd just seen on the runway and thought Nah Its not that Temperley didnt reference Havana or her private fantasy of Havana in these clothes its just that the Cuban motifs ran a distant second in importance to the shows real theme which was embroidery The heart of this collection was Temperleys heavily embroidered sundresses and likewise embellished sundress-esque ensembles Backed in crisp white or navy cotton these pieces came in a variety of relaxed silhouettes and played host to a virtual fireworks display of floral and abstract embroidered patterns Theyll be catnip on the sales floorindeed women who dont usually gravitate to Temperley may find themselves tempted by the sundress looks The designer deployed similar styles of embroidery on more formal tulle-backed dresses and separates as well The look of the decorative embroidery was repeated on non-embroidered garments too Notably Temperleys signature intarsia knits echoed the effect as did some of the pieces in printed silk The collection as a whole had a winning sense of easeeven the tailored looks shared in its languorous tropical vacation tone which was amplified by the romance of Temperleys occasional ruffles and flounces The one quibble really was with the full-on evening looks The combination of mirror sequins and tassel embroidery came off a touch de trop Temperley did better with her more casual takes on the category in particular the silk kimono gown in a tropical bird print Here at least the show notes rang true The dress was embroidery-free and the Havana theme came through$$At her presentation this afternoon Tess Giberson admitted that her latest collection was really just an extension of the one shed designed for Resort No complaints thereGibersons Resort collection was a rich yet concise interpretation of her experience visiting Walter Gropius's house in Massachusetts and given that she had more to say about Gropiuss home it was nice to find her revisiting the theme As Giberson put it her focus this time was on moments within the house rather than its overarching aesthetic impact With that in mind she dilated on details such as the lacing on chairs or the fringes of a pillow and expanded them into recurring motifs The fringe came off particularly wellclean and un-hippieishwhile the lacing used widely made for some of the sexiest looks Giberson has ever produced notably the double-slit skirt with a front panel of upholstery-like jacquard Another winning extrapolation from chez Gropius was the deep blue watercolor striped silk taken from a duvet which Giberson made into a fantastic pieced-together slip dress It looked like just the thing to wear on a hot and humid summer daya day you might say a lot like this one Pieces in bone-white mesh were just as suited to swampy weather while micro-pleated trousers detailed with a canny ankle slit or ribbed knit dresses with architectural cabling about the neckline had a more trans-seasonal durability As a whole this collection continued the roll that Giberson has been onif she needs to continue making pilgrimages to the homes of great architects to keep it going so be it$$For his Spring 2016 collection Thakoon Panichgul filled his front row with It-girl artists (Langley Fox Hemingway Phoebe Collings-James) and a smattering of actresses who like to align themselves with a certain artistic sensibility (Bella Heathcote Christina Ricci Jessica Alba) and really who better than the very fetching and creatively inclined to celebrate what the designer called a vision of the New Bohemia  For Thakoon that New Bohemia will be tie-dyed From the bleached lightweight denim to the slim silk slip dresses printed with a grunge grid to the crinkled chiffon evidence of the hippie-favored coloring technique was everywhere on his runway And what the designer proposed do bohemians love more than tie-dye Wearing their pajamas of course Out came all manner of elegant attire for sleep enthusiasts seemingly Julian Schnabelinspired chambray robe coats and scoop-hemmed micro-shorts (longer in the center mimicking the hem of a sleep shirt) in pale shades of robins-egg blue with trim crimson piping or pure white terry cloth all worn with immediately covetable comely flat sandals that were halfway between a huarache and a gladiator As for wearing your pajamas out on the town when youre busy being creative who has time for clothes Well actresses do of course and the most winning takeaways came in the sleekly crisp bicolored broderie anglaise dressesjust the thing for a Cannes photo call (Theres plenty of time to divulge your artistic leanings at the press conference straight after)$$Whats new in Greg Chaits hyper-luxe world of knits Plenty The Elder Statesman has amped up its offerings over the past couple of seasons and for Spring there was a lot to love For one thing Chait worked with middle-weight yarn for the first time turning out strong pieces like a pink cold-shoulder dress and a gauzy milk-white jumper Elsewhere sweatpants and a hoodie (as you might imagine a far decadent cry from the Champion of your adolescence) came printed all over in the softest of gradient rainbows And what kind of comfort-hating monster could argue with propositions like black-and-white striped pull-on cashmere shorts or a pastel hand-tie-dyed polo maxi dress in silk cashmere Most importantly Chaits clothes dont just feel goodthey look good Take a woven Kenyan cotton with an irregular hand in a gorgeous mottled cream color smashing in a pair of button-front trousers or the plushest Italian cashmere as woven on a traditional backstrap loom in Central America The latter came whipped into a dreamy top with softly fraying edges and a crocheted neckline and the effect was as quietly polished as many a piece youd find at the high-end stores where The Elder Statesman is carried And despite a laid-back brand image that polish continues to distinguish the label As Chait himself tells it Theres a free-spiritedness but were not hippies Doubtful Look no further than this seasons hero graphic tee which read simply Hippies are ruining the world$$It may not always look like it from the pictures but the traditional order and format of shows has been thrown up in the air over the past year At the luxury level innumerable houses have decided to break the system and show when where and how they choose in order to reach the women they most want to engage which has sent guests off on many a globe-trotting trip in pursuit of the fashion experience Now The Row has done the same not showing in its hometown New York but shifting to Paris where as Mary-Kate Olsen explained many of our customers are who we want to support As you will see tomorrow we are having a show in a chteau 45 minutes outside Paris Now 45 minutes outside Paris tantalizing as that sounds does not fit the schedules of journalists who are doing the rounds of the shows every hour on the hour So yesterday Mary-Kate and sister Ashley gave them a preview of what a more exclusive crowd will be seeing today Its interesting to speculate how this collection will go down among a mixed European audience In one way The Row comes straight out of the American tradition of simplicity and pure lines which goes back to the minimalism of the 80s and even further to principles of usefulness that have roots in the pioneering spirit Though the Olsens showed a couple of draped chiffon minidresses and a sheer pleated two-piece here their natural design instinct is to stay far away from the body and keep any sense of sexual display under wraps (there was literally a linen blanket coat) and feet grounded in slides In a way they are passive resisters to the idea of trends and fashiontheirs is work that comes under the heading of lifestyle and a luxuriously serene one too Thats the point at which the philosophy is likely to connect most easily with a certain French tradition that also fundamentally rejects nouveau display The Row isnt Herms but maybe the Olsens can persuade their Euro audience that they share the same kind of sensibilities$$Back in the mid-90s when Lisa Kulson was designing the first pairs of Theory pants she mightve rolled her eyes at the high-water trousers that are the look of the moment now We all probably would have But fashion changes and in its latest incarnation Theory is in the business of responding to those shifts I want women to think of us as a lifestyle brand Kulson said under a cloudless sunset on the rooftop of the companys Meatpacking District headquarters Were not the brand that made your first interview suit anymore  There were culottes and slouchy track pants and walking shorts Polka dots and stripes featured in the mix A suede tunic and coat nodded slightly at the 70s And the off-the-shoulder silhouette thats suddenly everywhere turned up on both a top and a belted dress But it was a navy pair of those high-water trousersschoolboy pants is how Kulson described themthat got editors jazzed tonight Throw in the matching navy blazer with brass buttons and the whole suit would cost less than the pants alone at the fancy French house that did them first Smart$$Its hard to know what to say about a collection like the one Thom Browne showed today Not because theres nothing to write aboutindeed theres so so muchbut because Browne telegraphs his messages so overtly theres not much room for interpretation Browne is kind of a control freak as designers go You can see that in the fastidiousness of his collectionstheir silhouettes their fabrications their embellishments their presentation This is not a bad thing But one of the things he wants to control is the meaning of his clothes Which means his collections are about what theyre aboutno less and (heres the rub) no more In lieu of interpretation theres description And as usual Brownes outing today was a feast for the eyes He offered the audience a red herring in the set It seemed thanks to the feet sticking out from under the bare-bones house hed installed at the center of his runway that there was a Wizard of Oz theme afoot You might have validated that guess in the way the collection shifted at one point from all-grayscale looks to ones in color But no The real clues were in the desks inside the house the models sat at after concluding their deliberate dfil and in their little jackets and pleated skirts and in the Japonerie motifs inscribed on those tailored pieces in elaborate and nearly trompe loeil ways Browne was riffing on the aesthetic and the mien of Japanese schoolgirls Cest tout The decoration of Brownes looks was awe-inspiring at the levels of both inventiveness and craft The reiterated jackets and pleated skirts were collaged together or embroidered in ways to evoke Mount Fuji landscapes or patterns of cherry blossom or koi or Edo-style illustrations of geishas Certain looks expanded the canvas of the clothes to include intarsia minks Others like the jaw-dropping ribbon-embroidered pastel sack jacket gave a more abstract watercolor effect The techniques and the silhouettes varied but a sense of uniformity prevaileda sense Browne imparted purposefully of course Theres undoubtedly a pair of trousers languishing in the sales collection associated with the one Browne showed on the catwalk but the story Browne was telling at his show was emphatically one of jackets pleated skirts coordinated long button-downs worn as layering pieces and frequently a coat The individual garments betrayed Brownes idiomatic sense of whimsy and wit but as a whole they towed a party line The only exception was in the finale look a radiantly iridescent confection of floor-length layered pleats This was the schoolmarm and by the time she emerged from backstage Browne had more than made his point Its a credit to his artistry that it was a pleasure to see it underlined$$Thomas Taits show this afternoon was one of those odd outings that dont seem at first to be up to much but then accrue in force as the looks accumulate The impact of Taits latest collection generated from the ways the clothes forced your engagement whether via the play of light on assertive multicolor crystal embellishment or the sound made by the jewelry that dangled off of certain pieces jangling like cat bells The most intriguing of Taits stratagems to command your attention were the porthole-like openings that decorated all manner of his garmentsthey were like little windows for Peeping Toms to peer through and the more Tait reiterated the motif the more you keyed into the collections compelling voyeuristic tone Tait intended that reaction As he explained backstage after the show he wanted these clothes to create a sense of awkward intimacy Job done Others of Taits engaging effects were more subtle He was playing quite a lot with texture here notably in his ribbed knits and his terrific jeans with their patches of super-shiny black patent leather other looks pulled you in with their wabi-sabi appeal like the frayed quilted jacket and coat or a leather A-line skirt made from antique calfskin Tait also used the skin in his strangest look a heavy jumpsuit featuring a monumental pattern and exaggerated perforation down the sides The piece was interesting on its own but something of an outlier in the context of the rest of the show which emphasized rather accessible silhouettes Taits stovepipe skinny knit flares for instance ought to excite widespread demand Ditto his ribbed knits and the cuffed jeans and denim jacket If Taits goal was to create intimacy he nailed it in those most straightforward looks The best way to be intimate with clothes after all is by wearing them$$Celebrating their 10th anniversary as a trio (Gabi Asfour Angela Donhauser and Adi Gil) minus one from an earlier incarnation Threeasfours designers feel as tightly bound as ever finishing each others sentences and moving about in lockstep This year the brand is also celebrating the win of the National Design Award for Fashion Design from Cooper Hewitt a prestigious honor backed by the First Ladyquite a different image from its other first lady Bjrk This is a new dawn for Threeasfour and the designers wanted to demonstrate the newfound serenity purity and wearability noted Gabi with a higher message of unity for Spring Were like the United Nations of fashion and art added Adi Against a large-scale fractal projection by video artist Alex Czetwertynski the opening look set the just-futuristic-enough tone with its spirals of 3-D-printed digital lace and what the designers call topographic sandals A series of finely cut and layered organza and voile pieces followedthe curvilinear no-corners look thats become the label's signatureas well as a foray into mens with lapel-less jackets and coats As always textures were an integral part of the story they ranged from waxed cotton and neoprene to milky latex and clear vinyl Those fractals returned as prints as the palette of crisp white and shiny champagne gave way to deep earthy reds In spite of its seasoned new maturity Threeasfour can still deliver a drop-jaw moment which here came as clusters of mica mineral sheets adorning the front of a dress and in another look chunks of various agate crystals linked together to form a bodice The message was clear Threeasfour is rock solid$$Designers often refer to a new collection as their baby but at her presentation in her Chelsea town house today Tia Cibani had the real thing sleeping upstairs Five days ago Cibani gave birth to a baby boy the second of her two children While the timing wasnt exactly convenient Cibani made the most of it graciously showing guests around her spacious modern home and sneaking upstairs when she could Plus since Cibani was pregnant throughout the design process there was a tidy logic to showing the collectionher other babyso close to giving birth Cibani was inspired by lush and exotic landscapes in Brazil and the dichotomy between the countrys vibrant festive Samba culturewhich inspired the colorful brushstroke printand the serene beauty of Bahia which influenced the monochromatic looks made from lightweight linen blends Cibani had a lot of fun with texture this seasonfor example mixing hand-embroidered tufted fabrics with raw silks and bouclwhich made the head-to-toe black and white looks the strongest A collaboration with Mt Washington Pottery that yielded long ceramic necklaces like mini sculptures emphasized the earthiness of the collection  Exotic locales aside it was Cibanis pregnancy that helped inform the loose silhouettes and practical versatility of each piece Standouts included a jumpsuit that came in black-and-white sueded cupro and had an adjustable wraparound tie and a billowy ecru coat that was finished with white tape Each look was styled with slip-on Birkenstock flats  Its like yoga clothes but elevated said Cibani who not inconsequentially did a lot of prenatal yoga while pregnant Overall the feeling of the collection is more relaxed$$Kind of chilled out Thats how designer Amy Smilovic described her latest outing which was all about easesomething well no doubt be grateful for when the sticky days of summer (or as in todays case early fall) start rolling in again As a rule silhouettes were long and loose and mostly came in silk or cotton Smilovic said she was inspired by recent trips to Miami and Malibu which put her on a restorative kick and got her thinking about individuality I think with the whole normcore thing people fall too much into uniforms she said I know Im craving to mix it up For Smilovic that meant getting out of her comfort zone working with elements that are almost tacky and making them more refined The once-loathed Bermuda short which came in a variety of colors and materials including a surprising iridescent silk taffeta were a mainstay of the collection Color combinations like forest green offset by a muted turquoise or sapphire paired with slate blue were delightfully off-kilter Smilovic is not a sequin person but in the spirit of trying something new she coated dresses skirts tops and shorts in the shiny stufftweaking silhouettes and palette to ensure it stayed on the right side of tacky For instance on a pair of sequin shorts the crotch and hem were dropped and the silhouette kept loose to turn on its ear what you would imagine when you think of a Miami woman in a sequin short  The sequins were employed to surprisingly sophisticated and beautiful effect on an ankle-grazing dress which came in black and pale pink and interspersed strips of the sparkly material with sheer fabric in the same hue But the dress that every fashion girl will want to wear come spring was the slinky slip dress in nude or oxblood updated with a round neckline and thick straps Smilovic often styles her own shows but this season she worked with Vanessa Traina Snow and the stylists knack for minimalism can be seen in these unadorned slip dresses which were worn without jewelry Expect to see those and the billowy off-the-shoulder tops on the street next season$$As seems to be de rigueur at the moment (see Raf Simons) Belgian designer Tim Coppens delved into the mist of his own adolescent psyche for Spring Quite logically the womens collectionshown in an empty storefront where the lookbook was being shot around the corner from his Soho studiois practically a mirror image of his menswear After all mens was his first calling for which he won a CFDA Fashion Award last year establishing the upstart among New York's fashion firmament For 30-something Belgians plunging into 90s-era adolescence necessarily means a revisit of clubland Indeed Coppens said he went to raves every weekend for five years He translated that time definitely not wasted into melting mushroom prints on bowling-league jackets and sweatshirts an amoeba print taken from his teenage notebook and a fantastic Prince of Wales blue seersucker evocative of ballpoint doodles Bomberssome cropped others keeping their original mens proportionswere another highlight they came baggy yet richly detailed with pockets padding and raw edges Thick-rib tanks and Japanese denim skirts in darker shades lent another dose of not-too-retro appeal Despite the rave-girl roots traces of grown-up tailoring ran throughout in silky evening jackets and a floor-length diaphanous black tunic Meanwhile the sponsors of that CFDA Fashion Award Swarovski have clearly taken a shine to Coppens supplying him with loads of beadspearly ones not flashy rhinestones in keeping with his minimalist tendencies$$First and foremost Timo Weilands clothes are meant to be wearable Add flattering and comfortable to the list too Weiland and his codesigners Donna Kang and Alan Eckstein are very much a part of the New York fashion scene but they arent about to endorse completely sheer dresses or high-concept frippery That doesnt mean the clothes are boring though it seems the goal of every contemporary label is to master easy to-wear pieces that still feel special Over the past few seasons the three have gotten closer to that target by sharpening their focus and embracing a new richer vision For their Spring collection they were inspired by the sweet heady feeling of a new relationship Its when you want to feel really pretty but also comfortable Kang explained For example their flowing skirts and dresses had to pass the cross-legged test so you wouldnt think twice about sprawling out on the grass with your special someone Little cutouts and bow-tie details also managed to be feminine but not cloying the same was true of the ballet pink navy white and olive color palette Elsewhere the trio relied on soft textures to inject a sense of romance see the cable-knit sweater paired with a fraying tweed skirt or a crisp strapless poplin tunic layered over silk pants Either of those looks would make an ideal starting point for girls hoping to embrace the seasons breezier less structured sensibilities without going too far outside their comfort zone$$For her Spring 2016 collection Alessandra Facchinetti decided to start a band And not just any band but the Traveling Wilburys of comely young creative talents Fifteen strong personalities who dont follow the rules because they make their own which is why they have such a following said the show notes and among them were Langley Fox Chelsea Tyler Quentin Jones and Elizabeth Jagger some of whom walked in the show some of whom sat front row (All however were present in portrait form via a series of Sonia Sieffshot images which proudly hung in the entryway) Beyond the rules cried the show notes and to that end the proceedings began with a rockabilly strain cropped trousers with paper-bag waists under Cry-Baby quiffs and paper-thin T-shirts that slipped off the shoulder or leather jackets personalized with guitar-themed patchwork Collared shirts had leather detailing and long silk dresses were printed with vinyl records or were not actually silk at all rather delicately perforated pale shades of leather The accessories had attitude too the sinuous wave bag (in an array of sizes with the guitar straps slung over the shoulder or carried in hand) the iconic Gommino loafer here boasting celestial silver adornments safety pins or bedazzled accents A soft sneaker came on occasion fastened with saddlery detail while a standout striped flat in an extended slipper style will prove just the thing for a spot of Im with the band cool when sported with jeans come spring Bag closures and a glossy perfect loafer sported a subtle graphic new logoa pair of gilded Ts with overlapping stems all pure form and linewhich when considering a motif to demonstrate where the house has been and where its going hit just the right note$$A clay-hued backdrop replete with a trio of eerily lit trees set the naturalistic tone at Togas London Fashion Week runway debut Under the banner of Petals Minerals Squiggles designer Yasuko Furuta explored her complex woman with varying degrees of success In line with the chaotic weather patterns of her adopted city of London (and back home in Tokyo) Furuta showed the kind of trans-seasonal daywear that is trending right now Okay so the heavy mesh white coat appliqud with a cascading nude ruffle wouldnt provide much cover in a downpour but it was so pretty Furuta has lost none of her inventive eye for detailing bronze panels of fish-scale sequins and calcified fabrics had a distinct mossy look But occasionally things veered towards the chaoticwith one too many layers or colors on some of the pleated skirts that have become her signature Still there was much to lust after An opulent take on suiting was sublimely inventivewith riding check heavy satin and tailored skirt-fronted tops with a ruffle-edgeworn over tapered trousers These flourishes were Furutas subtle allusion to her theme their shapes borrowed from the blue and yellow blooms in the on-set trees The flowery feel was echoed in the bags toomost memorably on a drawstring mesh number with a petal-shaped red lacquered top A bag for all seasons then made with that complex woman in mind$$Tomas Maier spends part of the year in Miamiits where he opened his first store back in 2004 He knows sunglasses and it shows in the new line of shades hes launching for Spring 2016 Stripped of excesses and more classic than trendy the metal frame and acetate styles are a good metaphor for his brand which stands for elegance and simplicity and prices that dont make your eyes roll back into your head Theres enough of that elsewhere no His aviators and navigators are thin their lenses flush with the frame and very lightweight they look more expensive than their under-$300 tag Maier knows his way around a sundress too Hes got a trio of them in washed linen for Spring their bright pink and red hues slightly faded in parts like souvenirs from a summer holiday Another dress in cotton with a zigzagging tie-dye motif is sure to have you dreaming about your next warm-weather getaway As much as he likes palm trees (theyre printed on a denim dress and flocked in velvet on the hem of a wrap skirt) and the chill laid-back vibes they connote its not all about the seaside at TM Theres a softly tailored suit in poppy red silk this season and knit cardigans in shrunken proportions that city dwellers will snap up And heres something youll be seeing a lot of on the streets next spring the oversize slightly Yves Saint Laurentin-the-seventies proportions of Maiers peasant blouses tucked into full wrap skirts$$Ramon Martin and Ryan Lobo have had some pretty impressive women pinned to Tomes mood board in seasons past including Louise Bourgeois Sylvia Plath and Dorothy Parker to name a few For Spring though their muse the pioneering Australian visual artist Fiona Hall fell a lot closer to home Ryan and I discovered her before we knew each other when we were both in high school said Martin who like his design partner grew up Down Under We saw her latest project at the Venice Biennale recently and immersed ourselves in her work all over again That powerful energy was reflected in the shows casting today The lineup featured unexpected faces such as veteran 90s models Claudia Mason and Esther de Jong More familiar themes came through in the clothes themselves Menswear stripes deconstructed trenchcoats and shirting are fast becoming Tome signatures With Halls thought-provoking sardine can art as a starting point the palette was somewhat subdued for a Spring collection Painterly flourishes did appear in the form of a palm frond print on a lightweight coat with billowing sleeves a leitmotif that was created by an artist friend in the labels Chelsea studio There was an artisanal touch to the fish scale lace panels of one blush pink jacket too and a white lace evening dress came peppered with crystals Overall the voluminous silhouette recalled the exuberance of a particular set of late-70s muses and you could imagine Marie Helvin Jerry Hall or Pat Cleveland swirling on the dance floor of famed Parisian nightclub Le Sept in any of the ruffled peasant skirts and halter tops even if the more layered paper-bag belted looks would be tricky for mere mortals to pull off Still many of the piecesthose charming asymmetrical ruffled blouses in particularwill hold their own in a modern working wardrobe come the spring$$Palm trees sun-soaked beaches rum punch    island life presents what is arguably the most alluring of chill situations Tommy Hilfiger who has been a regular visitor to the isle of Mustique for the past 30 years would know And today he took the fashion world on a mini tropical escape with his Spring 2016 show where the runway was a boardwalk circumscribing a lagoon complete with its own beach-bar shack  Of course its impossible to envision the Caribbean without thinking of its biggest cultural icon Bob Marley Beyond his musical legacy his influence on fashion continues to reverberate If the number of times his face has been printed on a T-shirt were counted in music sale units his image would have gone platinum a thousand times over  There were no Bob shirts on the runway today Instead all the coolest things in his wardrobe were taken apart and redone in a youthful playful way knitted bucket hats in sunny colors mesh vests done as floor-length cover-ups and his signature soccer tracksuit rendered in burgundy suede and finished with crochet insets And speaking of crochet the boho textile was all over the collection including the neckline of patchwork and billowing chiffon dresses The crochet bathing suit that linchpin of a 70s bohemian wardrobe was re-created in several ways too and it was refreshing to see Gigi Hadid a model whose gorgeous womanly body recalls the first wave of free-spirited travelers that came to Jamaica in the late 60s striding down the runway in a string bikini Reason enough to want to run off to a tropical island or at least dress the part until you can$$The front row at Topshop Unique never fails to attract a gaggle of spirited British It girls and today was no different with the likes of Alexa Chung Suki Waterhouse and Poppy Delevingne all in attendance And although the show notes described the muse of the season in vague terms as a beautiful British rebel who is first past the post at any social engagement collectively the pretty young things in the audience embodied that spirit in spades The collection started off with looks that borrowed from the classics of an English gents wardrobeperhaps because certain high-profile tomboys do abide by the motto Theres nothing sexier than a woman in a mans clothing Its why cricket vests were peppered with holes that alluded to the skin cinched with skinny patent leather belts and then layered over jumbo polka-dot skirts or ankle-nipping cigarette pants The oversize pin-striped blazer a city boy favorite was redone as a minidress and worn with huge mismatched earrings while traditional white button-down shirts were toughened up with leather The most convincing pieces in the collection had a gentler sway about them though one that spoke to the soft feminine mood thats in the air overall this season The array of chiffon dressesone of which was covered in a charming strawberry patternhad an innocent garden-party feeling that was anything but fusty With printed lingerie to match the motif of each diaphanous frock the look presented a fresh answer to the naked dress conundrum namely What on earth do you wear underneath it For party girls who just want to have fun what solution could be more appealing than that$$For her Spring 2016 show Tory Burch picked the bright and airy promenade of the David H Koch Theater at Lincoln Center as the location citing beauty found in unexpected places    enhanced through time and nature as her inspiration Her point was underlined by the large oxidized bronze structure that loomed at the rear of the runway Yes Burch seemed to say even in the era of the new and now some things really do get better with age (Even fashion)  And to that end out came some need-it-now spins on the trends of this summer and next Blocky striped knit tops worn with a wide-leg high-waisted trouser embroidered with a design that lay somewhere between an Aztec and a botanical diagram brightly accented narrow guipure lace separates in periwinkle and saffron fringed-tweed wrap skirts tassel-hemmed linen trapeze tops and embroidered folk blouses of Mexican and Romanian origin rendered in pale blue striped cotton shirting All were done in the most utterly Tory way which is to say both pretty and entirely prep-friendly without any of the resulting bloodlessness They were primed for sultry season promenades from Amagansett to the Amalfi Coast paired with pumps and pearls or whatever next must-have sneaker the future has in store (And for the latter remember here comes Tory Sport) The closing section of caftans and skirts in gray perforated leather and iridescent fil coupe organza didnt seem to follow the same trackits hard to imagine them fitting in at East Coast havens like the Siasconset Casino or Maidstone Club But the mod-inspired narrow tunics sported over flowing trousers and shorts (the version in khaki linen burlap edged in crystal embroidery provoking a mild sense of euphoria among showgoers planning future summer party outfits) would be equally successful on a woman of 16 or 60falling fully on the right side of history$$Tracy Reese has been associated with bright retro-tinged floral prints nipped-waist skirts and sparkle for nearly 20 years Shes the kind of designer who wears a tea-length taffeta dress with platform sandals and vintage earrings on a Tuesday afternoon For Spring her clothes were as glam and girly as ever but there was a new deconstructed ease I always love shape but I wanted to find a way to do that without so much structure Reese explained backstage One way she added dimension without hard lines was with layered textures rough-cut swaths of lace over a shimmering slip paper-thin PVC thrown over a brocade shift a nubby linen trench dotted with crystals Shine was a big message this season and the light-catching dance floorready pieces were easily the most exciting Even a boxy sequin T-shirt had more attitude than the boldest most eye-popping print It felt effortless like you could throw it on and get to the party within five minutes flat Prints are Reeses signature but it would be refreshing to see her explore texture and that undone quality a bit further its more in line with what girls want to wear too$$Its a good moment for Pookie Burch and Louisa Burchs Trademark With Alessandro Micheles Gucci the current benchmark of cool the sisters oddball quirk and slightly retro sensibility should find a whole new audience Until now Trademarks Soho outpost has operated as something of an insiders secret the place editors and stylists go for a pair of high-rise floods or a vintage-look sweater We expect the Spring collection with its crinkle patent jacket and skirt its tomato intarsia crewneck and its slightly daffy see-through trench will lure in fans of fashions new nerd-chic look Those of you whove been watching Trademark since its late-2013 launch however will clock a distinct maturity to this lineup Alongside some of the showier pieces there were trim linen shirts an easy-to-wear poplin dress with a micro-pleated sash and smart trousers with subtle slits above the ankles The Burches did cashmere for the first time this season and their tube-trim oversize V necks have a luxe hand They also gave eveningwear a go a taffeta dress with pliss shoulders and a wrap detail at the waist retained the casual polish of their more familiar daywear Speaking of polished the Trademark logo tape on the inside of shirt cuffs was a delicious little detail as were the mini pom-poms tracing the sleeve seams on a pair of boatneck sweaters$$For Spring 2016 Trina Turk left her beloved native Californiaa place that has consistently provided her with inspirational fodderfor a fresh locale across the pond Ive been to Capri a few times over the years said Turk and we realized wed never done a Mediterranean-inspired collection The season begins on the Cte dAzurSaint-Tropezs iconic striped umbrellas inspired a handful of nautical items while Cannes and Cap Ferrat informed some of the more city-appropriate looksbefore traveling down the coast to Italian vacation destinations like Positano and Capri The influence of those seaside spots was apparent in the vibrant color palette and party frocks and beach cover-upsdone up in packable matte jersey and crochetthat had a little dolce vita to them Pants continue to be big for the brand Lace flares silky culottes and printed wide-leg versions provided ample two-legged alternatives for cocktail hour The kick flare has been a huge hit for the label and for Spring it comes in a crop tooa style that was actually part of some of Turks earlier collections and that shes happy to see circle back But the silhouette the designer is most excited about is a twist on the classic caftan dress roomy and scarf-like but with spaghetti straps With the 20th anniversary of the brand behind her Turk is feeling even more confident in the labels core sensibility This season we thought Lets just be more Trina Turk than ever she said That played out in bold floral patterns that mostly wound up on the right side of sixties and seventies kitsch But despite the retro vibe Turk is definitely a woman of the present One print was sourced from contemporary illustrator Lisa Congdon who Turk foundwhere elseon Instagram$$Gaia Trussardi was already deep into her research for this collection when she caught a National Geographic documentary about Australian writer Robyn Davidson During the late 70s Davidson spent nine months traversing Western Australia accompanied only by four camels and a dog (who didnt make it) her ensuing account of the adventure Tracks was a hitthink Wild without the relationship problems It represented the moods and characteristics of a woman I was thinking about said Trussardi The need for a contact with nature How nature can fill you up The result was a collection intended to appear sandblasted wind-whipped and faded by the sun Long-skirted jackets and pleated full pants in neutral striped herringbone linen were left unfinished and tattered at the edges The ribboned bib on a blue shirt was ruffled as if by force Shirtsmore like caftanswere delivered ankle-length split to the hip and worn as layers under jackets or as a piece of outerwear The beaded prints were created from blown-up images of religious tribal masks and the models all wore Virgin Mary necklaces The palette swerved from neutral to pastel with debatable success these rough-hewn heavy-textured loose pieces rather disagreed with the prissiness of soft pink and apricot Trussardi has complained that when it comes to using leather in her collections she is damned if she does (so obvious) and if she doesnt (why didnt she) Today she went with wrap split skirts and a fine raspberry duster jacket in double-layered suede and yellow jerkin-like calfskin crop tops as well as a long gown with a half-moon panel that was cut too narrow to walk easily in The oversize stitching detail on her penultimate look a black suit was a nod to Trussardis glove-making DNA Overall this collection was neither a triumph nor a catastrophe that blue look was pretty good the tailoring fine (cummerbunds apart) and there was plenty to catch the eye of liberal-leaning acai eaters in search of clothes that signal urbane rusticity and luxurious roughness$$At first glance it was hard to believe Tina Lutzs new collection for TSE was inspired by Rastafarians The label is known for golf courseappropriate twin sets after all But Lutz used to frequent Jamaica with her husband where they hung out in the mountains made friends with locals and bonded over jerk chicken and curried goat Its just so different from anything you know she explained Dont expect the typical red green and yellow color palette though Lutzs mood board was covered in photos from Beth Lessers 2008 book Dancehall The Rise of Jamaican Dancehall Culture which documented Rastafarian style in the early 80s Their look was heavy on crisp whites and pastels but it was really all in the details pointelle stitching skinny stripes and clever seam details took sweaters and polos to a much more eccentric place Lutz merged those retro vibes with TSEs complex knit techniques like a pointelle cashmere sweater printed over the top with a custom digital pattern and shot through with feeder stripes Considering TSE is first and foremost a cashmere brand her challenge was to make those knits superlight so you could actually wear them on the beach She also mixed in billowy voile pants crisp shirting and a standout raffia jacket for good measure The jacket felt intentionally raw and unfinished but the hazy stripes were actually sprayed on with an ink jet It summed up TSEs current vision quite succinctly On one hand the brand is artisanal and low-tech with a rich history but it's also completely up to date with modern technology$$For the first time instead of a runway show Tsumori Chisato opted to stage a presentation The cozier format forced her to self-edit and the final cut totaled roughly half what she normally shows This couldnt have been easy for the persistently playful Japanese designer who dives deep into her themes and doesnt resurface until she has exhausted every visual metaphor The underwater world offers no shortage of source material all conducive to Tsumorphing Highlights included an orange neoprene flipper handbag metallic seaweed floating along an organza blouse a blue tent dress bubbling with broderie anglaise and an airy ivory number covered in delicate frond-like forms (bookmark this one if youre planning an offbeat beach wedding) As usual she represented herself in the collection suited up in scuba gear her alter ego paused at the edge of fraying hot pants and swam around the base of a wavy striped maxi dress The oddest depiction showed her delivering a golden eye to a submerged sleeping giant Indeed soaking up these details would have been difficult on the runway either youd focus on the drawings and unique finishings or try to determine whether the clothes were wearablewhich they were Invariably Chisato sticks to simple dress silhouettes easy outerwear and basic shapes that allow the body to breathe (one exception a Grecian-style gown with an unusual drop-waist drawstring) The models paused long enough for the eye to drift downward discovering pearls trapped in clear platforms like Air Max soles embedded with treasures Chisato made sure to point them out to Kenzo Takada who took in the 28 looks by her side He listened intently the entire time smiling as she spun her stories$$Ulla Johnson is the rare contemporary designer whose clothes tell a vivid story but also resonate with real-life customers Her biggest stockist is Barneys New York but the brand is expanding rapidly into top luxury boutiquesplus its all over Instagram which means new shoppers are discovering it every day That commercial success has made it possible for Johnson to really delve into her aesthetic which she describes as a tapestry of cultures That means theres everything from Peruvian ikat prints to Indian embroidery and touches of Western fringe but its all elevated for city-dwelling women like Johnson herself The designer frequently travels to Peru to develop her luxe knitwear but a recent trip to Japan actually made her see the beauty in being home I really just fell in love with America again she explained Theres a huge Japanese market for vintage Levis and bandanas but Johnson opted for a mix of her own nostalgic references macram and crochet details inspired by Santa Fe a color palette of faded rose taupe and marigold sourced from Richard Diebenkorn paintings icy-blue denim seen on wide-leg jeans and a ruffled dress and a pristine white Victorian lace gown Perhaps the collection hung together so well because the clothes felt genuine and familiarweve all owned a peasant dress or chunky cardigan at some point The idea of revisiting those classic piecesupdated with rich textures and more flattering silhouettesfeels just as fresh as trying whatever the brand-new trend is$$Jun Takahashis Undercover collections usually have a message but you dont have to get his deeper meanings to appreciate what he does After his show at the Cirque dHiver today Takahashi talked about righteous aggression The people need to be strong he said His backstage sentiments jibed with a soundtrack that featured a live version of the Rolling Stoness song for the have-nots Salt of the Earth Takahashi came at his insurrectionary message both subtly and less so To start he mashed up jackets and coats with backpacks to give his tailoring a ready-for-battle attitude There were zip-up pockets front and back and on the hips some jackets were so transformed that their fronts were mere straps covering bare breasts It couldve been a silly exercise but Takahashi is a clever tailor with a wicked sense of humor In another sign hes down with the people he co-opted low-culture concert T-shirts for high-fashion purposes The Stoness young faces stared out from inside the four suits of a card deck on a miniskirt and at the hems of pants For every have-not theres a have Takahashi turned playing-card royals into a print on blazers with the kings and queens eyes blacked out like the donts on a dos-and-donts list  Royalty is a motif Takahashi has used before to equally witty effect but the vibe was slightly more incendiary this time around Oversize floral prints couldve been exploding bombs Perhaps not Either way his tweaked and twisted sportswear is easy to get behind$$Russian designer Valentin Yudashkin wanted to take a break from black a decision that could have been motivated by any number of influences outside the fashion realm but probably just boiled down to newness Thing is he does black very well and was finding his groove from a balance of precise tailoring and sexy sportswear Surely some more recently arrived clients might soon be wishing he indulged his darker side a bit longer before pivoting sharply back to color But for all the early-80s evocations Yudashkins focus remained forward He used neoprene and technical mesh inserts to update suiting day dresses and a versatile motorcycle jacket and ornamented eveningwear with acrylic geometric embellishments Yudashkin mentioned being inspired by contemporary art this season and singled out painter Piotr Uklanski as the strongest influence Indeed the drip print that seeped down a jumpsuit or splashed forth in sequins on a hot disco-worthy number nodded directly to the Polish artist However the designer was at his most original when he showed a weightless pastel dress topped with a bouncy neon green blouson this felt fresh and not overworked On the few occasions when he did seem to overwork a designthe final gowns that swirled wildly in a riot of magenta and red taffeta and tullehe did so with the conviction that this represents glamour today If you do it from the heart the customers will follow he said backstage of his vibrant collection He sounded too sincere to object$$Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking deeply about Africa when they were designing for Spring and not on a whim For more than a year tens of thousands of refugees from Senegal Nigeria Eritrea Mali Gambia and elsewhere have been making the harrowing journey across the Mediterranean to southern Italy Packed into unseaworthy vessels many are dying in appalling circumstances before they reach shore a humanitarian crisis Italy has been dealing with by patrolling the seas saving survivors and giving them sanctuary As in Germany which has been receiving hundreds of thousands fleeing from the war in Syria there has been a backlash against the new arrivals from some quarters And this is what the Valentino designers want to counteract We probably feel that the greatest privilege in doing our work is that fashion can give a message said Chiuri We think every person coming here is an individual and we can show that we can improve ourselves by understanding other cultures The message added Piccioli is tolerance And the beauty that comes out of cross-cultural expression On appearances you would not necessarily guess at the very real and fraught situation running in the background of this serene and heartfelt Valentino collection but the research and the lengths the designers had gone to to educate themselves resulted in some gorgeous fusions between Italian and African traditions They met in the textiles and the way the Roman influences Chiuri and Piccioli had used in their couture show segued into tribal treatmentsthe strips of leather that began as a gladiator reference became studded the Roman sandals gained carved ebony heels the pagan necklaces of their former show now appeared in white ceramic suggesting abstracted teeth or shells and the house expertise in embroidery produced tiny beaded Masai-derived patterns and bold peacock feather trims Both designers pointed out that their respectful borrowings are hardly new they are part of a history of Western assimilation that goes back to Picasso and Braques embrace of African art in the 1920s which Chiuri said was the birth of modernism in art It came over as most modern in this show when it was at its most subtle as in the black dress embellished with multiple layers of suede fringing or in the manipulation of tie-dye patterns used as a camouflage-like material for summer utility jackets and cargo pants In the end though while customers may not even notice the roots of the simple breezy cotton printed Valentino dresses they are buying the important thing is that the designers have used this opportunity to spell out where they stand on an issue very close to home It will definitely be heard in Italy Fashion is a frivolous and joyful thing but that doesnt prevent some of the people who are making it from having inquiring minds and a public conscience$$Vanessa Brunos flagship store had been propped with sleek modular planter boxes and bowls piled with lemons and pomegranates to create a lush ambiance for her South Americaninfluenced collection Never mind the fact that pomegranates originated in the Middle East this outing was less about geographical accuracy than an exploration of artisanal techniques Bruno in fact said she began the season by thinking about a wardrobe for a hot weather getaway and ended up refining the idea so that the clothes would be easily packable without sacrificing style She doubled down on crochet inflecting it with Parisian flair not just in form (a graphic striped bra top) but also in application (paired with crisp gauchos) Dresses eschewed volume for eye-catching finesse from grosgrain detailing to sunset hues Indeed when Bruno pointed to a dress featuring a laced crochet bodice and loosely pleated skirt as being most emblematic of the season one could envision unpacking it along with the raffia sandals and turquoise-accented jewelry and instantly entering into vacation mode As for concerns about the visibly creased cotton which might give the impression of being stuffed carelessly into a suitcase it actually contained a barely visible metal thread that acts as a memory to maintain shape It reinforced how Bruno was going for soign not starched$$Vanessa Seward opened her store on the Rue dAlger last month and from the looks of the crowd at her show today its been a busy place Amid other sightings two high-profile Parisians turned up in the same tweed blazer from her first collection for Fall in identical white jeans and almost identical cashmere sweaters Its puzzling why so few designers put pieces on the runway that could step right off it onto the street Thats why what Sewards doing with her new line is a hit The fantasy is the reality  This afternoons show started with a clever voice-over created by her husband music producer Bertrand Burgalat in which Sewards impressions of French women got the Auto-Tune treatment They have this whole effortless thing that I really admire she says over the electronic music Backstage she added Its my homage to the charm of French women Seward is no slouch in the personal style department of course She had a cosmopolitan upbringing moving first to London and then to Paris from her native Argentina and she imbued her new collection with some of that international flavor cinching Argentine gaucho belts over a couple of dresses and adding a few nods to YSL in Marrakech into the mix The silvery lam was more about time travel back to the glam 70s It looked great on a maxi dress But she didnt shy away from doing smart basics  la APC with whom shes partnered on the label either Seward makes a great trench and there was new denim in the form of an A-line button-front skirt that she paired with a T-shirt that read Vanessas Way Has a nice ring to it doesnt it$$I love the mix between schoolteacher andshowgirl Vera Wang said backstage Theres real life then theres fantasy life Thats potent material theres a reason that Luis BuuelsBelle de Jourwhich was a loose reference point here became the classic it did Indeed dichotomy has long defined Wangs ready-to-wear Masculine and feminine tailoring and flou Shes fashions punk ballerina a world-famous bridal designer who wears only black Duality was again the order of the day for her new Spring collection but the results were somewhat mixed Tailored coats topped only the barest of bandeaux and high-waisted briefs More quizzical was a structured vest that turned to reveal it was a dickey of sorts completely bare in back And the practical applications of a loose V-neck tank cropped below the bust in black mink were hard to discern Wang knows her way around a mash-up but there was a disconnect between her fancy evening dresses and the athletic mesh bras underneath that she never quite resolved Piece by piece she did beautiful work Black ostrich plumes added romance to a sleeveless blazer in nude techno gazar chrome and gold pailletteembroidered dresses were eye-catching and Wang the wedding dress queen cuts a smart pair of high-waisted cropped trousers Reality not fantasy came out on top$$New York Fashion Week is drawing to a close and while weve still got the rest of the month to see collections in London Milan and Paris New York City is where the trends take shape for contemporary labels One major theme for the mid-range set was a simpler more relaxed approach to getting dressed Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard are best known for layering particularly with their sharply tailored jackets and removable dickeys which create the illusion of wearing a cable-knit turtleneck or Perfecto jacket underneath But Spring presented a new focus that goes way beyond blazers Miami was the Beards starting point and models with wet slicked-back hair stood in front of giant palm fronds wearing crisp white separates soft suits and breezy dresses Its supposed to feel like they just jumped out of the pool and threw these clothes on Swanson Beard explained That translated to a looser less rigid approach to tailoring Even the sharpest pin-striped jacket was done in a soft piqu and clingy silk dresses were unstructured save for a drawstring waist or a row of ruched buttons on the side  Of course real-life wearability is a big factor when youre stocked in department stores and while a few looks felt a bit formulaic like a red off-the-shoulder dress others appeared more womanly than what some of the designers peers are doing And for girls looking to upgrade their dickey collection there was a brand-new style to try here lapel dickeys which were slimmer and added just a little extra dimension$$At Veronique Branquinhos Spring 2016 show today at the Htel dvreux models wore long flowing pleated dresses in muted tones of cream black and rainbow pastels (for a Victorian-meetsBurning Man effect) gauzy blindfolds and occasionally trailed macram fringe which extended from the neckline down to the ankle It would not have been a stretch to imagine them with candlesticks in hand too a series of nightgown-clad Lady Macbeths coursing through the halls of the castle with some mind-warping affairs underway There was a fair bit of deconstruction at hand if not actual Shakespearean madness well-tailored jackets and vests with the stitching picked out tasseled sheer layers with visible corsetry underneath an array of utterly bewildering transparently backed trousers exposing long white Elizabethan-style undershorts worn underneath Sheer tulle blouses possessed vaguely modesty-protecting ruffles on the breast while suit trousers occasionally boasted a thick white elastic waistband printed with the designers name  la 80s Calvin Klein A medieval-looking print of flora and fauna was pleated on some frocks to expose the bounty when the dress was in movement but most successful were the shoes chunkily heeled brogues and smoking slippers with gently sloping toes in black and shagreen red lizard and creamy white patent$$If Vronique Leroys program notes told one storyan intellectual young woman defining sexy on her own termsthe designer told another backstage after the show For Spring she tried to test the point at which seemingly mismatched outfits gain new allure She did this primarily by pushing and pulling colors proportions and materials just enough that the outcome remained a tad shy of awry Look 13 is a prime example the crinkly white and sky blue striped silk blouson and wrap skirt paired with a black camisole and saffron belt strikes as simultaneously fresh and odd The final passage made the same impact as if the rounded sleeves wide pants and mix of check knit mesh and lace delivered the sartorial equivalent of a jolie laide One imagines that Leroy spent much time calibrating the elements whether at an early design stage or the very end in styling But the coquettish black dress that repeated the same mix of mesh and lace was the opposite of overthought A long-sleeved version in white and navy turned the trusty marinire into something to lust after For all the possible traps Leroy really only slipped up with the accessories (wide asymmetric belts oversize droopy hoops openwork booties) which werent problematic in design as much as overusedalthough maybe this was part of the exercise And by the end it became clear that the low-key professional women who have supported her for decades would not need to opt into this mismatched business to find their key looks But if they feel compelled to venture slightly outside their comfort zone Leroy has them covered$$Just when you're feeling down and a little bit battered and numbed by fashion in general and perhaps thinking you've lost sight of the point of it all along comes Donatella Versace to put it to rights Before we start talking about the way her collection grabbed so many women in parts of themselves they never imagined Versace could reacheven those who like a boyish pant suit and flatswe should refer you to her soundtrack It was not just an added-on musical theme but the massively inclusive confidence-generating Transition by Violet and friends You'll have to listen to it but long story short It's a call to all women to stop listening to our inner demons and outer detractors and just get rid of everything which stops us from doing what we really want It was made for International Women's Day said Donatella Versace backstage And when I heard it I was so sure of myself I wanted to challenge myself to do something strong  Which is surely the main reason she came up with the image of combat which marched through her showa reflection of the all-too-many wars which are raging now maybe but also of the resolution of her battle with herself to throw away self-imposed restraints and just get on with making Versace relevant  Relevant We must now move toward thinking about what that oft-repeated never-defined and rather terrifying word means Perhaps relevance is emotionally felt in fashion when its clear that its not just for one type of very thin very young white girl when it also represents on behalf of color booty and admirable women who are just a weensy bit more experienced than eighteen And apart from that When it comes to design relevance in fashion also relates to where on earth the clothes are actually supposed to be worn Can many people find things to put on daily Or are we all going to continue to believe in the fiction that living in today's world is one long cocktail reception Donatella Versace addressed all that by showing a collection which never ditched the beloved character of her family's house but concentrated mostly on varying shades of daywear shown on an inclusive cast of characters The opening looks all legs with khaki tailored jackets cinched with webbing belts over micro shorts above vertiginous platforms were no surprise What came next was The Versace house print gone wild in punchy green camouflage tailored suits with slouchy boy-cut pants collaged into knits and sweatshirts and swinging along in the form of backpacksall (amaze) walking out on clogs and sporty slides  It would not be Versace without an injection of sexinessa quality which has been so out of fashion recently that many designers appear terrified of it This time Donatella Versace did show some of the requisite chiffon fluttery spilt-to-the-thigh gowns but the little curvy slashed and knotted dresses which came before them were far more interesting shown as they were on girls striding out on what amounted to decorated clogs It was a triumph which turned boredom into excitement and alienation into a visceral desire to shop Whatever forces Donatella Versace was fighting to reach this new point of clarity she won$$As of now Versus Versace as you see it here is already on sale onlineeven as the after-party with the models and invited kids from far and wide is still going on in a basement venue in London With Anthony Vaccarello at the helm as creative director Donatella Versace has turned Versus into a show-now buy-now wear-tomorrow collection a shortcut to fashion availability which no one else in the designer world has yet quite fully pulled off  But what will people be clicking on to purchase when they wake up tomorrow Interesting to speculate Vacarello is a fluent new-generation-channeler of the pulse of Versace He gets the house codesthe lion-head medallions the legginess the body-conscious cutout-and-drape shapes the tailoring One thing he has not yet delved into is the color of Versacehes a confirmed fan of black in his own collection and that hue dominated the Versus runway too However for the first time there were prints botanical florals and fruit patterns plus such things as printed denim bomber jackets and jeans It made for an impressively wide range for people all over the world to pick from and plenty of opportunity for stocking up ahead of year-end parties Still in fashion the eye always tends to go toward the outliers In this case that would be the simplest daywear look a black leather shirt over tailored hip-riding masculine pants Maybe thats about as far from a stereotypical Versace look as can be imaginedand it stood out in a good way Meanwhile who should be wearing something very similar backstage Why Donatella herself in a narrow pair of black boy-pants and a black T-shirt Surprise$$The entity that goes under the name Vetements has caused quite a quake through fashionbottom-up from nowhere Just whenby looking at mainstream corporate luxury-goods normsit seemed that cool was dead and buried and nothing alternative could ever again survive along came a couple of brothers Demna and Guram Gvasalia and their collective of friends to prove skeptics wrong Theres no faking the concrete truth of that The visible evidence of their breakout is in the number of Vetements oversized blazers and giant MA-1 jackets recycled firefighter sweaters Antwerpen slogan shirts and especially the flower-printed tea dresses with sweatshirting inserts that are being worn around the shows Nobody seems to have consulted each other on this They just went to shops women and men alike tried on the Vetements stuff loved the way it made them look and feel and impulsively paid up Thats why those impulsive ones plus a large contingent of the professionally curious enthusiastically headed to Belleville today to what turned out to be a large Chinese restaurant to see the Vetements follow-up for Spring The audience was not to be disappointed The buzz and energy in that cheap and cheerful establishment the freakishly beautiful club of the young and the strong who modeled and the wildly impressive clothes they were wearing had all the makings of an unforgettable fashion landmark At top speedDemna Gvasalia and his co-conspirators confirmed everything their following likes about their off-kilter elegant giant-jacketed tailoring and clunky romantic dresses and then bettered it all There were argyle knits under sober menswear suits sexy sawn-off skirts with Vetements-labeled thigh boots under coats brilliant flashes of neon yellow and toxic green striped mens shirts with superlong trailing cuffs and corset T-shirts Then came the dresses in a stunning number of new colorful and punchy-sophisticated ideas There were loose versions of prairie-flower prints with matching trailing coats a green Lurex yoked smock a navy polka-dot dress anchored on a black satin slip and one outstanding mauve velvet dress cut to cling and slither across the body And that was far from all After most of the crowd had filtered out into the streets Demna Gvasalia explained Theres something in the collection which means a lot to everyone whos worked on itlike those rose-printed plastic tablecloths we made into aprons and dresses were an ode to my grandmother Weve worked really hard on developing more jeans too and leather The point is that the Vetements collective has a lot of pooled talent and experience to call upon Idealistic as they are they havent started as naive lambs to the slaughter of the industry One core ally is the Russian stylist Lotta Volkova Adam who walked last in the show Other people have worked silently with them moonlighting from jobs elsewhere Demna Gvasalia himself learned the ropes at Maison Martin Margiela before setting up Vetements and getting on with proving that there can be a different way of doing things Apart from their stylistic insights into what people really want to wear it feels like the beginning of something else tooperhaps something like the power of niceness and friendship in an industry that could do with a lot more of that$$Perhaps more than ever tonights VFiles show pushed fashion decency to its very limit then went further In front of an adoring rambunctious crowd of colorfully attired demimonde-dwellers bobbing to dubstep courtesy of DJ A-Trak not to mention all who watched on Periscope and tweeted furiously five young designers or collectives took the runway with abandon They were the chosen ones as selected online by an international voting public Were breaking stereotypes said founder Julie-Anne Quay backstage These brave kids who are 22 and under represent the next generation of tastemakers the new youth culture The most compelling of the bunch conceptually speaking was Feng Chen Wang Born in Beijing and fresh out of fashion college in Britain she described the very somber basis for her collection learning of her fathers cancer diagnosis last year and taking a deep interest in the process of recovery even observing the surgery firsthand in the operating room As bleak as it sounds and rather contrary to her chirpy demeanor she made the most of the bad situation crafting clothes bursting with outsized organ shapes and zippers evoking incisions Some models wore blood bags that dripped a black liquid (not blood) into plastic tubes spelling out the words Love and Life David Ferreira based in London brought together his favorite film Orlando and Empress Dowager Cixi of nineteenth-century China As it happened some of the pieces ended up looking remarkably similar to Rihannas yellow stunner by Guo Pei at this years Met Gala (Incidentally Rihanna has sported previous VFiles designers to various events) Ferreira said he combined elements of European couture with historical Chinese dress He mentioned foot-binding but it was surely only coincidence that one model tumbled twice ripping off her shoes each time and continuing barefoot to thunderous applause  Design duo Namilia (Nan Li and Emilia Pfohl) sent out elaborate inflatables spanning the entire width of the runway and covered in naughty words and symbolsall highly unwearable to be sure but also very entertaining and well received Backstage they cited the power of Instagram and the rebellious spirit of todays pop stars The New York trio Moses Gauntlett Cheng was the most trans-centric of the group mixing and matching assorted genders and identities that along with a self-assured sashay recalled the 80s drag balls from the film Paris Is Burning Japanese designerand graduate of both Central Saint Martins and ParsonsKozaburo Akasaka also sought inspiration from an earlier decade but his was conjured from the other side of the planet Tokyo His pieces were hand-stitched and patched together from scraps of denim leather and other assorted tatters complete with cowboy boots One imagines his post-apocalyptic Wild West vision was all the rage in his hometown at the end of the last millennium When the grand finale took placea parade of all the models in all the looksthe effect was nothing short of Fellini-esque And get this Most of it either already is or will soon be available to buy online It really is a new day$$However I touch things they always look very polished I just cant help it So noted comeback kid Victor Alfaro after his show today and indeed the collection he presented proved his point The greatest part of the appeal of these clothes was their immaculateness discovered in the perfect body-skimming fit of a bias-cut silk gown or the piping detail on a white cotton jumpsuit or of course in any of Alfaros signature knits Of the latter the most eye-catching pieces were the dressy sweaters embellished with ribbon embroidery or dangling bugle beads or patchworked together with lace the items that stuck with you however were the ones that summoned a more monumental effect Alfaro has a talent for the statuesque which he deployed here in (seemingly) simple silk gowns with graphic windowpane insets terrific long-line jumpsuits and likewise lean cashmere gilets and various voluminous pants Tee-shaped dresses and quilted cargo pants introduced a sportier tone but they still had a certain Georgia OKeeffe-wandering-the-New-Mexico-desert vibe one that was ramified by garments such as a floor-length knit cape (Ellsworth Kelly meanwhile provided the punch of yellow and orange in the collections palette) The aura of self-possession in Alfaros clothes will alongside his knits remake his name in timethis 90s wunderkind seems to be taking the long view and making clothes not so much for this or any particular moment but ones built to last$$Im a sponge That might seem a very odd existential quote to come from the mouth of the distinctly un-blob-like Victoria Beckham but she was using it as a figure of speech to account for the design ideas she put into her Spring collectionfeelings she says she just picked up in passing on her nonstop travels with work and family Ive lived in LA we have the show here in New York and now obviously were back in London she said backstage so I guess Ive figured it out from that There are subliminal things in here like the surf prints but this collection is more about attitude and just making things fresh and carefree Perhaps the best way to judge Beckhams fluid just-above-the-ankle midi lengths swing dresses and flats is to compare them to what she was producing at the very beginning of her career as a designer ie fitted hourglass silhouettes tiny short dresses and eveningwear all with towering heels That is now firmly a thing of the past There was nothing on the runway that looked even remotely cocktail or red carpet in the old sense but times have changed Where there once might have been sculpted corseted bustiers now there is crinkled duchesse satin suspended from gathered necklines and where once there had been stiletto platforms here were backless loafers The distance traveled can definitely be measured in a much more grown-up idea of what sophisticated fashion is to the kind of women who inhabit or would like to move into Victoria Beckhams world The clothes read as expensive with a luxurious creamy heft and swish about them exuding a wealthy confidence that says I have achieved the perfect life but I dont need to try too hard to show that off to you$$With her second flagship store set to open its doors in Hong Kong Victoria Beckham finds herself at the helm of a brand thats an increasingly global proposition Still after hosting a dinner for London Fashion Week (and a quick call to check in on her kids) she found time to walk through the Spring 2016 offerings from her little sister line Victoria Victoria Beckham It started when we were in Marrakech for Davids birthday she said of the springboard for this season We visited the Jardin Majorelle and I was really inspired by all the tiles and the color This theme was most pronounced in the signature Majorelle Blue bloom prints that had the edifying effect of Matisses cutouts These folksy florals were reworked more delicately in off-white lace on a simple crepe shift and a neat macram sweater A laser-cut dress in intense orange delivered a kaleidoscopic kick with a level of detailing that had a mainline finish The silhouette was largely loose and relaxed with voluminous-backed cape dresses that chimed with the brands playful modern tone Ive been wearing this huge gray dress all around New York said Beckham of the starting point for these billowing shapes It felt so summery and light It made me realize that wearing volume really can be flattering Merging VVB with her denim line last season has apparently brought out Beckhams experimental side Weve pushed the denim with more techniques cuts and washes she said pointing to a pair of eyelet-flecked white tapered jeans Among these new shapes were some frayed-hem culottes complete with a belt that are sure to be on summer wish lists Happily there was still space in the collection for her best-selling flares and skinnys  The real draw here for VVBs younger customer is in the expanded presence of entry-level pieces A delicious series of T-shirts some contenders for eveningwear echoed the primary palette with leather or fuzzy-felt finish flowers Im excited about the T-shirts said the designer eyeing a white tee with contrast black collar in an oversize pop print Theyre a chance to reach out to people of varying budgets I want all women to be able to experience the brand$$A collection starring crochet and pleated slacks might intimidate all but the most intrepid fashion enthusiast (retailers included) But leave it to Russian designer Vika Gazinskaya to turn challenging ideas into charming clothes She did this by stripping away the corresponding clichs Her Spring outing was neither stuck in the 80s nor weighed down with craft Rather she relied on brushed cotton and crisp silk as her two blank slates from which to experiment with volume color and the placement of colorful appliqus some backed with functioning pockets Its just too bad that the collection is handicapped by photos that flatten the dimension of her ample silhouettes and fail to capture the humble appeal of the crochet (the flower placket and two-tone scalloped hem among the standouts) Photos also dont do justice to the rigor of Gazinskayas constructionthose sculpturally fronted tops and feminine trenches do not assume their shapes by accident Fortunately she has a sixth styling sense aware that pairing the trousers with an embellished T-shirt or silk camisole is as important at entry level (price and aesthetic) as the crochet bib over the folksy dress is at the advanced Gazinskaya remains her own most convincing muse so it will be interesting to see how soon she wears Look 6 with its odd color pairing of chocolate and peanut butter In the meantime toward the end of the walk-through she lifted up a full skirt to expose a crinoline Also under there her enduring joie de vivre$$Adventuress is a deliciously double-edged title that was used in 19th- and early-20th-century England to describe invariably hot women who were outside the bounds of society and apparently set on their insertion into it From the niggles titters and whispers that Goga Ashkenazithe commodities-pumped proprietor of Vionnetsometimes attracts one suspects that a century ago she would have been labeled an adventuress Today though it seems like what it is snobbery pure and simple  Ashkenazis project at Vionnet is sincere if sometimes touched by naivety Today fueled by the insertion of Hussein Chalayan into her team she presented a collection that convincingly tipped its hat to Madame Vionnet herselfcheck Pinterest yallplus incorporated Vionnets own classical source code Beneath the breathy wind of mood-board romanticismspanning from Peter Doigs canoe paintings to Byrons She Walks in Beautythis collection was at its essence a group of bias-cut shades-of-nude column dresses with flanks of pliss and sometimes iffy paneling jazzed up with odd handmaiden flying buttresses weighed down by sewn-in stones There were unfortunate diversions A sheer paneled black dress featured a crisscross of relief cutely taken from an upskirt photograph of the Eiffel Tower but it was still a too-sheer black dress But the sublimations of Doric relief and go-to nymph adornment onto half-caped trouser suits with sneaker-meets-gladiator sandals represented the whisper of a Platonically touched ideal spanning then and now Titter ye not Vionnet is okay$$Its always a head-spinning experience to go through a new Visvim collection with its designer Hiroki Nakamura Not only are his collections sprawling encompassing mens as well as a newer womens line (WMV) but most pieces have unusual and distinct origins that beg to be told and heard And Nakamura a gifted raconteur is more than happy to share their stories Essentially Visvim begins and ends with vintage fabric But heres the thing Nothing is actually vintage Rather each piece is created anew in the spirit of vintage usually the result of a long and international chain of artisanal workmanship Nakamura described how for example one sweater began as organic Italian cotton which was then hand-knitted in Peru before being finished in France There were also mens shoes woven out of bits of raffia in Morocco but which because the craftsmen there werent experienced with a particular shade of blue required a team of Japanese dye specialists to assist Dyeing is otherwise done in Japan as a rule as in a series of lightweight cotton dresses with an all-over checkerboard pattern made by brushing dye over rice resin in a technique called katazome That innocuous-looking plaid suit jacket Its made entirely out of paper pulp for extra breathability Aside from his obsession with vintage fabrics Nakamura is also a collector of found objects or flea-market finds things he picks up on his travels and packs into the five or six suitcases he says he takes with him on every trip He assembled a display of these items for the showing today a jar of shells he found on a beach in Montauk that he drew as a shell print for the collection a parasol from Alsace that inspired him to make an indigo-dyed umbrella a jewelry box from the 1900s that he liked for its brass studs Geta slippers whose once-bright velvet faded long ago On the topic of shoesupon which the company was founded and which still whip up enormous cult-like zealsome important news first a new sneaker style called the Roland Jogger is launching and second the famed FBT moccasin that started it all now comes with a protective leather overlay by popular demand$$Vivienne Tam built her business on lavish evening gowns that fuse her Chinese heritage with modern technology but todays show threw a wrench in that formula Spring was all about casual streetwise clothes for both girls and guys it was Tams first time casting male models in her show Traveling between New York Hong Kong and Paris I noticed people on the streets were very androgynous Tam explained before the show Girls were wearing mens clothes and men were wearing more feminine things Sure you could chalk it up to the impact Hari Nef Andreja Pejic and (most famously) Caitlyn Jenner have had on pop culture this year But transgender isnt a trend and Tam included lots of additional context too like the oft-referenced Chinese Art Deco period which saw women playing with masculine style for the first time  The show opened with a relaxed strapless gray striped ensemble that captured Tams new laid-back approach It was closely followed by a few different takes on shirting like a flouncy wrap dress and a mens charcoal jumpsuit with a ruffle down the front A lot of the best pieces however were the ones that could pass for unisex like the satin souvenir jacketsalready a big trend for falland tech-mesh bombers For the red carpet Tam showed playful mahjong-inspired dresses that were undeniably fun the game was introduced in the US during the Art Deco period Intricate dresses with embroidered rows of tiles felt whimsical but still a lot more restrained than the gilded heavily embellished dresses Tam showed in the past$$Can you reasonably rage against the machine when you are a highly profitable cog in it This is an obvious paradox inherent in Dame Vivienne Westwoods policy of using her shows as a podium from which to preach about the iniquities of mass consumerism and fossil fuel dependence Her valiant pitch at squaring that circle is the exhortation to buy less things that are better made and last longer a sentiment that while impossible to disagree with doesnt quite carry when delivered in the backstage hubbub immediately before a show of seasonal fashion Nonetheless this evenings Vivienne Westwood Red Label carnival was a corker Held in a basement space grippingly advertised outside as an Alien Sex Club the runway was overlooked by a balcony on which gathered a band of paper-crowned model/protestors holding banners hostile to politicians and shale gas extraction The soundtrack was quite frankly hellisha cacophony of sirens and garble through which occasionally stirring dialogue could be heard including the weary line Fashion is ridiculous a pathetic parody of what it used to be After the last look walked the protesters descended behind Westwood Everyone in the room dutifully took pictures then realized they had no signal The most piquant contradiction in this show was how incompatible the collection seemed with the rhetoric around it Because while the styling was absolutely maverickall smeared robber-mask eyes and sleep-in-a-tree hairthere is no other way to describe the clothes than with the C-word conservative Prettily ruched frocksfrocksin lace came layered with sweet scarlet florals Knee-length tea dresses were delicately cut and spattered with Marimekko-touched patterns Layered embroideries in manor-house interior reliefs were layered around their wearers like professionally piped icing Yes there was the odd proselytizing button or T-shirt emblazoned with a meaningful carbon footprint but subtract theseand perhaps alter some of the more laissez-bare necklinesand you could imagine the Duchess of Cambridge or Samantha Cameron appropriately shaking hands with the CEO of Shell in a great many of these looks It was as if the Sex Pistols were covering Maroon 5and it was good$$Vivienne Westwood has made a habit of using her fashion shows as a platform for activism This season she was championing two related causes In a note left for attendees at their seats she invited them to join her at the Peoples March for Climate Justice and Jobs in London on November 29 just ahead of the start of the Paris climate talks On the runway meanwhile she paid homage to Venice a city that perhaps due to climate change is sinking even faster than it was before Venice is a good theme for Westwoodher shows tend to have a certain carnival atmosphere in their mix of the decadent and the louche Youd have expected a Vivienne Westwood Save Venice collection to feature quite a few of her signature evening dresses with their bouffant skirts and baroque swirls of sculptural draping But Westwood took another tack Instead of cocktail looks she emphasized rather plainspoken daywear silhouettes shown on male as well as female models in a gesture that read less political than as an homage to the Venetian tradition of the masque The cross-dressing theme was echoed as well in the array of tailored items in particular suits that looked oversize and mannish with trousers cut to appear as though theyd been cinched up spontaneously to fit a womans smaller frame That was one of Westwoods dramatic flourishes others included poufed sleeves and hardware and crystal embellishment sewn onto jackets As far as theatrics went however Westwood saved her fire for a few spectacular pieces such as the extra-long coats worn high overhead which created a spookily huge silhouette and a bodysuit of sequin-dripping net that conjured a very fancy birdcage Needless to say those looks had quite an impact on the runway But the strongest ones at todays show were much more straightforwardWestwood still drapes a mean dress and her fluid silk frocks bunched artfully in the front made for a fine addition to her substantial oeuvre They were dressy those dresses but had such a casual mien that you could imagine wearing one to march alongside the designer in London next month$$Are you a good witch or a bad witch And furthermore who cares about that old adage when Wendy Nichol keeps making clothes that so neatly and lushly encompass both For Spring the accessories-maven-cum-cult-ready-to-wear-favorite has struck on her most winning balance since debuting her clothes back in 2011 If threads of Victoriana once were a chief characteristic of her offerings then recent seasons have seen the scales tip toward a more general more languid sort of loveliness Even the pieces marked most starkly by a sense of drama were easy to envision as appealing to many different types of bewitching women Nichols floor-grazing collarless duster for example is beloved by everyone from Beyonc to Saudi princesses and here came in a lustrous shadow-striped ivory silk with a leather tasseled belt Elsewhere a showstopping Solstiss lace gown and generously fringed bustier in buttery black leather looked like you might just run the world in them Still not all of us clock in as royalty of one sort or another on the day-to-day so Nichol has savvily begun rounding out her offerings with more traditionally wearable separates See a pair of wide-leg pants complete with a wafting overlay of chiffon or a cropped tank top and tee The designers impeccable fabrications all whipped up in her New York studio lend even those simplest of styles (including her utterly louche bias-cut skinny scarves) a feeling thats markedly special Best was a softly pleated circle skirt in pieced-togethernot printedblack and white stripes All inky at first glance but take a step back and it flashed a snowy-white undersidea bit naughty and very very nice$$Wes Gordon is one of a handful of young designers who have found themselves in a tricky position vis--vis their clientele Gordon serves what once was known as an uptown customerexcept that those women are just as likely these days to be found downtown or evenheavens to Betsyin Brooklyn and their shifting sense of style reflects the change in geography They want clothes that are luxurious and polished and feminine and that will serve at the formal occasions they are called upon to attend but they also want clothes that are functional and unfussy with a dont-mess-with-me attitude and perhaps a hint of the offbeat This is a difficult brief Gordon for his part fulfilled it capably last season finding ways to elevate a grungy vibe without losing track of its essential brooding spirit   This time out Gordon took a similar tack The silhouettes were girlier and the palette less moody and imposingthis was a Spring collection after allbut the grunge inflection remained firmly in place Gordon noted that he had photos of ultimate slacker girl-crush Winona Ryder posted up all over his studio as he prepped this collectionand at moments in looks like the silk or plaid cotton dresses with stripes of cobwebby lace sewn on in seemingly amateurish fashion he did summon Ryders characteristic demure dishevelment Elsewhere the message was more muddled There were great seam-detailed looks done in matter-of-fact charcoal linen and need-it-now marled knits which when paired with the buttery calfskin pieces provided the collection with much of its warmth There were other nice touches too like the tunics with cutout shoulders or the flourishes of iridescent chiffon Overall though Gordons effort this season to fuse upscale and edge led him down too many byways and the collection never really came into focus It could have used fewer stories better told$$Colors and prints tend to have a short lifespan in the fashion cycle so when they happen to be your signatures keeping them fresh is key One way Whit designer Whitney Pozgay manages to do that each season is by enlisting artists to collaborate on her prints from New York artist Adam Handler to her own husband Parker Argote who has painted many of her signature motifs over the years The final results are crafty and eclectic not trendy or loud (read no digital prints here) For Spring Pozgay wanted to illustrate the contrast of hot air balloons over the African savannahan image packed with opposites like hard and soft artificial and natural old and new Striking shades of poppy and lemon popped against ivory sand and black on straight midi skirts boxy shift dresses and off-the-shoulder blouses many of which were stamped with a series of tribal prints Each one was handmade like the blocky geometric print that was initially laid out with sport tape or the sweet slightly retro African lily print We wanted to reappropriate the tribal theme in a more artful way Pozgay explained She tapped Handlerwho recently showed his work at the Fred Torres Galleryto paint a giraffe across the entire front of a crisp shirtdress  Elsewhere the idea of tribal clothing was subtler and in some ways already engrained in the Whit vernacular Mixed prints wrap details and voluminous shapes are hallmarks of traditional African style but theyre also the elements Pozgay always goes back to Its all the things we love mashed together she said Its crisp and wearable and there are plays on proportion like bell sleeves with a skinny skirt but its still forward and fun$$Ruffian designers Brian Wolk and Claude Morais packed up the car for Los Angeles a year and a half ago part of the wave of westward-leaning New Yorkers Last night they presented their second collection for their new eponymous label Wolk Morais in West Hollywood and the show was a testament to how quickly theyve taken to their adopted home and put down roots Elizabeth Stewart who dresses Cate Blanchett Amanda Seyfried Julia Roberts and other celebs styled the show and her teenaged kids and their friends not only modeled in it but also inspired the clothes  Back in New York City Wolk and Morais used to be known for ladylike flounces and frills and couture-level fabrications Theyve rejiggered the formula at their new label with raw denim utility jumpsuits and sweatshirts and an occasional pair of tights for the guys who walked the show This is the right move for them Fashion is headed in a looser less-fancy direction at the moment for one and for another the raw denim looked really good especially a jumper-dress worn over a silk blouse Elsewhere Wolk and Morais had fun with print creating a digitized floral that turned up small and large on everything from those hoodie sweatshirts to cocktail numbers and event dresses They didnt leave their dressy instincts entirely behind when they left New York That makes sense too There are too many starlets and red carpets to count in their new hometown With Stewart for a fairy godmother as they call her some of those up-and-coming actresses and perhaps some very-well-established ones too could find their way into Wolk Moraiss frocks From there its not far into stores$$The idea of the outsider looking in has always fascinated Yang Li a designer whose rise to the upper echelons of Paris fashion came via Beijing Perth Australia London and Antwerp Its surprising then to note that his Spring heroine isnt concerned with the divide of East versus West but rather a more fictive trip down memory lanethat of a punk in exile returning to her bourgeois past prompted to scour her grandmothers closet and piece together a new identity That romantic metamorphosis unfolded from the get-go as Look 1 was comprised of a delicate jacquard bra top and an organza-trained cream trenchcoat that topped mannish pants and monk-strap derbies It immediately engaged a sensual rub of mid-century prettiness with Lis codes of postpunk music sharp tailoring and tough unfinished eveningwear What followed was a repetitive expansion of that framework as the designer riffed on generous pant volumes fluid-sliced camisoles and polo tops and the jarring grunge effect of silk gingham layered with leather coats or ball skirts cut in crimson inkblot florals Though a trio of patchwork tailored coats recalled Lis time under Raf Simons in Antwerp he twisted their familiarity with an artisanal touch as bold lyrics by the neo-folk group Swans were traced in hand-stitched gothic calligraphy Like an intuitive balancing act their demure counterparts followed suitsack-back bracelet-sleeved opera coats in duchesse satin or taffetacouture-like creations that held their own among the complexity of viscose trenchcoats or tailored boucl jackets peeling open with sinuous zips Sprinkled throughout the belts of those trenches were worn as fetishist buckle scarvesclasped at the neck with silver brooches picked out in studs and sprays of flora They were the totems of youth and establishment cast side by side with arresting irreverent beauty$$Kanye West only confirmed he was putting on a show last Saturday when his invitations went out but save for his friend Riccardo Tiscis 9/11 Givenchy presentation Yeezy was the event of the week Outside beforehand camera phonewielding fans swarmed the VIP door angling for a picture of Drake Lorde and Jaden Smith Just as many people were trying to scoot past security without a ticket at the main entrance Once inside the setting was comparatively serene but only until those celebrities and the designers familyKim North Khlo Kourtney and Kendallstarted to take their front row seats from then on it was pretty much pandemonium  West worked with performance artist Vanessa Beecroft for the second season going Like last time street-cast models mixed with professional ones and Kylie Jenner the designers sister-in-law put in a cameo Unlike last time West and Beecroft made the military metaphor literal enlisting real drill sergeants who called out formations Platinum-blond fair-skinned models came first and marched to the end of the runway to pose for pictures As the show progressed the clothes shaded from beiges and taupes to browns and blacks and the models hair and skin tone got darker with the darkest models and clothing coming last At the finale they arrayed themselves front to back white to black In a year in which racial injustice has occupied the headlines it was a potent tableau seemingly loaded with meaning But if West was making a statement about inequality in America he chose not to address it with this reporter When asked about the casting he said Its just a painting just using clothing as a canvas of proportion and color   Were not sure if we buy that but if West wants to put the focus on his fashion not his politics then well play along The Yeezy vibe is a consistent one Sweatshirts leggings outerwear and boots remain the backbone of the collection Its still monochrome head-to-toe and its still essentially unisex Spring does feel less shaggy than its predecessor but its just as streetwise If West makes good on his promise at the VMAs last month and does indeed run for President in 2020 hes going to have to get his campaign trail suits somewhere else$$Math isnt one of the things you hear fashion editors talk about while they wait for runway shows to start (Were right-brained people) But Yeohlee Teng likes to think about numbers and geometry when she designs her clothes At first glance Tengs Spring collection was as simple as it getsall button-down shirts scoop-neck T-shirt dresses and pencil skirtsbut most pieces were designed with equations in mind Pockets were placed in perfect 6-by-6-inch squares and a spongy bonded wool coat was cut from a giant circle The models even stood on a 36-by-36-by-12-inch platform in the middle of her tucked-away 29th Street store  Teng also considered how clothes fill up the negative space around the bodysee the rounded ecru coat with pouf sleeves which concealed the models every curve or the sheer filigree shirts which seemed to take up no space at all Of course the average shopper likely wont consider those factors when she grabs a Yeohlee parka off the rack but the emphasis on numbers and form did lend a sense of order to the designers sometimes vague aesthetic$$Its about going from step to step said Yigal Azroul of Spring and showing that progression What came of this transient mind-set was a collection that started with light (a transparent silk-twill dress with printed brushstrokes) and bowed with dramasee the all-black finale knockout with jabot lacing neck to navel Yet despite the range Azroul managed to keep his trademark cool by making sure his silhouettes never veered too far afield these clothes all have appeal and widespread at that The best piece here was a motorcycle jacket that fell somewhere in the middle of Azrouls evolutionary story its body rendered in thick architectural leather and its sleeves spun of misty chiffon embroidered with sprigs and ferns Smart and effortless with a spin Later Azroul tried colorful floral appliqus over jet lace but he was strongest when keeping the concept simpler A black-and-white guipure turtleneck turned heads and any number of PYTs might find wardrobe bliss in a little dove-gray jacket and steely filigree dress The teal and black dresses were also eye-catchingAzroul mentioned he could see Gwyneth Paltrow wearing one (Agreed) With a clean matte beauty look (slicked-backed ponies and the faintest breath of blush) this was a pleasant evolution indeed$$To witness a Yohji Yamamoto creation make its way down the runway is to wonder whether he arrived at it by accident or by deliberate design Likewise the show itself which today took place in the gloriously gilded gallery at City Hall where the acoustics amplified the silence between what may or may not have been a live music performance Turns out Yamamoto supplied the recording a one-man-jam that consisted of him singing Come into the shadows  Backstage he confirmed that the improvisational styling of the wrapped knotted and displaced looks that set the shows tone was very much on purpose Each time you wear its different he explained The clothes were also different in that he wasnt suffocating the models with an impenetrable concept Gradually however he switched into a higher historical gear hoop skirts seemed like theyd survived a tornado and excess fabric spilled out from the tops of corsets The denim tubes assembled into a skirt were Yamamotos interpretation of an 18th century crinoline that he found in a rare book on European lingerie Only someone capable of reading Yamamotos mind would have connected the dots between these exquisitely tattered looks the makeshift parasols and the all-terrain Adidas sneaker boots to arrive at his stance on climate change Earth is angry the summer is too hot and the rain becomes a storm And in hot times we need underwear in the streets he said Environmental message aside the cumulative effect was a collection that skewed cool This Yamamoto declared was also intentional My brand needs young customers At midnight he will turn 72 years young which likely explains the invitation boasting a photo of his aging hands The girl who closed the show wearing a stiffly ruffled roughed-up dress in fire engine red was equipped with a camera as part of a documentary being made about the designer Yamamoto bearing all seems unimaginable he communicates via rogue corset boning randomly painted pantaloons and shapeless shrouds But then this momenta genuine resurgencewont last forever$$Its been a big week for Zac Posen First came his diffusion line presentation which featured an LED dress he made in partnership with Google After that his debut collection for Brooks Brothers Tonight in front of Amy Schumer Christina Hendricks Jennifer Hudson and Bella Thorne he took over Grand Centrals Vanderbilt Hall with a signature collection that was surprisingly free of many of his signatures Beforehand Posen said Its important for us to keep it exciting Weve had so much red carpet it got to the point that I wanted to give a proposition for my friends and customers during the day Enter a black cotton sundress that paired with Christian Louboutin skimmers and a top-handle bag conjured St-Tropez in the 60s It was positively breezy and while the clothes didnt remain quite that low-key when he inevitably turned his eye to evening Posen approached it in a new way Without any of the engineered hourglass seaming hes famous for his long dresses had a more relaxed sensibility For surface interest he tacked floating seams with bugle beads One hundred percent harder than sewing a normal seam he said fingering a tuxedo that featured the couture technique  A guipure lace dress with a stiff yoke that extended a couple of inches above the models shoulders failed to evoke the ease Posen was after and at the other end of the spectrum a hand-crocheted top and skirt looked too crafty But missteps aside Posen did a commendable job here of extrapolating on his strengths and growing his repertoire A special shout-out for a staple seam camisole and matching pants It may not be fancy enough for the Emmys but one of those ladies should snap up the outfit for an after-party$$Zac Posen like so many has Cali on the brain The states beachy joie de vivre and the active lifestyle its residents are known for were the designers jumping-off points this season for his little sister brand ZAC Zac Posen Those notions came through in pieces like sportif dresses with aerodynamic-looking cutouts or a black shorts set which was kitted out with a peplum in honeycomb mesh Mismatched leopard-and-palm suiting had a whiff of the Venice boardwalk about it (albeit through the designers urbane lens) while he pointed to a maxi with a frond print as being particularly Coachella-ready It was in an elevated way and this reference seemed telling in a collection that was both a little sweeter and a little younger than some of Posens recent offerings Case in point separates in candy-colored stripes and a bubble-hem raincoat Elsewhere there was a standout seventies-inspired swingy pink top trimmed in marabou felt ready-made for flouncing onto chaise longues or swanning about poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel Posen wouldnt have been wrong if he had injected a bit of that same drama into some of his other daywear but the evening options here were breezier than ever A pink satin trapeze gown and another in pale aqua with tie-neck detailing were both easy and elegant With results like these wed say some California dreaming suits Posen just fine$$For Spring Zadig & Voltaires creative director Cecilia Bnstrm did not attempt to do new just to do better Its the type of corporate soul-searching approach that a brand is wise to consider after dabbling in various directions unsure which one will stick There was a laundry list of familiar Zadig & Voltaire items on view in the subterranean showroom today fringed suede breezy white cotton dresses alt-cowboy motifs embroidered denim and a crocheted sweater shrug in alpaca Masculine and feminine codes seesawed within single items (biker boots with lace laces) and lingerie pieces crossed over from night to day without constraint  Without a doubt the hero piece this season was the return of the leather dungarees an early brand best seller This latest iteration is being offered as a supple lambskin skirt and the internal team should be prepared to run production on this every season For now though Bnstrm indicated how the girl who ties an army shirt around the waist of her gold-flecked handkerchief dress embodied the brands unwavering homage to rock chicks whether in Paris or halfway around the world The candy-color suitcall it Haribo Tagada pinkmay have been the outlier among a largely neutral offering Then again the logo T-shirts consisted of three inspirational words Happy Peace and Love And for the time being though not indefinitely that would be inspiration enough$$How to make it new again That to make a long story short is the designers conundrum Maria Cornejo was feeling it particularly acutely this season with a whole new team in her studio But rather than stick to old formulasthatd be the easy thing to doshe opted to shake them up Backstage she reported that all of the fabrics were developed in house Its all exclusive but its a lot of work she said Work that paid off  In recent years Cornejo has leaned heavily on prints They havent failed her yet but this season she had only one an oversize brushstroke motif that brightened up a trio of dresses and a pajama set Here more often that not she was experimenting with rich texture from the cubic weave (looks just like it sounds) of a white sundress with wide grosgrain straps to the fringy fil coup of a tunic worn over pants to the pliss leather of an off-the-shoulder top and matching skirt Pleats Huge in 2016  Cornejos research into material culminated in a dress and coat in black-on-white cubist embroidery the graphic gridded precision of which was atypical of the designer who tends to favor curves over hard edges It wasnt just her fabrics that got a rethink either The long almost to-the-ankles silhouette was new for her too Shes particularly keen on the swagger of below-the-knee coats and coat vests Once more Cornejo worked with Bolivian artisans on hand-knits A white sweater that slouched sexily off the shoulders looked like a bona fide hit$$Down Under theres a book published in 1894 called Seven Little Australians Its about a family of seven children and all of the rebelling that ensues They wreaked havoc on [their father]    back then everything was very stitched up says Nicky Zimmermann (an Aussie herself who codesigns with sister Simone) Such bad behaviorespecially in an era of strictnesscaptured her attention for Zimmermanns Spring lineup Very mischievous the designer said I love the idea of an underlying naughtiness with these classic fabrications The 1800s came through in elements like high collars and lace sleeves but the sly insouciance was what captured interest Somehow these frilly things like a dusty pink bib-flounce top with an ivory lattice skirt or a tiered cobalt dress with noir pearling felt plausible for a weekend outing in modern-day Sydney Call it Victoriana for the Bondi Beach set And if at times it felt like a lot in terms of texture and ornateness one look at the crowd confirmed that with this brand more is more and in fact eminently wearablethere were plenty of Zimmermann flounces and filigrees throughout the room To that this brand retains two steadfast strengths One the clothes are always well made But two those clothes are often chameleonic between formal and easyand the theme this season synced nicely with this equation So why not wear bell sleeves to the Bondi Icebergs Be one of those naughty Australians$$Water water everywhere / nor any drop to drink Those lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner sprang instantly to mind upon encountering Zo Jordans new ocean-theme collection She hit her water concept hard evoking the sea in everything from the fishermans knots on the sleeves of cashmere-blend sweaters to wave-printed neoprene to tailored pieces as glittery as ocean phosphorescence All of which could have read as a bit on the nose except that Jordan put together a nicely varied wardrobe herethere was a good range to her easy-to-wear silhouettes The easy-to-wear thing is important The designer has a knack for making un-precious clothes whether a pair of slouchy cropped trousers or an anorak in tonal camouflage jacquard and shes canny about using her materials to give those utilitarian shapes a sense of elevation What she hasnt quite managed to do yet is stamp her label with a strong identitythough the women who will be snapping up Jordans terrific well-priced knits wont likely feel the need to complain about that She seems to be narrowing in on a signature look This season though the Zo Jordanness of Zo Jordan remained slightly out of focus$$From a new Paris showroom Zuhair Murad came across as particularly buoyant He showed off pictures of his delicate lacy designs for the New York City Ballet dancers and revealed that he will be designing JLos wardrobe for her gig at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas Meanwhile his starting point for Spring was sailor sensuality which despite the campy coupling offered a sea of opportunity to expand on his strengths Daywear largely consisted of nautical elements from marinire dresses in mixed-gauge knits to wide-leg sailor pants Sensitive to his clients lifestyles he steered the theme away from fisherman and toward yacht-level luxestandouts included the crisp white double-breasted captains suit and chic separates resembling naval pennants in satiny scuba material If the plunging-V shorter-than-short jumpsuit in striped sequins went overboard on cheek its exactly the type of piece that could prompt a celeb stylist tug-of-war But the cheek continued with lipstick lips planted in jacquard embroidery and more sequins In each port the women are leaving kisses mused Murad who pointed out that even the monochromatic knits featured lip motifs embedded into the mesh A coral-floral patterning reverted back to his predictable mix of sheer and sparkle Yet the look that outshone all the others was not the least bit glitz instead the satin scuba had been transformed into a solid red gown its elongated top trussed with thick grosgrain Lets call it five-alarm siren$$Fashion and Instagram are such (often saccharine) bedfellows because they are both platforms whose participants are preset for positive affirmation Yet even the most cynical London showgoers are stirred by the sense that Paula Gerbases 1205 is potentially something rather special To truly understand her womens clothes you need to briefly to think about menswear For several years Gerbase was head designer at Kilgour (the Savile Row tailoring house) which is headed up by Carlo Brandelli a compellingly intense chap whose preoccupation is the reduction of the classic masculine suit into its sublimated sculptural essence This is the touchstone upon which the super-serious Gerbase has sparked her own trajectory  Todays collection she said was partially informed by a holiday trek through the Atlas Mountains but thatpahwas just spiel Really what she was doing was whittling down shapes and concepts into a pragmatic-ish conceptual skeleton So we saw carefully slouchy nappa shirts and paneled trousers neutral nonsymmetric knits slung like minimalists' bandoliers and jackets woven of paper with corsetry inserts The color palette was deliciously dull Pliss both in nylon and silk served as the scrunchy subtext against which Gerbases Puritan withdrawal was expressed And all this came underlined by cultishly unsullied all-white Nike Air Max 90s For forensic under-the-radar neutrality in London 1205 is the label to turn to$$Let other New York City fashion designers toast the 10th anniversary of their brand by getting down and dirty Phillip Lim celebrated a decade of 31 with plain old dirt Mounds of the stuff were installed all around Lims catwalk this afternoon in an arrangement designed by architect Maya Lin As Lim revealed after the show the dirt was in fact compost that he and his team had been making from their own food waste and storing up for months I was thinking he said about where things start They start from a seed They start from dirt The compost mounds on the runway which would be de-installed post-show and delivered to local parks thus symbolized both beginnings and rebirth It was a fitting theme for this show which found Lim reprising various signatures but arranging them in a way that felt new This collection boasted a directness that some of Lims recent outings have lackedhis modus operandi here was put simply to take sporty and/or mannish looks and infuse them with a sense of romance That strategy was apparent in the most instantly appealing of the looks he showed today pinstriped pieces billowing with ruffles or collaged with floral prints But it was evidenced as well in the likewise ruffled scuba tops and the bomber jackets done in organza satin or silk This show could have been a touch more concise Lim had several strong ideas going here like the fluid paper-bag waist trousers and the taut sweaters and dresses in burlap nylon that seemed to degrade into floral metallic jacquard and he elevated the collection as a whole by focusing on its sense of hand whether in the luxe green gazar used in a matching bandeau and high-slit skirt or the delicate floral appliqu embellishing otherwise straightforward tops But there was some clutter too The cargo pants and adapted biker jackets could have stayed in the showroom for instance Those pieces werent bad they just diluted the poetry of the show as a whole Lim has made it this farthere will be plenty of time to
